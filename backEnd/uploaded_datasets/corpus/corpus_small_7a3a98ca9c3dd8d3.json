Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.\n\nWe're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.\n\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728, while deals with a \ud83d\udd25 have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a \ud83d\udce8. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\n\nEcho, Fire TV, and Kindle deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nAn Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room \u2014 and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.\n\nMore Amazon device and service deals\n\nAmazon services\n\nAudible Premium Plus \u2014 $5.95/month $14.95/month for four months (save $9/month; new customers only; get an additional $20 Audible credit)\n\nEcho Buds\n\nEcho smart displays\n\nEcho smart speakers\n\nFire tablets\n\nFire TVs\n\nNote: All Fire TVs come with a free 6-month subscription to MGM+ (a $35.94 value).\n\nFire TV streaming devices\n\neero\n\nKindles\n\nMiscellaneous Amazon devices\n\nApple deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nNow that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349. Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that's now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.\n\nMore Apple deals\n\nAirPods\n\nMacBook\n\nMac\n\niPad\n\nApple Watch\n\nTV deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThis 65-inch Fire TV from Amazon hit its lowest ever price this month, and we're not mad about it. With a 66 percent five-star review rating, it's got much to love: Including stunning 4K QLED resolution, adaptive brightness that adjusts to the lighting of your room, the ability to project famous art or personal pics on it when not streaming anything, and, of course, that quintessential Alexa voice control.\n\nMore TV deals\n\n43 to 55 inches\n\n65 inches\n\n75 to 85 inches\n\nLaptop deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nMacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air \u2014 the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.\n\nMore laptop deals\n\nTraditional laptops\n\n2-in-1 laptops\n\nChromebooks\n\nGaming laptops\n\nHeadphone and earbud deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nNarrowing down a headphones upgrade from so many on-sale options is less overwhelming when you've confirmed that you want to stick with a super premium, super reputable brand like Bose \u2014 but also that you want to stick to a budget. There's only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that's the QuietComfort 45s at a record-low price of $199. This classic pair secures top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and all-day comfort for less than half of the AirPods Max's sale price.\n\nMore headphone and earbud deals\n\nHeadphones\n\nEarbuds\n\nTablet deals\n\nGaming deals\n\nGaming headsets\n\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

    "body": "ETF provider Betashares, which manages $30 billion in funds, reached an agreement to acquire Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\u2019s superannuation business, in its first venture into the superannuation sector. Betashares said it was part of a longer-term strategy to expand the business into the broader financial sector. Shares in Bendigo increased 0.6 per cent on the news. REITS (up 0.4 per cent) was the strongest sector on the index as Goodman added 0.5 per cent and Dexus climbed 2.8 per cent. The laggards Casino operator Star Entertainment Group\u2019s shares hit an all-time low of 60\u00a2 after it raised $565 million. They closed the session 16 per cent weaker at 63\u00a2. Star, which raised $800 million in February, has had to return to the market for fresh funding and is hoping to raise $750 million at a share price of 60\u00a2 a share.\n\nMeanwhile, healthcare heavyweight CSL shed 1.4 per cent, weighing down the healthcare sector and insurance companies IAG (down 2.6 per cent) and Suncorp (down 2 per cent) gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Gold miners Newcrest (down 2.1 per cent) and Evolution (down 3.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners after the spot gold price dropped 0.9 per cent overnight. Information technology (down 1.1 per cent) was the weakest sector on the local bourse with WiseTech losing 1.4 per cent. The lowdown\n\nNovus Capital senior client adviser Gary Glover said the Australian sharemarket was surprisingly resilient following a negative lead from Wall Street and the latest inflation data, with markets starting to wake up to the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. \u201cConsidering the damage overnight in the US, Australian markets held on pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be a bigger down day across the board.\u201d Glover said the market was volatile but quite range-bound, similar to previous periods of high inflation in the 1940s and 1970s. Elsewhere, Wall Street\u2019s ugly September got even worse on Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 per cent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones dropped 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 per cent.\n\nLoading September has brought a loss of 5.2 per cent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realisation sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again on Tuesday following a mixed batch of reports on the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 per cent from 4.54 per cent late on Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It\u2019s up sharply from about 3.5 per cent in May and from 0.5 per cent about three years ago. One economic report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers was weaker than economists expected. That\u2019s concerning because strong spending by US households has been a bulwark keeping the economy out of a long-predicted recession.\n\nBesides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another US government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country. Loading Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 per cent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 per cent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward. Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by US autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of US student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households.\n\nOn Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell under such pressures, including 90 per cent of those within the S&P 500. Big Tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. In China, concerns continued over heavily indebted real estate developer Evergrande. The property market crisis there is dragging on China\u2019s economic growth and raising worries about financial instability. France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1 per cent.\n\nCrude oil prices rose, adding to worries about inflation. A barrel of benchmark US crude climbed 71\u00a2 to $US90.39. Brent crude, the international standard, added 67\u00a2 to $US93.96 per barrel. Tweet of the day Quote of the day \u201cThe Senate committees have the power to summons witnesses within Australia but have no enforceable powers for witnesses who are overseas,\u201d said Senator Bridget McKenzie as former Qantas boss Alan Joyce chose not to front the Senate select committee into the federal government\u2019s decision to reject extra flights from Qatar Airways due to \u201cpersonal commitments\u201d."

    "body": "Match may have settled its antitrust lawsuit with Google last week, but Fortnite maker Epic Games is still set to go to trial with the tech giant today, November 6, in hopes of convincing a jury that Google engages in anticompetitive behavior with regard to its Android app store, Google Play, and its commission structure. This case will differ slightly from Epic\u2019s battle with Apple on the same topic because, this time, Epic can\u2019t allege there\u2019s no other way to load apps onto Android devices, as it could with Apple, because Android does allow for sideloading apps. Though Epic will suggest Google makes that process cumbersome, the bulk of its arguments will center around what it believes are anticompetitive agreements between Google and device manufacturers and developers.\n\nThe precedent Epic\u2019s case will rely on is a Microsoft case where courts found Microsoft to have a monopoly over the operating system and were abusing it, making it hard for users to download alternative browsers, like Netscape, on Windows devices.\n\nTo make its case, Epic plans to bring claims under Sections 1 and 2 of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, as well as California\u2019s anticompetitive laws, the Cartwright Act, and the Unfair Competition Law. It will attempt to argue that Google restrains competition within two separate markets, including the distribution of apps to Android users and the market for payment processing solutions for content inside Android apps.\n\nGoogle argues its commissions aren\u2019t just tied to billing, but offers discount for third-party billing options\n\nToday, Google requires apps to use its own first-party billing system, and charges app developers a 15% to 30% commission on the sales it processes.\n\nHowever, Google will counter Epic\u2019s arguments by pointing out that it has rolled out a new option for app developers called User Choice Billing, which Epic has declined to use. This program, still in pilot testing, is open to all developers who sell apps in the 35 markets where it\u2019s now available, including the U.S., and reduces the standard commission by 4% for companies who choose to use their own payment processing solution. Spotify and Bumble were the initial testers for the new system, first introduced in November 2022, and Match, as part of its settlement agreement, will also now take advantage of this option.\n\nGoogle will also argue that its commissions aren\u2019t just tied to payment processing, but rather help it to develop other features and controls to keep Android users safe and guide them to discovering new applications, as well as help fund the tools and services developers need to build and grow their apps. Google also helps developers reach a broader audience beyond the mobile phone, with support for Android across platforms, ranging from tablets to TVs to autos and more. And it will note that 99% of its developers qualify for a commission of 15% or less, based on their revenues.\n\nThe competitive landscape with other app stores, OEMs\n\nThe tech giant additionally plans to push back at Epic\u2019s claims that it doesn\u2019t have competition in the app store business. It will point out that not only does the Play Store compete with Apple\u2019s App Store, which the Ninth Circuit ruling in the Apple case agreed upon, too, but Android also supports competitive app stores like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Store and Amazon\u2019s Appstore.\n\nEpic, however, will attempt to demonstrate that Google makes it hard for alternative app stores to succeed and reach consumers, noting that 90% of apps are still downloaded through Google Play. And it will point out that Google bundles the Play Store with other Google apps that Android OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have to agree to in order to use Android.\n\nEpic will also bring up \u201cAnti-Fragmentation Agreements\u201d (AFAs) that prevent the OEMs from modifying Android to allow for frictionless downloading of apps outside of Google Play. Epic Games will specifically reference one agreement it had made with the OEM OnePlus, to make Epic games available on its devices through the Epic Games app. But OnePlus had to cancel the deal over concerns that the arrangement would have it bypassing the Google Play Store. The case will also examine a deal between Google and Samsung that Epic says was designed to prevent the Galaxy Store from being a competitive threat and require Google Play Billing on apps distributed by Samsung.\n\nEpic will argue Google\u2019s developer agreements are anti-competitive\n\nA second set of agreements Epic will highlight are those between Google and Android app developers themselves. One such program, the \u201cProject Hug\u201d initiative, a part of the Google Games Velocity Program, will be cited as an example of where Google paid competitors not to distribute their apps on Android outside of the Play Store by targeting those that were most at risk of attrition from Play, then approaching them with a monetary offer. As an example, Epic will point to Activision Blizzard, the owner of King.com and maker of Candy Crush and Call of Duty, as one developer that wanted to go the route of opening its own app store. Google and Activision Blizzard then entered into a three-year agreement in January 2020, worth approximately $360 million, to keep the developer on Google Play, Epic will argue.\n\nGoogle, however, will characterize this program as a way to incentivize developers to launch their apps on Android at the same time as they launch on iOS and plans to dispute Epic\u2019s claims that it prevented developers from opening their own app stores.\n\nAndroid allows sideloading\n\nGoogle will make note that, unlike Apple, it also allows apps to be sideloaded on Android devices \u2014 something Epic takes advantage of today. It will note this process is streamlined and helps keep users safe. But Epic will claim that this process is made to be overly difficult for end users, with multiple steps involved and \u201cscare screens\u201d that warn users of the security risks involved with sideloading.\n\nEpic will also suggest that Google hid items from discovery by allowing execs and employees to have \u201coff the record\u201d chats, but Google will counter this as well, saying it has provided the court with thousands of chat logs and millions of documents.\n\nThe tech giant will ultimately push the notion that this case isn\u2019t about competition, but about money \u2014 that is, Epic Games wants to reach the Play Store\u2019s 2.5 billion users without having to pay.\n\n\u201cAndroid\u2019s choice and flexibility work well for consumers and developers of all sizes. We look forward to making our case in court as we fight to keep our users safe from harm, partner with developers to grow their businesses, and keep the Android ecosystem thriving and healthy for everyone,\u201d reads a Google blog post by Wilson White, VP, Government Affairs & Public Policy.\n\nEpic\u2019s lawsuit originally involved Match and several U.S. attorneys general, but Google reached a settlement with the latter last month and with Match last week. Epic will now fight the antitrust battle on its own. The lawsuit, held in the U.S. District Court in California\u2019s Northern District, will include testimony from a number of Google and Android execs, including CEO Sundar Pichai, and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, as well as Apple, Netflix and other Android developers.\n\nGoogle is also involved in another antitrust lawsuit with the Department of Justice over its alleged search monopoly. Epic, meanwhile, lost its antitrust battle with Apple and is now asking the Supreme Court to weigh in."

    "body": "Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nA few months ago, Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, tweeted that if he could go back in time and do one thing differently when he was building Reddit, he would have spent significantly less time attending events. Personally I have a different experience \u2014 I always regret getting on a plane (or in an Uber, for that matter) to go to an event. However, as I\u2019m traveling back, I\u2019ve never regretted it: There\u2019s always something magical that comes out of going to an event, in my experience.\n\nOur TC+ team is not interested in anecdotes, however: neither mine nor Alexis\u2019. So, like the data-driven journalists they are, they surveyed more than 50 founders, trying to figure out whether attending events still makes sense in 2023.\n\nSpoiler alert: There isn\u2019t a real consensus, but there are some really good pros and cons. The article is well worth a read, to figure out in which circumstances you can expect a decent return on investment on your event-going antics.\n\nToday\u2019s newsletter is going to be a bit more to the point than usual: I\u2019m laid up at home with pneumonia (yes, I really am an 86-year-old grandmother. Surprise!), so forgive the antibiotics-addled ramblings this week. I hope I\u2019ll be back with non-pharmaceutically-enhanced ramblings next week.\n\nArtificial intelligence: Y\u2019all just can\u2019t get enough\n\nOur most-read stories consistently continue to be about AI. No big surprise, perhaps, the AI hype cycle continues apace. This week there\u2019s been a bunch of stories about the seedy underbelly of AI, including how humans are part of the problem, continuing to trick AI systems into generating boobs and 9/11 memes. Oh, humans. We spoke with investors to figure out whether the future of AI has hope for us beyond daft memes. (Spoiler alert: Yes.)\n\nRumors are swilling that OpenAI may be considering developing its own AI chips. That\u2019s going to get interesting, especially if you\u2019ll recall that Nvidia\u2019s ongoing stock market rally is likely driven by the current boom in AI. The company\u2019s ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hit a record $4.6 million in revenue last month, but growth is slowing. Oh, and there\u2019s no need to shed tears for Nvidia quite yet; Brian\u2019s piece breaking down how Nvidia became a major player in robotics is super interesting.\n\nAdobe has doubled down on its Firefly generative AI models. This week, Frederic covered how the software can now generate more realistic images and can help artists create vector graphics in Illustrator. Neato.\n\nMore on the AI front\n\nIf AI can\u2019t go to the mountain, the mountain will come to AI: Dutch startup Tidalflow exits stealth with backing from Google\u2019s Gradient Ventures. It is aiming to help any software play nice with ChatGPT and other LLM ecosystems.\n\nWhat big eyes you have: Adobe continues to push for easier image editing, showing off its Project Stardust as a sneak preview of its next-gen AI photo editing engine.\n\nHolding back the tide: Creatives across industries are strategizing in a campaign that targets potential corporate abuse of AI technology. The conglomeration is realistic about the ways that musicians and some other creatives could benefit on an individual level from automating parts of their work. The goal is that AI tools \u201cbecome ways for individual humans to make more money, work less, and compete with the corporations that exploit them.\u201d\n\nTech you can touch\n\nA while back I argued that Apple\u2019s new AR headset is a game-changer for startups. It seems that\u2019s likely the case at the high end. But more in the realm of affordability, Meta Quest 3 takes a step closer to mainstream AR/VR, Brian reports.\n\nNot Sonos fast there: Audio company Sonos scored a big $32.5 million win against Google a while back. Now it transpires that the company\u2019s patents were deemed unenforceable and invalid. Whoops. A federal judge threw out the $32.5 million win this week.\n\nWhen it clicks, it really clicks: We took a deep look at Pixel 8, and our team discovered that it delivers solid performance and design upgrades. The camera got a particularly enthusiastic shout-out, with Darrell declaring that Google\u2019s Pixel 8 Pro camera is the new mobile photography champ, and Brian waxing lyrical about the phone\u2019s picture-snapper in \u201cThe camera\u2019s still the thing.\u201d\n\nWho needs computers anyway?: It seems like all our mobile devices may be starting to cannibalize sales of personal computers \u2014 Ron reports that PC shipments decline slows in Q3 2023 and that Apple\u2019s sales plunge over 23%.\n\nLet\u2019s get together\n\nReddit\u2019s API-powered chaos continues, but it appears that things are starting to resolve a little. Third-party Reddit app Narwhal says it hopes to survive Reddit\u2019s app purge with a subscription plan.\n\nApropos \u201cgetting together,\u201d Amanda reports that VidCon is still kickin\u2019. For the first time, the conference hosted an industry leadership summit, where creator economy experts and creators could hash out their grievances with the state of the business and share ideas to make the job of a creator more sustainable. That makes sense, unlike creators raising venture capital: It\u2019s so eye-wateringly hard to make money as a creator, I\u2019d love to see the pitch that convinces a VC to cut a check to a creator, with a realistic expectation of a venture-scale return.\n\nMaybe they were hiding behind the sofa?: Sarah reports that Mastodon actually has 407K+ more monthly users than it thought \u2014 and it seems like Twitter has a lot more traffic than Musk said. Still, the peak now is about the same as it was a decade ago, and it\u2019s unclear what the social platform can do to encourage more growth.\n\nA social social network network: Lauren reports that a former TikTok employee is building a social app for content creators to network and \u201cspill the tea,\u201d so creators can help each other out making better, more engaging content.\n\nX may go ad-free?: It appears that X (formerly Twitter) is testing three tiers of its Premium service, its CEO says. Under the hood, code shows one tier may be ad-free. If it\u2019s also troll free, please take my money right now.\n\nTop reads on TechCrunch this week\n\nA lot of amazing news on the site this week, but if we go by the raw numbers, here are the most popular stories \u2014 the ones that I didn\u2019t already cover above, that is.\n\nPasswords? We don\u2019t need no steenkin\u2019 passwords: Passkeys are a phishing-resistant alternative to passwords that allow users to sign in to accounts using the same biometrics or PINs they use to unlock their devices or with a physical security key. Google is now making it the default sign-in method for all users.\n\n2 sec, let me text you some cash: When questioned about Mastercard\u2019s prospects in emerging markets such as India, Mastercard\u2019s CFO Sachin Mehra praised UPI for helping with digitization but voiced reservations about its commercial sustainability, saying it is an \u201cincredibly painful experience\u201d for ecosystem participants.\n\nBravely browsing \u2014 or searching \u2014 for a new job . . . : Brave Software, the maker of Brave Browser and Search, confirmed that it has laid off 9% of its workforce across departments."

    "body": "The first link between Swift and Kelce was established in 2016, when Kelce \u2013 who helped bring his team to Super Bowl victory in both 2020 and 2023 \u2013 played the classic game \u201cKiss, Marry, Kill\u201d. Speaking with AfterBuzz TV, Kelce was given the options of Swift, Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. He said he\u2019d ultimately kill Grande, marry Perry and kiss Swift. That was about six years ago, but it has more recently set tongues wagging as fans wondered how long the plan for them to meet has been in the works. Cruel Summer Fast-forward seven years, and things started to heat up. In July, speaking on the podcast he shares with his brother, New Heights, Kelce said he intended to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City. Unfortunately, the bracelet never made it to her wrist or his digits to her phone.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal[sic].\u201d At this point, it seems like any attraction between the two was one-sided. Kelce\u2019s attempts to make proper contact with Swift at the show ultimately failed. Was she just not that into him? But Kelce, exhibiting the tenacity typical of a professional sportsman, remained determined to get her attention. Wildest Beards The Kelce brothers couldn\u2019t stop talking about Swift, even though she\u2019d left Travis hanging at the concert. Swift\u2019s name began popping up everywhere on the podcast, including during conversations about... facial hair?\n\nIn August, the brothers discussed Kelce\u2019s moustache, which he grows every year in honour of the Chief\u2019s head coach, Andy Reid. When asked if he knew what Swift thought of the \u2019stache, he remained cheekily confident. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode,\u201d he says, \u201cBut something tells me she\u2019s going to like it.\u201d There was a clear suggestion Kelce had made contact with Swift, and was even going to meet her. Shortly after that remark, Kelce took a week off training to visit New York City, according to Vulture. Coincidentally, this happened to be while Swift was re-recording her 1989 tracks in the city. Welcome to New York\n\nThe suspicion the two were actually spending time together in New York was seemingly confirmed in September when it was reported they had been \u201cquietly hanging out\u201d for months. This was the first, albeit tentative, confirmation from the media rather than from amateur Swiftie sleuths on social media. So, it was only a matter of time before it entered the cultural zeitgeist. Blank Space Which it did, very quickly. On September 17, Kelce scored a touchdown against the Jaguars, triggering CBS announcer Ian Eagle to reference Swift\u2019s 2014 hit, Blank Space.\n\n\u201cKelce finds a blank space for the score,\u201d Eagle said, poking fun at Kelce\u2019s newfound Swiftie status. And Eagle wasn\u2019t the only one, with NFL Network\u2019s Rich Eisen including a slew of lyric references during a preshow, including \u201cshake it off\u201d, \u201canti-hero\u201d and \u201call too well\u201d. Kelce even acknowledged the tongue-in-cheek banter, commenting on a montage video of the preshow that Eisen posted to Instagram. \u201cWell played Rich \u2026 Well played,\u201d he wrote. Suddenly, football fans and Swifties were living through this surprising collision. Swift lyrics were infiltrating NFL game commentary, and her fans were furiously becoming football experts. All that needed to happen was for Swift herself to infiltrate a game, determining once and for all whether there was anything to these rumours or not. This Is Me Trying\n\nOn September 21, Kelce announced on The Pat McAfee Show he had invited Swift to watch one of his games. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock a stage at Arrowhead and we can see which one\u2019s a little more lit,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u201d Were they finally about to hard-launch their friendship/potential romance to the world, laying all speculation to rest? Love Story This finally brings us to the fated sighting of Swift at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday, cheering on No. 87 with gusto.\n\nThe 12-time Grammy winner appeared to shout \u201clet\u2019s f\u2014ing go\u201d after Kelce scored a touchdown before chest-bumping other Chiefs fans. Considering Swift is known for being an Eagles fan \u2013 she\u2019s originally from Pennsylvania and even references the team in Gold Rush \u2013 her outward support for the Kelce\u2019s team seemed extra telling. Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn\u2019t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce\u2019s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the \u201c1989 bedroom painting set\u201d, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift\u2019s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift\u2019s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren\u2019t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a \u201cgetaway car\u201d together outside the stadium \u2013 potentially a nod towards her 2017 track. Could they have been driving off into the sunset? Of course, none of this actually confirms Swift and Kelce are actually dating. But regardless of whether it\u2019s a friendship or a romantic relationship, it has sent shockwaves through two massive cultural franchises, expanding the NFL\u2019s audience into uncharted territory. It\u2019s a cultural pairing on par with \u2013 and perhaps even bigger than \u2013 Kim Kardashian and Kanye West."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nTravis Kelce has hilariously confessed that he attempted to delete some of his tweets before they went viral.\n\nThe 34-year-old football star spoke candidly about his previous posts on X - formerly known as Twitter - during an episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, which aired on 22 November. The comments came after some of Kelce\u2019s funny tweets from 2010 and 2011 resurfaced amid his rumoured relationship with Taylor Swift.\n\nWhen Jason quipped that everyone is \u201ca big fan of college Travis on Twitter\u201d, the Kansas City Chiefs star acknowledged that his posts weren\u2019t really noticed back then. However, Kelce explained that he was trying to remove his tweets from social media even before they went viral.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hilarious is that nobody followed me back then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will say I have been trying to get all those tweets deleted. Like since I got into the league, I\u2019m like: \u2018Gosh, I just want all those things to get deleted.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe poked fun at how his tweets are now being mocked, adding: \u201cAnd sure enough, it came surface-level and everybody f***ing dove in, in 2011. What a f***ing year that was.\u201d\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles star continued to discuss the viral responses to his brother\u2019s tweets. He even referenced how Jimmy Fallon and his band performed a song, titled \u201cThe Ballad of Travis Kelce\u201d, on The Tonight Show - in which the late-night host recited Kelce\u2019s old tweets. The two brothers highlighted the now fan-favourite post, which reads: \u201cI just gave a squirle a piece of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.\u201d\n\nKelce later revealed the meanings behind some of his viral tweets, noting that he would simply share the remarks for fun. \u201cI was just using Twitter like a diary. I\u2019m just out here saying nonsense - \u2018I just gave a squirrel a piece of bread\u2019 - and spelled squirrel like a jacka**,\u201d Kelce said.\n\nJason mocked his brother for his spelling of \u201csquirrel\u201d in the tweet, before claiming that\u2019s the reason why the post went viral in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m only spelling squirrel like that from now on, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s spelled the other way,\u201d he joked. \u201cThis one gets crushed, but I think the only reason it\u2019s getting crushed is because of the spelling. Outside of that, if I\u2019m throwing bread around and a squirrel is eating it I\u2019d be pretty pumped up.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, fans of the A-list couple took to X to share screenshots of some of Kelce\u2019s old tweets - including one post from 2010 that reads: \u201c#Chipotle will always be a great choice!!!!\u201d\n\nThe NFL player\u2019s tweets have unsurprisingly resurfaced amid his relationship with Swift, who he\u2019s been romantically linked to since the summer. The dating speculation first began in July, when Kelce confessed that he tried and failed to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour show. On his podcast, he later invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to one of his games at Arrowhead Stadium - an invitation she famously accepted on 24 September. Since then, Swift has attended three more of Kelce\u2019s games.\n\nKelce showed his support for Swift when he attended her Eras Tour show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 November. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her \u201cKarma\u201d lyrics to reflect their relationship. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response. The \u201cAll Too Well\u201d singer was later seen running into his arms and kissing the NFL player following the concert, as he whisked her away backstage.\n\nIn an interview withWSJ Magazine published on 20 November, Kelce described how much he admires Swift\u2019s skills as a musician. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I\u2019m learning every day,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the public attention his personal life has received because he\u2019s \u201cnever dated anyone with that kind of aura around them,\u201d Kelce specified that he\u2019s not letting the media affect his relationship.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life.\n\n\u201cWhen she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d"

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nTaylor Swift has officially been named Time\u2019s 2023 Person of the Year.\n\nOn Wednesday 6 December, the magazine announced Swift had earned the honour after an \u201ceditors\u2019 assessment of the individual who most shaped the headlines over the previous 12 months, for better or for worse\u201d.\n\nThe recognition of Swift comes on the heels of a whirlwind year for the popstar, whose Eras Tour dominated ticket sales in 2023. \u201cThis is the proudest and happiest I\u2019ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Swift told Time. \u201cUltimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there\u2019s only one question... Are you not entertained?\u201d\n\nSwift was chosen among a strong list of contenders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, King Charles III, the live-action Barbie movie, and Vladimir Putin. \u201cWhile her popularity has grown across the decades, this is the year that Swift, 33, achieved a kind of nuclear fusion: shooting art and commerce together to release an energy of historic force,\u201d the magazine said about its selection.\n\nThis year alone, Swift has broken records with her career-spanning Eras Tour, which is estimated to have grossed over $1.4bn. Her concert film, the Eras Tour movie, has surpassed $250m at the global box office since its opening weekend in October. Not to mention her rumoured relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce caused a 400 per cent spike in NFL jersey sales.\n\nSince her first NFL appearance in September, Swift\u2019s occasional attendance at Kelce\u2019s games has received pushback from NFL fans who believe her presence is distracting from the game itself. \u201cI\u2019m just there to support Travis,\u201d Swift admitted. \u201cI have no awareness of if I\u2019m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.\u201d\n\nShe playfully added: \u201cFootball is awesome, it turns out. I\u2019ve been missing out my whole life.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBad Blood\u201d singer revealed that their romance began when Kelce gave her shoutout on his podcast, admitting he attempted to give Swift his phone number after one of her Eras Tour shows. The pair immediately began \u201changing out\u201d and by the time she attended her first Chiefs game in September, they were already a couple. \u201cI think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,\u201d Swift joked.\n\nBack in April, it was revealed that Swift and British actor Joe Alwyn had broken up after six years of dating. The former couple were notoriously private, as the Conversations with Friends star previously expressed he didn\u2019t want to discuss their relationship because it \u201cfeeds into a weird part of the culture\u201d.\n\nNow, Swift has shared that she has nothing to hide in her new relationship with Kelce. \u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Time, Swift detailed exactly how much work went into preparing for her Eras Tour - where each concert spans over 180 minutes, with more than 40 songs from at least nine albums and 16 costume changes. \u201cEvery day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cFast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.\u201d\n\nShe also stopped drinking and underwent three months of dance training, something that she admitted is \u201cnot my strong suit\u201d. After she plays a run of shows, Swift said she takes a day to rest and recover before taking the stage once again. \u201cI do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,\u201d she revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream scenario.\u201d\n\nMost recently, a heat wave in Brazil forced Swift to postpone the second night of her Eras Tour shows in Rio de Janeiro. The decision came after one of the singer\u2019s fans, 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides, died from a cardiac arrest during Swift\u2019s first performance in the country. Swift explained to Time that \u201cpart of my identity as a human\u201d is putting on a show for her fans, no matter the circumstances. \u201cI know I\u2019m going on that stage whether I\u2019m sick, injured, heartbroken, uncomfortable, or stressed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of my identity as a human being now. If someone buys a ticket to my show, I\u2019m going to play it unless we have some sort of force majeure.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was her decision to re-record her music catalogue that catapulted Swift into such success. When music mogul Scooter Braun aquired Swift\u2019s longtime label, Big Machine Records, in 2019, he also gained the rights to the master recordings of Swift\u2019s first six studio albums. In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to an investment fund in a deal that was believed to be over $300 million. Since then, Swift has released four \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums: Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) in April 2021, Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) in November 2021, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) in July 2023, and 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) in October 2023.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that the two great catalysts for this happening were two horrendous things that happened to me,\u201d Swift said, when asked about the success of her tour. \u201cThe first was getting cancelled within an inch of my life and sanity. The second was having my life\u2019s work taken away from me by someone who hates me.\u201d\n\nWhile Swift is arguably more famous now than ever before, the Grammy winner revealed that the constant attention and swarms of paparazzi won\u2019t stop her from living her life. There\u2019s also constant rumours surrounding her personal life, specifically rumours about her relationship with Alwyn that her publicist, Tree Paine, was forced to publicly deny.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don\u2019t matter,\u201d Swift told Time. \u201cYes, if I go out to dinner, there\u2019s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.\n\n\u201cLife is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I\u2019ll never get that time back,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m more trusting now than I was six years ago.\u201d"

    "body": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s viral AI chatbot, turns one today.\n\nA year ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d \u2014 reportedly spurred in part by an intense rivalry with AI startup Anthropic. The goal, OpenAI leadership told the OpenAI rank-and-file at the time, was to gather more data on how people use and interact with generative AI to inform the development of OpenAI\u2019s future models.\n\nInitially a basic free-to-use, web-based and chat-focused interface on top of one of OpenAI\u2019s existing models, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT would go on to become the company\u2019s most popular product\u2026 ever \u2014 and the fastest-growing consumer app in history.\n\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nIn the months following its launch, ChatGPT gained paid tiers with additional features, including a plan geared toward enterprise customers. OpenAI also upgraded ChatGPT with web searching, document analyzing and image creating (via DALL-E 3) capabilities. And, leaning on speech recognition, voice synthesis and text-image understanding models developed in house, OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to \u201chear,\u201d \u201cspeak,\u201d \u201csee\u201d and take actions.\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT became priority number one at OpenAI \u2014 not simply a one-off product but a development platform to build upon. And, as often happens in a competition-driven marketplace, it shifted the focus at other AI firms and research labs, too.\n\nGoogle scrambled to launch a response to ChatGPT, eventually releasing Bard, a more or less comparable AI chatbot, in February. Countless other ChatGPT rivals and derivatives have arrived to market since, most recently Amazon Q, a more business-oriented take on ChatGPT. DeepMind, Google\u2019s premier AI research lab, is expected to debut a next-gen chatbot, Gemini, before the end of the year.\n\nStella Biderman, an AI researcher at Booz Allen Hamilton and the open research group EleutherAI, told me that she doesn\u2019t see ChatGPT as an AI breakthrough per se. (OpenAI, which has released dozens of research papers on its models, tellingly never released one on ChatGPT.) But, she says, ChatGPT was a bonafide \u201cuser experience breakthrough\u201d \u2014 taking generative AI mainstream.\n\n\u201cThe primary impact [ChatGPT] has had [is] encouraging people training AIs to try to mimic it, or encouraging people studying AIs to use it as their central object of study,\u201d Biderman said. \u201cPreviously you needed to have some skill, albeit not be an expert, to consistently get usable stuff out of [text-generating models]. Now that that\u2019s changed \u2026 [ChatGPT has] brought a very large amount of attention to and discussion about the technology.\u201d\n\nAnd ChatGPT still gets a lot of attention \u2014 at least if third-party statistics are anything to go by.\n\nAccording to Similarweb, the web metrics company, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT web portal saw 140.7 million unique visitors in October while the ChatGPT iOS and Android apps have 4.9 million monthly active users in the U.S. alone. Data from analytics firm Data.ai suggests that the apps have generated nearly $30 million in subscription revenue \u2014 a hefty amount considering that they launched just a few months ago.\n\nOne of the reasons for ChatGPT\u2019s enduring popularity is its ability to conduct conversations that are \u201cconvincingly real,\u201d according to Ruoxi Shang, a third-year PhD student at the University of Washington studying human-AI interaction. Prior to ChatGPT, people were already familiar with chatbots \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for decades after all. But the models powering ChatGPT are much more sophisticated than what many users were accustomed to.\n\n\u201cHuman-computer interaction researchers have studied how conversational interfaces can improve understandability of information, and the socialization aspects of chatbots bring increased engagement,\u201d Shang said. \u201cNow, AI models have enabled conversational agents to conduct conversations nearly indistinguishable from human dialogues.\u201d\n\nAdam Hyland, also a PhD student studying AI at the University of Washington, points out the emotional component: conversations with ChatGPT have a palpably different \u201cfeel\u201d than with more rudimentary chatbots.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, ELIZA offered a chatbot, the response to which was very similar to how people reacted to ChatGPT,\u201d Hyland said, referring to the chatbot created by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. \u201cHumans interacting with the system inferred emotional content and a narrative through line in chat messages.\u201d\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT has impressed cynics like The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Roose, who called it the \u201cthe best AI chatbot ever released to the general public.\u201d In The Atlantic magazine\u2019s \u201cBreakthroughs of the Year\u201d for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \u201cthe generative-AI eruption\u201d that \u201cmay change our mind about how we work, how we think and what human creativity is.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s skills extend beyond conversation, of course \u2014 another likely reason for its staying power. ChatGPT can complete and debug code, compose music and essays, answer test questions, generate business ideas, write poetry and song lyrics, translate and summarize text and even emulate a computer running Linux.\n\nAn MIT study showed that, for tasks like writing cover letters, \u201cdelicate\u201d emails and cost-benefit analyses, ChatGPT decreased the amount of time it took workers to complete the tasks by 40% while increasing output quality by 18%, as measured by third-party evaluators.\n\n\u201cBecause [the AI models powering OpenAI] have been trained extensively on vast amounts of data,\u201d Shang added, \u201cthey [have] shifted focus from training specialized chatbots for specific domains to creating more general-purpose systems that can handle a variety of topics easily through prompting with instructions \u2026 [Chatbots like ChatGPT] don\u2019t require users to learn any new form of language, as long as they provide a task and some desired output just like how a manager would communicate to an intern.\u201d\n\nNow, there\u2019s mixed evidence as to whether ChatGPT is actually being used in these ways. A Pew Research survey from August showed that only 18% of Americans have ever tried ChatGPT, and that most who\u2019ve tried it use the chatbot for entertainment purposes or answering one-off questions. Teens might not be using ChatGPT all that often, either (despite what some alarmist headlines imply), with one poll finding that only two in five teenagers have used the tech in the last six months.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s limitations might be to blame.\n\nWhile undeniably capable, ChatGPT is far from perfect, owing to the way it was developed and \u201ctaught.\u201d Trained to predict the likeliest next word \u2014 or likeliest next parts of words \u2014 by observing billions of examples of text from around the web, ChatGPT sometimes \u201challucinates,\u201d or writes answers that sound plausible but aren\u2019t factually correct. (ChatGPT\u2019s hallucinating tendencies got its answers banned from the Q&A site Stack Overflow and from at least one academic conference \u2014 and accused of defamation.) ChatGPT can also show bias in its responses, answering in sexist and racist, overtly Anglocentric ways \u2014 or regurgitating portions of the data that it was trained on.\n\nLawyers have been sanctioned after using ChatGPT to assist in writing motions, discovering \u2014 too late \u2014 that ChatGPT invented fake lawsuit citations. And scores of authors have sued OpenAI over the chatbot regurgitating portions of their work \u2014 and not receiving compensation for it.\n\nSo what comes next? What might ChatGPT\u2019s second year hold, if not more of the same?\n\nInterestingly \u2014 and fortunately \u2014 some of the more dire predictions about ChatGPT didn\u2019t come to pass. Some researchers feared the chatbot would be used to generate disinformation on a massive scale, while others sounded the alarm over ChatGPT\u2019s phishing email-, spam- and malware-generating potential.\n\nThe concerns pushed policymakers in Europe to mandate security assessments for any products using generative AI systems like ChatGPT, and over 20,000 signatories \u2014 including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak \u2014 to sign an open letter calling for the immediate pause of large-scale AI experiments like ChatGPT.\n\nBut examples of ChatGPT abuse in the wild have been few and far between \u2014 so far.\n\nWith the launch of GPTs, OpenAI\u2019s tool for building custom conversational, action-taking AI systems powered by OpenAI\u2019s models, including the models underpinning ChatGPT, ChatGPT could become more a gateway to a broader ecosystem of AI-powered chatbots than the end-all-be-all.\n\nWith GPTs, a user can train a model on a cookbook collection, for example, so that it can answer questions about ingredients for a specific recipe. Or they can give a model their company\u2019s proprietary codebases so that developers can check their style or generate code in line with best practices.\n\nSome of the initial GPTs \u2014 all created by OpenAI \u2014 include a Gen Z meme translator, a coloring book and sticker creator, a data visualizer, a board game explainer and a creative writing coach. Now, ChatGPT can accomplish these tasks given carefully engineered prompts and foreknowledge. But purpose-built GPTs drastically simplify things \u2014 and might just kill the cottage industry that emerged around creating and editing prompts to feed to ChatGPT.\n\nGPTs introduce a level of personalization far beyond that ChatGPT offers today, and \u2014 once OpenAI sorts out its capacity issues \u2014 I expect we\u2019ll see an explosion of creativity there. Will ChatGPT be as visible as it once was after GPTs flood the marketplace? Perhaps not. But it won\u2019t go away \u2014 it\u2019ll simply adapt and evolve, no doubt in ways not even its creators can anticipate."

    "body": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\n\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.\n\nWhat does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.\n\nWhile there is a more\u2026nefarious side to ChatGPT, it\u2019s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.\n\nPrior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.\n\nGPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nTimeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates\n\nDecember 2023\n\nOpenAI re-opens ChatGPT Plus subscriptions\n\nAfter pausing ChatGPT Plus subscriptions in November due to a \u201csurge of usage,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced they have once again enabled sign-ups. The Plus subscription includes access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nwe have re-enabled chatgpt plus subscriptions! \ud83c\udf84 thanks for your patience while we found more gpus. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 13, 2023\n\nOpenAI and Axel Springer partner up for a \u201creal-time\u201d ChatGPT news deal\n\nOpenAI has struck a new deal with Berlin-based news publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider and Politico, to \u201chelp provide people with new ways to access quality, real-time news content through our AI tools.\u201d OpenAI will train its generative AI models on the publisher\u2019s content and add recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT.\n\nStanford researchers say ChatGPT didn\u2019t cause an influx in cheating in high schools\n\nNew research from Stanford University shows that the popularization of chatbots like ChatGPT have not caused an increase in cheating across U.S. high schools. In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.\n\nChatGPT users worry the chatbot is experiencing seasonal depression\n\nStarting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels \u201clazier\u201d than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren\u2019t sure why it\u2019s happening.\n\nSome users think it plays into the \u201cwinter break hypothesis,\u201d which argues that AI is worse in December because it \u201clearned\u201d to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.\n\nwe've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) December 8, 2023\n\nJudges in the U.K. are now allowed to use ChatGPT in legal rulings\n\nThe U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties. The guidance lays out ways to responsibly use AI in the courts, including being aware of potential bias and upholding privacy.\n\nOpenAI makes repeating words \u201cforever\u201d a violation of its terms of service after Google DeepMind test\n\nFollowing an experiment by Google DeepMind researchers that led ChatGPT to repeat portions of its training data, OpenAI has flagged asking ChatGPT to repeat specific words \u201cforever\u201d as a violation of its terms of service.\n\nLawmakers in Brazil enact an ordinance written by ChatGPT\n\nCity lawmakers in Brazil enacted a piece of legislation written entirely by ChatGPT without even knowing. Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Ros\u00e1rio admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.\n\nOpenAI reportedly delays the launch of its GPT store to 2024\n\nAccording to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI\u2019s DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nChatGPTs mobile apps top 110M installs and nearly $30M in revenue\n\nAfter launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT\u2019s have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.\n\nChatGPT celebrates one-year anniversary\n\nOpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: \u201cwhat a year it\u2019s been\u2026\u201d\n\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nApple and Google avoid naming ChatGPT as their \u2018app of the year\u2019\n\nNeither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta\u2019s Threads.\n\nAn attack from researchers prompts ChatGPT to reveal training data\n\nA test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI\u2019s LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word \u201cpoem\u201d forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nChatGPT and other AI chatbots are fueling an increase in phishing emails\n\nAccording to a new report by SlashNext, there\u2019s been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.\n\nSouth Africa officials investigate if President Cyril Ramaphosa used ChatGPT to write a speech\n\nFollowing speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa\u2019s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.\n\nChatGPT Voice can be used to replace Siri\n\nNow that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses \u2014 like a much smarter version of Siri.\n\nSam Altman returns as CEO\n\nAltman\u2019s return came swiftly, with an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d announced between him and OpenAI\u2019s board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.\n\nChatGPT Voice rolls out to all free users\n\nEven if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the \u201cheadphones\u201d icon.\n\nSam Altman might return, but it\u2019s complicated\n\nThe only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.\n\n\u201cObviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they\u2019re not going to be in OpenAI,\u201d Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was \u201copen\u201d to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.\n\nConfirmation Sam Altman will not return as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\n\nA number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company\u2019s board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT\u2019s future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.\n\nSam Altman ousted as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\n\nSam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company\u2019s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board \u201cno longer has confidence in [Altman\u2019s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI \u201cwas transformative\u201d for him and \u201chopefully the world.\u201d\n\nOpenAI explores how ChatGPT can be used in the classroom\n\nOpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.\n\nOpenAI pauses new ChatGPT Plus subscriptions due to a \u201csurge of usage\u201d\n\nFollowing OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus\u2019 new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.\n\nChatGPT gets flagged as potentially unsafe for kids\n\nAn independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.\n\nOpenAI blames DDoS attack for ChatGPT outage\n\nOpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-4 Turbo\n\nOpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that\u2019s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.\n\nGPT-4 gets a fine-tuning\n\nAs opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says \u2014 largely due to technical hurdles.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT Store lets you build (and monetize) your own GPT\n\nUsers and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI\u2019s marketplace and monetize it in the future.\n\nChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users\n\nAfter being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nOpenAI launches DALL-E 3 API, new text-to-speech models\n\nDALL-E 3, OpenAI\u2019s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI\u2019s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.\n\nOpenAI promises to defend business customers against copyright claims\n\nBowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don\u2019t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nAs OpenAI\u2019s multimodal API launches broadly, research shows it\u2019s still flawed\n\nOpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.\n\nOpenAI launches API, letting developers build \u2018assistants\u2019 into their apps\n\nAt its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build \u201cagent-like experiences\u201d within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nChatGPT app revenue shows no signs of slowing, but it\u2019s not #1\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it\u2019s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like \u201cChat & Ask AI\u201d and \u201cChatOn \u2014 AI Chat Bot Assistant\u201d, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT tests the ability to upload and analyze files for Plus users\n\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.\n\nChatGPT officially gets web search\n\nOpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.\n\nOpenAI integrates DALL-E 3 into ChatGPT\n\nThe integration means users don\u2019t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.\n\nMicrosoft-affiliated research finds flaws in GPT-4\n\nA Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d \u2014 and toxicity \u2014 of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of \u201cjailbreaking\u201d prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hits record $4.58M in revenue in September\n\nOpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures \u2014 dropping from 30% to 20% in September.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet (again)\n\nOpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023\n\nChatGPT now has a voice\n\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.\n\nPoland opens an investigation against OpenAI\n\nThe Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT \u2014 accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nOpenAI unveils DALL-E 3\n\nThe upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot \u2014 receiving the results directly within the chat app.\n\nOpera GX integrates ChatGPT-powered AI\n\nPowered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.\n\nThe new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nOpenAI releases a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in the classroom\n\nOpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system\u2019s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise\n\nChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.\n\nSurvey finds relatively few American use ChatGPT\n\nRecent Pew polling suggests the language model isn\u2019t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.\n\nOpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo\n\nWith fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company\u2019s API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model\u2019s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the \u201cfeel\u201d of the model\u2019s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.\n\nOpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.\n\nFine-tuning costs:\n\nTraining: $0.008 / 1K tokens\n\nUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokens\n\nUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokens\n\nOpenAI acquires Global Illumination\n\nIn OpenAI\u2019s first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited for the impact they\u2019ll have here at OpenAI,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. \u201cThe entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018custom instructions\u2019 feature is extended to free ChatGPT users\n\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.\n\nChina requires AI apps to obtain an administrative license\n\nMultiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple\u2019s China App Store ahead of the country\u2019s latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.\n\n\u201cAs you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),\u201d Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. \u201cBased on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.\u201d\n\nJuly 2023\n\nChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil\n\nA few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.\n\nChatGPT is coming to Android\n\nChatGPT is available to \u201cpre-order\u201d for Android users.\n\nThe ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\n\nOpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\n\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\n\nThe FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI\n\nThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made \u201cfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful\u201d statements about people.\n\nTechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:\n\nThis kind of investigation doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air \u2014 the FTC doesn\u2019t look around and say \u201cThat looks suspicious.\u201d Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there\u2019s evidence the company lied about the side effects.\n\nOpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4\n\nStarting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers \u201cwith a history of successful payments\u201d can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.\n\nIn the future, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI\u2019s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.\n\nJune 2023\n\nChatGPT app can now search the web only on Bing\n\nOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.\n\nThe Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting \u201cGPT-4\u201d in the model switcher and choosing \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.\n\nMercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system\n\nU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car\u2019s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car \u201cHey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really clear what for, though.\n\nChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and Shortcuts\n\nThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.\n\nOn iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet\u2019s interface.\n\nMay 2023\n\nTexas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checked\n\nThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that \u201cno portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,\u201d or if it was, that it was checked \u201cby a human being.\u201d\n\nChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countries\n\nThe list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countries\n\nOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries \u2014 Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon! \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023\n\nOpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS\n\nChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.\n\nWhen using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices \u2014 meaning it will know what you\u2019ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.\n\nHackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook\n\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\n\nApril 2023\n\nChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation\n\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\n\nOpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT Business\n\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\n\nOpenAI wants to trademark \u201cGPT\u201d\n\nOpenAI applied for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\n\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\n\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\n\nAuto-GPT is Silicon Valley\u2019s latest quest to automate everything\n\nAuto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\n\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\n\nFTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could \u2018turbocharge\u2019 fraud\n\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.\n\n\u201cAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,\u201d Khan told the House representatives. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We\u2019ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,\u201d she stated.\n\nSuperchat\u2019s new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT\n\nThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\n\nItaly gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\n\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\n\nResearchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic\n\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\n\nThe research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\n\nY Combinator-backed startups are trying to build \u2018ChatGPT for X\u2019\n\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\n\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\n\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\n\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\n\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\n\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\n\nItaly orders ChatGPT to be blocked\n\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it\u2019s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.\n\nMarch 2023\n\n1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all \u2018AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months\u2019\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\n\nOpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet\n\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot\u2019s functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.\n\nOpenAI launches GPT-4, available through ChatGPT Plus\n\nGPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.\n\nChatGPT is available in Azure OpenAI service\n\nChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft\u2019s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be \u201cMicrosoft managed customers and partners,\u201d can apply here for special access.\n\nOpenAI launches an API for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\n\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\n\nOther companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord \u2014 putting the pressure on Big Tech\u2019s AI initiatives, like Google.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Plus, starting at $20 per month\n\nAfter ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for \u201cChatGPT Professional\u201d as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nOpenAI teases ChatGPT Professional\n\nOpenAI said that it\u2019s \u201cstarting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT\u201d in an announcement on the company\u2019s official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no \u201cblackout\u201d windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT \u2014 \u201cat least 2x the regular daily limit.\u201d\n\nDecember 2022\n\nShareGPT lets you easily share your ChatGPT conversations\n\nA week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers \u2014 Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston \u2014 made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI\u2019s answers with the world.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5\n\nGPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that\u2019s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\n\nMuch like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been \u201clearning\u201d for a longer period of time than Bard.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\n\nThe Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind\u2019s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.\n\nApple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT,\u201d but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWho owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?\n\nThe user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."

    "body": "A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs From major layoffs at Google, Amazon and Microsoft to small fintech startups and apps\n\nLast year\u2019s techwide reckoning continues. The tech industry has seen more than 240,000 jobs lost in 2023, a total that\u2019s already 50% higher than last year and growing. Earlier this year, mass workforce reductions were driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups across many sectors also announced cutbacks through the first half of the year. And while tech layoffs slowed down in the summer and fall, it appears that cuts are ramping up yet again.\n\nMany economists have cautioned against fears of a recession, which would seem like a reason for optimism. But the momentum for a tech sector rebound has been slow to build, resulting in tech companies continuing to cut back on their workforces and pivot from a growth mindset to one based on efficiency in the face of stubborn market conditions.\n\nBut tracking these layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder of the deeply human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles could evolve from here.\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.\n\nThe running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 224,503, according to Layoffs.fyi.

    "body": "This was a year of upheaval in video games. The industry has shapeshifted over the past 12 months, and it\u2019s not all due to Microsoft\u2019s lengthy acquisition of Activision, Blizzard and King. While Xbox executives were defending the legality of a $69 billion deal that would create the third-largest video game studio in the world, smaller companies were firing staff and shutting down entire teams, even amid fervent collective-bargaining efforts. It\u2019s been a wild ride.\n\nIn 2023, the main factors molding the video game landscape were consolidation, layoffs and unionization, with each of these phenomena feeding into each other. This past year, the video game industry shrank, even as it grew financially.\n\nConsolidation\n\nWhen Microsoft's purchase of Activision-Blizzard-King was finally approved on October 12, 2023 after nearly two years of regulatory hurdles, it became the world\u2019s third-largest video game studio by revenue. As the owner of the Xbox ecosystem, Microsoft was already a massive player in video games, but purchasing a tentpole AAA studio solidified its position in the top three. Activision and Blizzard are the owners of Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Starcraft, but the real meat of this deal comes from King, the mobile division. King operates Candy Crush Saga, a game with 238 million monthly active users, which is more than twice as many as Activision Blizzard\u2019s combined player bases. Candy Crush Saga has generated more than $20 billion in lifetime revenue, and King routinely outperforms Activision and Blizzard in terms of quarterly returns. Mobile gaming remains a huge business, especially in the Chinese market, which represents the largest and most lucrative audience in video games.\n\nThough the $69 billion Activision deal was the biggest in Microsoft\u2019s history \u2014 that would be its $26 purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s first video game acquisition. Microsoft owns nearly 40 developers and it bought a chunk of those in the past five years. The Xbox umbrella covers 343 industries, Arkane Studios, Bethesda, Compulsion Games, Double Fine Productions, id Software, Infinity Ward, Mojang Studios, Ninja Theory, Playground Games, Tango Gameworks and Turn 10, among dozens more.\n\nCharley Gallay via Getty Images\n\nWith these studios at its back, Microsoft is leaning hard into cloud gaming while attempting to build a device-agnostic ecosystem powered by the Xbox brand. These moves are designed to unlock the mobile market even more, putting Xbox games on all devices, everywhere, all the time.\n\nStill, Sony is bigger than Microsoft by revenue. Though Microsoft is often the face of the game-studio acquisition spree, Sony is the owner of 21 development teams, including Bungie, Guerrilla Games, Haven Studios, Housemarque, Insomniac Games, Media Molecule, Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch Productions. Sony has been subtly expanding its roster \u2014 more subtly than Microsoft, at least \u2014 over the past three years, and it\u2019s also made heavy investments in studios like Epic Games and FromSoftware.\n\nWith this lineup, Sony is betting heavily on ongoing games, and it has 12 live-service titles in production right now, on top of Bungie\u2019s Destiny franchise. These include Haven\u2019s Fairgame$ and a multiplayer Horizon title from Guerilla.\n\n\u201cBy expanding to PC and mobile, and\u2026 also to live services, we have the opportunity to move from a situation of being present in a very narrow segment of the overall gaming software market, to being present pretty much everywhere,\" Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan said in 2022.\n\nFor the companies at the top, total domination is the goal.\n\nEven still, Tencent is bigger than both Sony and Microsoft. Tencent is not a console manufacturer, so it isn\u2019t a household name among most players, but it\u2019s one of the largest companies in the world, and it wields a ridiculous amount of financial power in video games. Tencent owns a portion of Bloober Team, Bohemia Interactive, Don\u2019t Nod, Epic, Paradox Interactive, PlatinumGames, Remedy Entertainment, Roblox and Ubisoft, among others. It has a majority stake in Supercell, Grinding Gear Games, Klei Entertainment, Tequila Works, Techland, Yager Development and others. It fully owns Riot Games, Funcom, Sharkmob, Turtle Rock Studios, and, of course, others. It also runs multiple internal development companies, including the Level Infinite and Tencent Games publishing labels.\n\nXinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nSure, Sony has a stake in Epic, but Tencent\u2019s is bigger. This investment alone means any time you buy a game built on Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine, Tencent (and Sony) is getting a cut. Tencent is the biggest investor in games, with thousands of tendrils across the industry \u2014 if you played something this year, Tencent was probably involved.\n\nOn a smaller scale, companies like Netflix and Devolver Digital have also dabbled in acquisitions recently. Devolver started buying studios in 2020, and it now owns Croteam, Dodge Roll, Doinksoft, Firefly Studios, Nerial and System Era Softworks. Annapurna Interactive bought South African studio 24 Bit Games in November. Netflix launched its Games division in 2021, and it\u2019s already purchased four studios, including Oxenfree developer Night School and Alphabear company Spry Fox.\n\nNight School co-founder Sean Krankel told Engadget in June that the move to Netflix was a boon for the studio, providing financial security, a dedicated working space and plenty of marketing support for its projects.\n\n\u201cA small subset of teams are good to go for the next 10 years, but others have these peaks and valleys, and we were somewhere in between,\u201d Krankel said. \u201cWe weren't in danger of anything going sideways. But we were at a spot where we're like, it would be cool to tether to somebody who has a similar vision, and somebody that we could work with that would like, de-risk us.\u201d\n\nNetflix\n\nThis is the short-term benefit of being bought by a larger company, but there are downsides to relinquishing independence. Having a corporate overseer can result in rigid production timelines, hindering a studio\u2019s ability to pivot, and despite all of the promises otherwise, developers may be forced to adhere to a specific tone, vibe or game-development structure. Owned studios are held accountable by people outside of the actual development of a game, and the bigger the company, the further away its bosses are from the creative process.\n\nThe most extreme negative outcomes for an acquired indie studio are, of course, layoffs and closures. We saw a lot of these in 2023.\n\nLayoffs\n\nThe post-acquisition power dynamic is playing out in public and in real-time. It\u2019s estimated that more than 9,000 people in video games were laid off this year and the firings affected teams of all sizes. This is a crisis amount of cuts. In 2022, just 1,000 video game jobs were lost, according to layoffstracker.com.\n\nThe Embracer Group provides the clearest example of rampant, surprise layoffs in 2023. Embracer has spent the past few years acquiring prominent midsize studios, including Gearbox Software (Borderlands), Crystal Dynamics (Tomb Raider), Eidos-Montreal (Deus Ex) and Square Enix Montreal (Deus Ex Go). In the past decade, Embracer grew its portfolio to cover more than 100 game studios, including Volition (Saints Row), Coffee Stain (Goat Simulator), Free Radical Design (TimeSplitters) and Zen Studios (Pinball FX). The holding company also secured the rights to The Lord of the Rings in 2022, promising to turn it into \u201cone of the biggest gaming franchises in the world.\u201d\n\nVolition\n\nIn June 2023, Embracer announced a six-year, $2 billion funding deal had fallen through, and it was going to restructure \u2014 meaning, layoffs and studio closures. Since this announcement, Embracer has shut down Volition, Free Radical Design and Campfire Cabal, it divested Goose Byte and it\u2019s fired developers at Saber Interactive. More than 900 people lost their jobs during these moves. Meanwhile, Embracer\u2019s share price rose by 11 points in November.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only layoff round of the year. Unity lowered its headcount three times in 2023, affecting about 900 jobs. In its quarterly financial results in November, Unity reported a yearly revenue increase of 69 percent and it told investors, \u201cWe continued to manage costs well.\u201d\n\nSony cut 100 jobs at Bungie, a company it bought for $3.6 billion in 2022. According to developers that are still there, Sony executives are attempting to use this upheaval to wrest more control of the studio from Bungie founders and leaders.\n\nEpic Games fired roughly 830 people this year, or 16 percent of its staff. This included significant job cuts at Mediatonic, the studio behind Fall Guys that Epic purchased in 2021.\n\nMediatonic\n\n\u201cFor a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn,\u201d CEO Tim Sweeney wrote about the layoffs. He continued, \u201cI had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.\u201d\n\nElectronic Arts was one of the first video game companies to institute significant layoffs this year, with a reduction of 6 percent of its workforce, or about 800 employees, in March. EA later cut jobs at Dirt and F1 studio Codemasters, which it purchased in 2021 for $1.2 billion. EA culled an estimated 1,130 jobs in 2023.\n\nCD Projekt RED and Sega each laid off about 100 people in the past 12 months, while Ubisoft fired an estimated 255 employees. Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs across its businesses early in the year, and that included about 100 people at Halo studio 343 industries.\n\n343 industries\n\nThese are just some of the biggest names in layoffs in 2023. Looking back on the carnage, it feels like a warning \u2014 as consolidation efforts increase, more game studios will be controlled by just a handful of companies, and they\u2019ll be vulnerable to moves like mass layoffs and closures. We\u2019re laying the foundation for the future of video games right now, and consolidation only makes the industry smaller and more generic, as accountants, investors and shareholders push for low-risk concepts, rather than innovation and change.\n\nWhat will rampant consolidation mean for all of these acquired studios in five years\u2019 time? What will it mean when these teams aren\u2019t shiny, new investments any longer, and the people at the top are ready to get lean again? Remember that many of the shuttered studios listed above were purchased within the past three years.\n\nBeing acquired is a cost-benefit analysis for smaller studios, where the benefits are immediate and the costs are potential. It\u2019s easy to say that won\u2019t happen to us. But it can happen, and it does, and as consolidation increases, bulk layoffs are only going to occur more often.\n\nUnions\n\nUnionization is one approach that can help protect the livelihoods of people in the video game industry, and there was progress on this front in 2023. Developers at multiple studios now have union support, from small indies to AAA powerhouses.\n\nMicrosoft is currently the home of the industry\u2019s largest union, with representation for more than 300 quality assurance workers at ZeniMax Media. ZeniMax is the parent company of Bethesda, id Software and Arkane, and Microsoft purchased the whole caboodle for $7.5 billion in 2021. Microsoft formally recognized the ZeniMax union this January and the parties started negotiating in April. In December, Microsoft announced it would hire 77 contract workers as full-time employees under the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union. The deal guaranteed a pay raise, paid holidays and sick leave, and a copy of Starfield, the game they helped ship.\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\n\u201cWe are now stronger at the bargaining table and are working to secure a fair contract for all workers \u2014 direct employees and contractors,\" ZeniMax union member Chris Lusco said. \"We are all a part of ZeniMax Studio\u2019s success and we all deserve our fair share. We hope to set a new precedent for workers across Microsoft and the entire gaming industry so that all workers, regardless of their employment status, are able to improve their working conditions through collective bargaining.\"\n\nMeanwhile, executives at Microsoft\u2019s newest acquisition, Activision Blizzard, spent the past few years stalling internal unionization efforts. However, QA employees at Raven Software, a subsidiary of Activision, successfully voted to unionize in May 2022. Microsoft has vowed to respect organization attempts now that Activision-Blizzard-King is under its control.\n\nOther companies with unions established in the past two years include Avalanche Studios, Anemone Hug, CD Projekt RED, Experis Game Solutions, Keywords Studios, Sega of America, Tender Claws and Workinman Interactive."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIn her forthcoming memoir, The Woman in Me, Britney Spears is expected to reflect on some of the most pivotal moments in her life, including her relationships.\n\nOver the years, the pop star\u2019s love life has continued to make headlines. Most recently, her ex-husband Sam Asghari filed for divorce after only 14 months of marriage. Spears is also the mother of two children \u2013 Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17 \u2013 who she shares with her second ex-husband, Kevin Federline.\n\nAccording to a press release for The Woman in Me, Spears\u2019 memoir is \u201ca brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith, and hope\u201d. Spears\u2019 book is also expected to cover the high-profile legal battle to end her conservatorship, which was dissolved in November 2021 after 13 years.\n\nThroughout her time in the spotlight, specifically during the \u201890s and 2000s, Spears has been in some heavily publicised romances. Unsurprisingly, fans are anticipating that Spears will detail some of her relationships in The Woman in Me, which is set for release on 24 October.\n\nFrom Justin Timberlake to her now ex-husband Sam Asghari, here\u2019s everything we know about Britney Spears\u2019 relationships and rumoured romances.\n\nJustin Timberlake: 1998 to 2002\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nSpears\u2019 first highly public relationship was with her co-star in the Mickey Mouse Club, Justin Timberlake. The pair made many appearances together while dating, including the iconic moment Spears and Timberlake wore matching, all-denim outfits to the American Music Awards in 2001.\n\nThey broke up in 2002, shortly after Timberlake and his boy band NSYNC released their hit tune, \u201cCry Me a River\u201d. At the time, the music video for the song \u2013 which featured a woman with blonde hair - sparked rumours that he and Spears broke up because she allegedly cheated on him.\n\nAlthough the former couple never acknowledged the breakup rumours, the 2021 Framing Britney documentary addressed some of the public scrutiny that Spears faced during the 2000s. Following the documentary\u2019s release, Timberlake came under criticism for the way he acted following his breakup with Spears.\n\nHe later issued an apology to Spears on Instagram, writing: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.\u201d\n\nIn June 2021, he also shared his support for Spears after she testified publicly in a bid to end her conservatorship, which was controlled by her father, Jamie Spears. In a Los Angeles court hearing at the time, Spears alleged that she had been forced to take lithium against her will. She also claimed that the team managing her conservatorship had prevented her from having another baby by refusing to remove her IUD.\n\n\u201cAfter what we saw today, we should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was,\u201d Timberlake wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to her is just not right. No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.\u201d\n\nWade Robson: 2001 to 2002\n\nShortly after her breakup from Timberlake, Spears was rumoured to be dating Wade Robson, a dancer and choreographer who appeared in the music video for her 2009 tune, \u201c(You Drive Me) Crazy\u201d. However, neither Spears nor Robson confirmed these rumours.\n\nColin Farrell: 2003\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nBack in 2003, Farrell and Spears made headlines when they were spotted holding hands at the premiere of The Recruit, sparking speculation that they were dating. However, during an interview with Entertainment Tonight at the time, the actor specified that he and the singer were just friends.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a mate,\u201d Farrell told the outlet, as reported by People in 2003. \u201cSeriously, we just met a week ago, [we\u2019re] having a laugh.\u201d\n\nJason Alexander: 2004\n\nJason Alexander was Spears\u2019 first husband, tying the knot at a wedding chapel in Las Vegas in 2004. However, only 55 hours after the nuptials, they annulled the marriage.\n\nIn 2022, Alexander made headlines when he tried to attend Spears\u2019 wedding to Asghari, as could be heard saying in a video that he was going to crash the nuptials. \u201cShe\u2019s my first wife, my only wife,\u201d Alexander reportedly told security. \u201cI\u2019m her first husband, I\u2019m here to crash the wedding.\u201d\n\nAfter he was arrested for trespassing, vandalism, and battery, a security guard later revealed in court that when Alexander crashed the wedding, he also tried to enter Spears\u2019 bedroom.\n\nKevin Federline: 2004 to 2007\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nKevin Federline and the \u201cGimme More\u201d singer first met at a club in 2004, before they went on to start their relationship. After just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September of that year during a surprise wedding ceremony. Weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, they welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston.\n\nIn 2006, they welcomed their second son, Jayden James. At the time, Federline was already a father to his daughter Kori Madison, now 20, and son Kaleb Michael, 18, with ex-fianc\u00e9e Shar Jackson.\n\nSpears went on to file for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d as the reason for their split. In the couple\u2019s initial divorce settlement, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children. While it appeared they were on good terms after their separation, things took a turn in 2018 when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears.\n\nAfter months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears\u2019s child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.\n\nFederline has since moved on from the relationship, as he married volleyball player Victoria Prince in 2013. They now share two daughters, Jordan, 10, and Peyton, eight.\n\nAdnan Ghalib: 2007 to 2008\n\nSpears met British paparazzo Adnan Ghalib in 2007, shortly after she decided to shave her hair off in front of approximately 70 photographers. They only dated for about a year, as the relationship ended in 2008.\n\nIn the 2021 Netflix documentary, Britney vs Spears, Ghalib spoke candidly about the romance, claiming: \u201cIt was a very simple, very easy relationship, you know? But between her fans and everybody else, it was like I was the bad guy.\u201d\n\nThe former couple split in 2008 after Ghalib reportedly pulled a pregnancy test-buying stunt for publicity. In 2009, Jamie Spears filed a restraining order against Ghalib, which ordered the photographer to stay away from the singer and her family until 2012.\n\nJason Trawick: 2009 to 2013\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nSpears and Jason Trawick, a Hollywood agent who worked at WME, started dating in 2009 before getting engaged in December 2011. However, they called off their engagement in January 2013 and announced they were going their separate ways.\n\n\"Jason and I have decided to call off our engagement. I\u2019ll always adore him and we will remain great friends,\" Spears said in a statement sent by her representative to ABC News.\n\nTrawick also issued a statement at the time, saying: \u201cAs this chapter ends for us a new one begins. I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever.\"\n\nDavid Lucado: 2013 to 2014\n\nTwo months after ending her engagement with Trawick, Spears started dating David Lucado, who worked at a legal firm. In August 2014, Spears announced their split, tweeting: \u201cAhhhh the single life!\u201d At the time, her representative also confirmed to People: \u201cYes, she\u2019s single.\u201d\n\nThe news of the breakup came asTMZ alleged that Lucado had cheated on Spears, with claims that her father had purchased a video of the infidelity incident. The publication later alleged that Lucado denied the cheating allegations, with claims that he was seeing the other woman while he and Spears were broken up.\n\nDespite their seemingly rocky history, Lucado showed his support for his ex in a 2016 interview with theNew York Times about her conservatorship. Speaking to the publication, he said: \u201cIf anyone knew the real Britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is.\u201d\n\nThe publication also noted that Lucado denied the infidelity claims from Spears\u2019 father, before he added: \u201cAnd if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over Britney\u2019s personal life.\u201d\n\nCharlie Ebersol: 2014 to 2015\n\nSpears and Charlie Ebersol, who is known as the co-founder of Tempus Ex Machina and The Company, started dating in 2014. While their relationship was fairly low profile, Spears previously opened up about why she was drawn to Ebersol in the first place.\n\n\u201cThere was something about him that made me feel really peaceful and at ease. And he was really hot, too. Adorably hot,\u201d she told People at the time.\n\nThey officially broke up in June 2015 after eight months of dating.\n\nSam Asghari: 2016 to 2023\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nThe pair first met in 2016 when Asghari was cast as Spears\u2019 love interest in the music video for her song, \u201cSlumber Party\u201d, from her 2016 album Glory. They made their relationship Instagram official in 2017 and went on to support each other through different milestones - including the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards, where Spears accepted the Vanguard Award for her work promoting equality and acceptance.\n\nIn April 2022, Spears announced she was pregnant with her and Asghari\u2019s first child together, and her third child. However, the following month, she said in a statement posted to Instagram that she had suffered a miscarriage. The couple wrote: \u201cWe have lost our miracle baby.\u201d\n\nThat June, they held their lavish nuptials at her home in California with a star-studded guest list, which included Selena Gomez, Paris Hilton, Drew Barrymore, and Donatella Versace - who designed Spears\u2019 wedding dress.\n\nIn August, months after Asghari shut down speculation about getting a divorce, TMZ claimed that he had confronted Spears about rumours she cheated on him. That same day, the fitness instructor officially filed for divorce, listing the date of separation as 28 July 2023 and citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split.\n\nIn a statement posted online, Asghari said: \u201cAfter six years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together. We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. S*** happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including the media to be kind and thoughtful.\u201d\n\nDays before Spears\u2019 memoir release date, Asghari revealed that he had obtained an early copy of the book. In an interview with TMZ on 13 October, he explained that he wasn\u2019t worried about anything being written in the book that could paint him in a negative light.\n\n\u201cI already read it and I\u2019m very proud of her,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cShe put a lot of work into it, and it was very hard. I\u2019m definitely excited, and I\u2019m extremely proud of her. It was a very tough one [to write].\u201d\n\nThe Woman in Me is due for release on 24 October in the US and UK."

    "body": "She has never really known freedom\n\nAs a child, Britney escaped her difficult home life \u2013 her alcoholic father often rowing with her mother \u2013 into the outdoors, which \u201cgave me a sense of aliveness and danger\u201d, she writes. Performing also makes her feel invincible. But by the age of 16, she is public property \u2013 incapable of going outside without being mobbed, and her love of singing and dancing now a lucrative resource.\n\nBy the time of her second album, she wants for so little: skinny-dipping with her dancers after playing Rock in Rio in January 2001 is one of her happiest memories. \u201cIt was a taste of rebellion and freedom, but I was just having fun and being a 19-year-old,\u201d she writes. After her split from Justin Timberlake, she dreams about quitting pop and opening a shop: \u201cWith the gift of hindsight I can see that I hadn\u2019t given myself enough time to heal from the breakup,\u201d she writes \u2013 though her requests for a break are not only turned down, but interpreted as a potential sign of sedition to be quashed and interrogated.\n\nIn this restrictive environment, small kindnesses take on an outsized significance, like Paris Hilton encouraging her \u201cto have fun for the first time in a long time\u201d, leading to some infamous nights out with the heiress and Lindsay Lohan. Once again, Britney is seen as stepping out of bounds, potentially damaging her earning potential. One night she has her mother babysit her sons; when she returns home tipsy, Lynne Spears screams at her, she writes. \u201cThe shame I felt killed my heart. I stood there, reeling, and thought, OK, I guess it\u2019s forbidden for me to party.\u201d As the restrictions get tighter, Britney acts out \u2013 and ends up legally denied her freedom for 13 years, under a conservatorship controlled by her father.\n\nHer body felt like public property\n\nFrom day one, Britney\u2019s body is made fair game. Between the videos for her debut single, Baby, One More Time and Sometimes, the media noted her changing physique and concluded that the 16-year-old must have had breast implants \u2013 rather than simply going through puberty. She notices that talkshow hosts ask her about her chest, while her boyfriend Justin Timberlake gets asked serious questions about his music. It\u2019s one of many pressures that ultimately push her to breaking point, and when she writes about shaving her head in a salon in 2007, she frames it as a \u201cfuck you\u201d to the impossible beauty standards she felt forced to live up to: \u201cI\u2019d smiled politely while TV show hosts leered at my breasts, while American parents said I was destroying their children by wearing a crop top.\u201d\n\nThat brief moment of freedom doesn\u2019t last long: a year later, she is ambushed into the conservatorship, which also exercises jurisdiction over her body. \u201cNo matter how much I dieted and exercised, my father was always telling me I was fat,\u201d she writes. Punishing gym routines leave her feeling \u201cout of my mind\u201d. Her diet is monitored \u2013 along with every other detail of her life \u2013 while she goes through the motions of her Las Vegas residency. \u201cMy body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.\u201d\n\nHere I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body\n\nOn the other side of the conservatorship, she writes, freedom looks like being able to gain weight without anyone \u201cshouting at me\u201d. It\u2019s eating chocolate again. It\u2019s posting selfies \u2013 either nude or clothed \u2013 on Instagram. Some people don\u2019t understand the latter, she writes, \u201cbut I think if they\u2019d been photographed by other people thousands of times, prodded and posed for other people\u2019s approval, they\u2019d understand that I get a lot of joy from posing the way I feel sexy and taking my own picture, doing whatever I want with it.\u201d\n\nHer \u2018virginity\u2019 was a prison\n\nBritney was actively marketed as a virgin, a repulsive, archaic premise that made the 16-year-old\u2019s inevitable sexuality into a kind of timebomb. In fact, she writes happily, she first slept with her older brother\u2019s best friend when she was 14. Yet the fixation on her \u201cpurity\u201d took \u201cthe focus off me as a musician and a performer\u201d, she writes. \u201cAll some reporters could think of to ask me was whether or not my breasts were real (they were, actually) and whether or not my hymen was intact.\u201d\n\nBritney Spears and Justin Timberlake in 2002. Photograph: Tom Mihalek/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen Timberlake tells the world that she cheated on him, she is all but emblazoned with a scarlet letter. While she knows she is powerless against that narrative (\u201cI don\u2019t think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don\u2019t think he understands to this day\u201d), him telling the world that they had a sexual relationship was liberating. \u201cTo be honest with you, I liked that Justin said that,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhy did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my 20s? Whose business was it if I\u2019d had sex or not?\u201d\n\nBut she still couldn\u2019t escape the cycle that Timberlake set in motion: she describes her 2004 Onyx Hotel tour in the aftermath as \u201ctoo sexual, for a start. Justin had embarrassed me publicly, so my rebuttal onstage was to kind of go there a little bit, too. But it was absolutely horrible.\u201d\n\nShe has an immaculate sense of shade\n\nBritney seems too pure of heart for active malice, but she has an immaculate way with a piercing characterisation. Timberlake\u2019s band, \u2018NSync, were big hip-hop heads, she writes, and sometimes \u201ctried too hard to fit in\u201d with Black artists. When Timberlake spots Ginuwine at an event, he \u201cgot all excited and said, so loud, \u2018Oh yeah fo shiz, fo shiz! Ginuwiiiine! What\u2019s up, homie!\u2019\u201d\n\nHer account of being encouraged to abort their pregnancy at home, lest anyone see them going in and out of hospital, is horrifying. Britney, with no pain relief, is writhing on the floor. Timberlake proves to be the last person you\u2019d call in a crisis. \u201cAt some point he thought maybe music would help, so he got his guitar and he lay there with me, strumming it,\u201d she writes. Almost as embarrassing is husband Kevin Federline\u2019s attempt to start a music career. \u201cHe really thought he was a rapper now,\u201d she writes, with the bafflement of someone who has never known pretension. \u201cBless his heart \u2013 because he did take it so seriously.\u201d\n\nMotherhood leaves her vulnerable\n\nWhen Britney gets pregnant with her first son, she initially thinks it might protect her: \u201cI wanted everyone to stay away: stand back! There\u2019s a baby here!\u201d Inevitably, it doesn\u2019t work out that way. The paparazzi become aggressive, particularly once she has her kids in quick succession \u2013 becoming pregnant a second time three months after giving birth to her first. She suffers from postnatal depression and feels hopeless about her ability to protect her sons: \u201cI got a little depressed once I was no longer keeping them safe inside my body \u2026 I wanted them back inside me so the world couldn\u2019t get at them.\u201d\n\nEvery part of normal life had been stripped from me. I had no freedom and yet also no security\n\nShe has a keen sense of injustice regarding a perceived contract that she never signed with the public and the press. \u201cThey just kept acting like I owed it to them to let the men who kept trying to catch me looking fat take photos of my infant sons.\u201d Her postpartum body and shots of her without makeup were treated as \u201csome kind of a sin \u2013 as if gaining weight was something unkind I\u2019d done to them personally, a betrayal. At what point did I promise to stay 17 for the rest of my life?\u201d\n\nWhat she knows now, she writes, \u201cis that every part of normal life had been stripped from me \u2013 going out in public without becoming a headline, making normal mistakes as a new mother of two babies, feeling like I could trust the people around me. I had no freedom and yet also no security. At the time I was also suffering, I now know, from severe postpartum depression.\u201d It left her suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it, I felt that I couldn\u2019t live if things didn\u2019t get better.\u201d\n\nShe knows she is trapped in a state of arrested development\n\nIt\u2019s often said that famous people are frozen in time at the age they became famous, but Britney was never allowed to be a real child, nor a real adult. Her 2001 single I\u2019m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman may be her most prescient recording; she is painfully conscious of this divide. After her split from Timberlake, she likens herself to Benjamin Button. \u201cSomehow that year, in becoming more vulnerable I started to feel like a child again.\u201d\n\nThe situation worsens amid postnatal depression. \u201cIt was as if some part of me became the baby,\u201d she writes in an apologetic section about transferring her frustrations on to her interior decorator. \u201cOne part of me was a very demanding grown woman yelling about white marble, while another part of me was suddenly very childlike.\u201d\n\nWhen she is placed under the conservatorship, she not only regresses, but feels dehumanised by the constant scrutiny. \u201cI became a robot. But not just a robot \u2013 a sort of child-robot. The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.\u201d It\u2019s hard to explain, she says, \u201chow quickly I could vacillate between being a little girl and being a teenager and being a woman, because of the way they had robbed me of my freedom \u2026 They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time.\u201d\n\nMusic seems to have become an afterthought\n\nEarly on, Britney writes, she loved making music. She told the producer Max Martin that she wanted to sound more R&B than straight pop; she listened to Tainted Love the night before recording Baby, One More Time and stayed up late so that she would sound as gravelly and \u201cfried\u201d as Marc Almond. She was a studio perfectionist who would stay in the booth for hours, and the school setting and uniforms of the Baby video were her idea. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the moment in my life when I had the most passion for music,\u201d she writes. \u201cI was unknown and I had nothing to lose if I messed up.\u201d\n\nAfter that, her music barely gets a mention in A Woman Like Me. There\u2019s a nod to her breaking records; the era-defining Toxic is dispensed with in a sentence. The only album that she goes into any kind of detail on is 2007\u2019s cult favourite Blackout, made at the height of her public struggles yet full of potential. The studio was a refuge from the paparazzi hounding her outside; making a messy DIY video for the single Gimme More may be \u201cby far the worst video I\u2019ve ever shot in my life\u201d, but the scrappiness meant \u201cmore interesting people started noticing and wanting to work with me\u201d. There\u2019s some later love for 2016\u2019s Glory, and she writes proudly about her 2022 collaboration with Elton John, but says she has no plans to make music at the moment.\n\nHer life under the conservatorship is a horror story\n\nIt feels fitting that The Woman in Me is being released a week before Halloween. No matter how much we already know about the 13 years that Britney lived under a conservatorship, her recounting of its imposition, life under it and her inability to escape it is nothing short of a horror story. It is appalling, like something out of a Victorian novel, not the very real experiences of a thirtysomething in the last decade.\n\nWhen she fears that Federline is going to take away access to her kids, she locks herself in a bathroom with one of her sons. \u201cBefore I knew what was happening, a Swat team in black suits burst through the bathroom door as if I\u2019d hurt someone,\u201d she writes, and she is subject to a forced hospital hold. Soon after, her mother invites her to her beach house because \u201cthe cops are after you\u201d. When she arrives, so does another Swat team. \u201cI\u2019m a five-foot four-inch pop singer who calls everyone sir and ma\u2019am,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey treated me like I was a criminal or predator.\u201d\n\nThe conservatorship clamps down on her life, ruled by her father, who she alleges was \u201can alcoholic, someone who\u2019d declared bankruptcy, who\u2019d failed in business, who\u2019d terrified me as a little girl\u201d. She is medicated and surveilled. Her dates are required to agree to background checks and blood tests, made to sign NDAs, and receive a full rundown of her sexual history before the first date. \u201cThe insanity of this system kept me from finding basic companionship, having a fun night out or making new friends \u2013 let alone falling in love,\u201d Britney writes. \u201cIt was just the worst thing that could possibly ever happen to my music, my career and my sanity.\u201d\n\nShe accedes in order to retain access to her boys, but questions how she can perform at such a high level when she is perceived as \u201cso sick that I couldn\u2019t make my own decisions\u201d. She makes futile attempts to escape the arrangement; meanwhile her father sends her to rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous because she has been taking over-the-counter energy supplements. The women at AA inspire her to start trying to take control over her life but she just hits more walls. Her father won\u2019t let her remove her IUD to start a family with her new boyfriend, later husband, Sam Ashgari (they have divorced since Britney completed the memoir). After she objects to a new dance move suggested for her Vegas residency, she is sent to a solitary rehabilitation facility for two months, the most upsetting part of the book.\n\nWas I a bank robber? A wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?\n\nShe is locked up, put on lithium, subject to relentless testing and mandatory therapy, can\u2019t see her kids or dog, can\u2019t bathe or dress in private or shut the door to her room, has set bed and waking times. For blood tests, \u201cthe tech drawing my blood would be flanked by the nurse, a security guard and my assistant. Was I a cannibal? Was I a bank robber? Was I a wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?\u201d She wonders if her family is trying to kill her. Made slow and sclerotic, \u201cI began to feel like I was being ritually tortured,\u201d she writes, feeling estranged from her own body. \u201cIf the idea of my being in that place was to heal, that was not the effect.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not scared of anything after that experience, she writes, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t make me feel strong; it makes me sad. I shouldn\u2019t be this strong.\u201d\n\n#FreeBritney protesters in 2021. Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA\n\nA nurse shows Britney the blossoming fan movement that is spreading awareness of its suspicions that all is not right with her conservatorship. Come June 2021, she calls 911 to report her father for conservatorship abuse days before a probate court hearing on the arrangement. \u201cMy voice had been used for me and against me so many times that I was afraid nobody would recognise it now if I spoke freely,\u201d she writes. When she is granted her freedom in November 2021, she says she feels shock, relief, elation, sadness and joy.\n\nThere is no love lost for her family\n\nBritney writes about how she was always made to feel she was not enough as a kid; her father\u2019s alleged alcoholism, neglect and brutal standards; how her mother always made her feel less-than. She is unsparing about her younger sister, who she characterises as a brat who was spared the pain of Britney\u2019s impoverished childhood because of her success. \u201cMy mom and I had to witness the ugliness and the violence without believing that there was anywhere else to go.\u201d\n\nEven once Britney is the biggest pop star in the world, her parents still seem to have an undue say in the running of her career, including making her sit for humiliating TV interviews \u2013 why exactly that is remains unanswered. Her father seizes control legally with the imposition of the conservatorship, telling her, chillingly, \u201cI am Britney Spears now,\u201d and her family appear to live off her dime while she lives an extraordinarily restricted life.\n\nWhen she returns home from the forced stint in a brutal rehab facility, she finds that her parents have thrown away her childhood things, including a binder full of her poetry. \u201cI felt an overwhelming sadness. I thought of the pages I\u2019d written through tears. I never wanted to publish them or anything like that, but they were important to me. And my family had thrown them in the trash, just like they\u2019d thrown me away.\u201d She resolves to start over with a new notebook. \u201cIn that moment I made peace with my family,\u201d she writes. \u201cBy which I mean that I realised I never wanted to see them again, and I was at peace with that.\u201d\n\nBritney writes that she is working to feel \u201cmore compassion than anger\u201d towards them. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d"

    "body": "It is honestly kind of incredible to watch a man torpedo his own credibility on direct testimony. We\u2019re not even at the cross yet, and the judge has already instructed him to answer the question he\u2019s being asked by his own lawyer.\n\nThe jury is watching all of this intently.\n\nThe main thing that\u2019s been clear so far from Bankman-Fried\u2019s testimony is that the man really loves the sound of his own voice. So far, the count of \u201cObjection, narrative!\u201d to Bankman-Fried\u2019s answers, followed by \u201cSustained\u201d is at three.\n\nAlso, sometimes when Bankman-Fried says \u201cwe,\u201d he only means himself.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been found guilty on seven counts including charges of wire fraud. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\nYesterday, during an evidentiary hearing, Bankman-Fried was repeatedly scolded by Judge Lewis Kaplan for not answering prosecutor Danielle Sassoon\u2019s questions on cross-examination. Today, Bankman-Fried was scolded by Kaplan for not answering his counsel Mark Cohen\u2019s questions on direct examination. Bankman-Fried has also occasionally interrupted Cohen with \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cyup.\u201d\n\nWe spent a lot of the morning explaining vocabulary. I will spare you the full list, though I will say that explaining \u201cAmazon Web Services\u201d and \u201cdatabase\u201d was a bit too detail-oriented. Then Bankman-Fried tried to define \u201cmarket manipulation.\u201d After Bankman-Fried gave his definition, Kaplan told the jury that he was the final authority on that, thanks.\n\nIn fairness to Bankman-Fried, he has been clearer and much easier to understand than he was at the evidentiary hearing yesterday. There was a minimum of word salad today. I don\u2019t know if he was more relaxed, or he\u2019d just been more rehearsed, but I will certainly be watching to see if he suddenly becomes much less coherent when Sassoon gets him for the cross.\n\nHere is the story of FTX, from his point of view.\n\nBankman-Fried, who informed us he\u2019s \u201csomewhat introverted, naturally,\u201d gave us a rather prolonged tour of his pre-Alameda Research life, which I will skip. In 2017, during a crypto bull run, he started his cryptocurrency trading firm. He knew \u201cbasically nothing\u201d about cryptocurrency at the time, he explained, but he wanted to do arbitrage on it anyway.\n\nAlameda Research was named for Alameda County in California, which was where its first office was set up. As for its name, here\u2019s what Bankman-Fried said on the stand:\n\nEffectively, we wanted to be under the radar at that point in time. I didn\u2019t want to call it Sam\u2019s Crypto Trading Firm or anything like that. We \u2014 there are a lot of competitors and people who we didn\u2019t particularly want to know what we were building out because they would race to do it. \u201cResearch\u201d was a sort of generic word, which filled out the company name. And that was \u2014 it was far better than the internal name that we had at that point, which was Wireless Mouse.\n\nI would find this much more believable if I hadn\u2019t already watched a video of Bankman-Fried explaining on a podcast that the name made it easier to get a bank account. That happened during the first day of Gary Wang\u2019s testimony. Bankman-Fried was there, too. You know who else was there? The jury.\n\nAnyway, Bankman-Fried went on a hiring spree for Alameda. He rounded up his merry gang of alleged co-conspirators. First, Wang, to program the computers. Then, Nishad Singh, about a month after founding Alameda Research. Finally, Caroline Ellison.\n\nNot having a risk team, when you are any kind of financial anything, is certainly a choice\n\nThough Bankman-Fried was the CEO, and also the majority owner, he wanted to be clear: he did not supervise Wang\u2019s direct work. Anyway, after a bunch of wildly successful arbitrage \u2014 50 percent to 100 percent annualized returns, per his testimony \u2014 he decided to found a cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. He figured he\u2019d fail; that there was only a 20 percent chance of success. Bankman-Fried did not define what he expected the time period to be on this estimate, but arguably 20 percent was a much higher chance of success than FTX would enjoy once Alameda dipped into the customer deposits.\n\nBy the way, because he was such a good guy, Bankman-Fried made a point of \u201cperiodically\u201d handling support tickets himself. \u201cI worried if I didn\u2019t, I would lose touch with the actual concerns of the customers,\u201d he testified. What he did not do was create a risk team, which he is now characterizing as a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d\n\nRisk is an inherent part of a futures exchange, which is even more like a casino than regular cryptocurrency. Not having a risk team, when you are any kind of financial anything, is certainly a choice. It is especially a choice when you go around telling everyone your crypto exchange is very good and safe.\n\nFTX\u2019s big selling point was its \u201crisk engine,\u201d which was supposed to prevent big losses that would then be spread around all the rest of the customers. But Bankman-Fried testified that in 2020, the \u201crisk engine was effectively sagging under the weight\u201d of the exchange\u2019s rapid growth. So its time to liquidation went up \u2014 it took minutes to determine which accounts needed to be liquidated. As a result, at one point the risk engine got stuck in a catastrophic feedback loop that would have created losses in the \u201ctrillions of dollars,\u201d Bankman-Fried testified. As part of that feedback loop, Alameda teetered on the brink of liquidation, which \u201cwould have disastrous consequences\u201d for FTX.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what was happening.\u201d\n\nBecause of that experience, Bankman-Fried suggested an \u201calert\u201d or \u201cdelay\u201d that would keep Alameda from being liquidated by a bug. This is the supposed origin story of \u201callow_negative,\u201d which Bankman-Fried says was the eventual result of that conversation, and that he says he didn\u2019t know about until very recently.\n\nThere is a problem with this story. \u201cAllow_negative\u201d was coded and switched on in 2019. I saw the code in court, and so did Bankman-Fried, who was also there for the testimony. Perhaps you are wondering, was the jury also there? Reader, it was.\n\nBankman-Fried denied he knew about the effectively infinite line of credit Alameda Research received from FTX. This argument was peculiar; essentially my take-away was that the CEO of a financial company simply didn\u2019t pay attention to finances.\n\nFTX couldn\u2019t get bank accounts right away. Bankman-Fried anticipated it would take a year or two. Rather than wait, he decided to use Alameda as the \u201cpayment provider\u201d for bank transfers. \u201cMy understanding at the time was that there were teams managing the process,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what was happening.\u201d\n\nWell, sure, understandable! He\u2019s an introvert!\n\nBankman-Fried definitely did not know that Singh, his employee, had backdated interest payments to get FTX \u201cover the line\u201d to $1 billion\n\nIn 2021, FTX was growing to millions of users, with $1 billion of revenue. Bankman-Fried said he worked 12 to 22 hours a day, and took one day off every couple of months. Because FTX had grown so much, he could no longer run both companies, he said. Bankman-Fried handed the company off to Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco, who immediately after being named co-CEO promptly drifted away to early retirement. (Quiet quitting king!) Bankman-Fried did remain involved in hedging and risk at Alameda, though.\n\nAbout that $1 billion of revenue in 2021: Bankman-Fried definitely did not know that Singh, his employee, had backdated interest payments to get FTX \u201cover the line\u201d to $1 billion. See, he\u2019d just asked his employees to check and see if there was any source of funds that was missing to get to $1 billion. This testimony was especially rambling.\n\nOh, also that MobileCoin loss? The one Wang said Alameda took to keep off FTX\u2019s balance sheet? Yeah, so it was a totally innocent thing where what actually happened was that Bankman-Fried thought it was appropriate that Alameda take the position as a backstop liquidity provider, that\u2019s all.\n\nIn June 2022, Bankman-Fried heard about the account called \u201cfiat@ftx\u201d tracking how much money Alameda owed to FTX, he testified. He did not know what it was and did not bother to find out. He was busy! That was when Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, because he thought Alameda was good for it. He also gave BlockFi and Voyager, two crypto lenders, some capital infusions for good measure.\n\nHe was \u201cvery surprised!\u201d\n\nRemember that testimony Adam Yedidia gave about a conversation with Bankman-Fried in August 2022 about the enormous amount of money Alameda owed FTX? Well, Bankman-Fried remembers it differently. See, Yedidia was just asking about Alameda\u2019s risk profile, and Bankman-Fried wasn\u2019t talking about insolvency at all.\n\nAlso, when Singh and Bankman-Fried had the dramatic balcony conversation at their penthouse, it was just that Singh thought Alameda\u2019s liabilities had gotten too high, and FTX was spending too much money on marketing. But Bankman-Fried still thought that Alameda had more assets than liabilities, so it was all fine, and besides, if Singh thought he was going to be better at marketing, he could take it over. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with the money Alameda owed FTX at all.\n\nOf course not! Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t learn about the $8 billion liability associated with Alameda until October 2022, he said. And he learned it all by himself, by looking at a computer database. When he found it, he was \u201cvery surprised!\u201d\n\nBesides the two obvious lies Bankman-Fried told on the stand \u2014 about Alameda Research\u2019s name and about \u201callow_negative\u201d \u2014 I have been struck by how little he seems to know about his own companies. Apparently, Singh, Wang, and Ellison were out there just doing whatever their little hearts desired. Because Bankman-Fried was a CEO, but definitely not the kind that pays any attention to money at his crypto trading firm and futures exchange."

    "body": "It has been a whirlwind four days for OpenAI, the generative AI poster child behind the smash hit ChatGPT.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, the OpenAI board ousted CEO and co-founder Sam Altman and demoted president and co-founder Greg Brockman, who subsequently resigned, paving the way for what looked like a mutiny by staff insisting the founders be reinstated post-haste. By then, Microsoft had already hired Altman and Brockman to head up a new internal AI unit, though, as things transpired, nothing had actually been signed yet, with rumors suggesting that the ousted leaders might actually return to OpenAI after all \u2014 in some capacity, at least.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and any number of potential outcomes still remain on the table. But the whole debacle has shone a spotlight on the forces that control the burgeoning AI revolution, leading many to question what happens if you go all-in on a centralized proprietary player, and what happens if things then go belly-up?\n\n\u201cThe OpenAI / Microsoft drama underlines one of the big near-term risks with AI \u2014 that this next wave of technology is controlled by the same tiny set of players who have shaped that last era of the internet,\u201d Mark Surman, president and executive director at the Mozilla Foundation, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe might have a chance of avoiding this if GPT-X were responsibly open sourced, giving researchers and startups a shot at making this technology safer, more useful and more trustworthy for people everywhere.\u201d\n\nOpen and shut\n\nIn an open letter published by Mozilla a few weeks back, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun joined some 70 other signatories in calling for more openness in AI development, though that letter has since garnered more than 1,700 signatures. The backdrop stems from Big Tech companies such as OpenAI and Google\u2019s DeepMind calling for more regulation, warning of catastrophic consequences if the AI levers were to meet the wrong hands \u2014 in other words, they argued that proprietary AI is safer than open source.\n\nLeCun et al. disagree.\n\n\u201cYes, openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities \u2014 AI models can be abused by malicious actors or deployed by ill-equipped developers,\u201d the letter acknowledged. \u201cHowever, we have seen time and time again that the same holds true for proprietary technologies \u2014 and that increasing public access and scrutiny makes technology safer, not more dangerous. The idea that tight and proprietary control of foundational AI models is the only path to protecting us from society-scale harm is naive at best, dangerous at worst.\u201d\n\nOn a personal level, LeCun has accused the big-name AI players of trying to secure \u201cregulatory capture of the AI industry\u201d by lobbying against open AI R&D. And on a company level, Meta is doing all it can to encourage collaboration and \u201copenness,\u201d recently partnering with Hugging Face to launch a new startup accelerator designed to spur adoption of open source AI models.\n\nBut OpenAI was \u2014 up until last week, at least \u2014 still the AI darling everyone wanted to dance with. Countless startups and scale-ups have built businesses atop OpenAI\u2019s proprietary GPT-X large language models (LLMs), and over the weekend hundreds of OpenAI customers reportedly started contacting OpenAI\u2019s rivals, which include Anthropic, Google and Cohere, concerned that their own businesses might be impacted if OpenAI was to disintegrate overnight.\n\nOver-reliance\n\nThe panic has been palpable. But there are precedents from elsewhere in the technology sphere, perhaps most notably that of the cloud computing industry, which became renowned for the way it locked companies in to centralized, vortex-like silos.\n\n\u201cPart of the frenzy around the future of OpenAI is due to too many startups over-relying on their proprietary models,\u201d Luis Ceze, University of Washington computer science professor and OctoML CEO, told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to put all your chips in one basket \u2014 we saw that in the early cloud days which led to companies shifting to multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, Microsoft is currently looking like the biggest winner amidst the OpenAI turmoil, as it was already apparently looking to reduce its reliance on OpenAI even though it remains once of its major shareholders. But Facebook\u2019s parent Meta could also stand to benefit, as businesses pursue multi-modal strategies or models with a more \u201copen\u201d ethos embedded.\n\n\u201cOpen source today offers a wide variety of models for companies to essentially diversify,\u201d Ceze added. \u201cBy doing so, these startups can quickly pivot and minimize risk. There is also a major upside \u2014 many of these models already outperform the likes of OpenAI\u2019s in terms [of] price-performance and speed.\u201d\n\nA leaked internal memo from Google earlier this year seemed to express fears that despite the huge advances made by proprietary LLM models from the likes of OpenAI, open source AI would ultimately trump them all. \u201cWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,\u201d the document noted.\n\nThe memo in question was in reference to a foundation language model initially leaked from Meta in March, and which gained a fair bit of steam in a short period of time. This highlighted the power and scalability of a more open approach to AI development \u2014 it enables collaboration and experimentation on a level that\u2019s not so easy to replicate with closed models.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that despite Meta\u2019s claims, its Llama-branded family of LLMs are not as \u201copen source\u201d as it would like people to believe. Yes, they are available for both research and commercial use cases, but it forbids developers to use Llama for training other models, while app developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta which it may grant based on its \u201csole discretion\u201d \u2014 basically, anyone but Meta\u2019s Big Tech brethren can use Llama sans permission.\n\nFor sure, Meta isn\u2019t the only company flaunting its \u201copen\u201d approach to AI development \u2014 notably, the likes of Hugging Face, Mistral AI and 01.AI, which have all raised sizeable sums at lofty valuations with similar goals in mind. But as a $900 billion juggernaut with a long history of courting developers through open source endeavors, Meta is perhaps best positioned to capitalize on the mess that OpenAI has created for itself. Its decision to pursue \u201copenness\u201d over \u201cclosedness\u201d seems to be well vindicated right now, and regardless of whether Llama is or isn\u2019t really open source, it\u2019s likely \u201copen enough\u201d for most people.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to make any surefire claims on what impact the OpenAI fallout will have on LLM development and uptake in the future. Altman and Brockman are undoubtedly steady hands for a commercial AI startup, and they may even return to steward OpenAI. But some might argue that it\u2019s unhealthy that so much focus lies on just a handful of people \u2014 and it\u2019s telling that their departure has created such widespread havoc."

Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nTubi, Fox\u2019s ad-supported free streaming service, has one of the most vast libraries of any streaming service out there, with thousands upon thousands of movies available for you to watch at home.\n\nThat makes it quite difficult to curate the best of the best. I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 when building this list, I looked up my \u201cliked\u201d films on Letterboxd that are currently on Tubi, and more than 100 showed up. So we\u2019ve done our best to narrow that down to a group of excellent movies from a variety of moods, cultures, and eras.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to update this list with more Tubi picks over time, building out a full catalog of excellent free movies for you to watch at home. Our latest update added Planet Terror as an editor\u2019s pick.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\nEditor\u2019s Pick\n\nPlanet Terror\n\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez\n\nCast: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Michael Biehn\n\nFew images feel more emblematic of the bombastic action and humor of Robert Rodriguez\u2019s oeuvre than the shot of Rose McGowan aiming the grenade launcher of a leg-mounted assault rifle from the back of a motorcycle in Planet Terror. Released alongside Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Death Proof as the theatrical double feature Grindhouse, the film follows the story of a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling (McGowan) and her estranged lover \u201cEl Wray\u201d (Freddy Rodriguez), who find themselves among a handful of survivors after a deadly biochemical agent sparks a zombie outbreak. Banding together, the survivors must find a way to escape the town while fighting against the rogue military commander (Bruce Willis) who unleashed the virus in the first place.\n\nIntentionally tongue-in-cheek, Planet Terror\u2019s story and dialogue are the furthest thing from the film\u2019s saving graces. Inspired by the exploitation films of the \u201970s, the movie gleefully relishes in its over-the-top throwback aesthetic, with gory action, comically implausible plotlines, and unabashed sexuality. If you\u2019re looking for a peak \u201cturn your brain off and enjoy\u201d sort of movie, Planet Terror is your ticket to ride. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nCertified Copy\n\nDirector: Abbas Kiarostami\n\nCast: Juliette Binoche, William Shimell\n\nThe late Abbas Kiarostami was one of the most masterful directors of his time, and his masterful romance Certified Copy is available to watch for free at home. Congratulations.\n\nCertified Copy follows two people: a French antique dealer (Juliette Binoche, arresting as always), and a British writer (famed opera baritone William Shimell), who meet in Tuscany while the latter is promoting his new book. The book, titled Certified Copy, puts forth the argument that there is no such thing as a \u201ccopy\u201d in art, because even reproductions are original works. The two debate this idea, as the idea of what is \u201creal\u201d gets called into question, even the very nature of their relationship.\n\nA gorgeous film led by two unforgettable performances, Certified Copy is the kind of masterpiece that will linger with you for years to come. You will fall in love, with this film specifically and with film generally: It depicts humanity at our most impenetrably complex in a way that lays bare our fears and hopes, all while being warm, charming, and delightfully funny. It\u2019s one of a kind, but also in conversation with many other films about love and art. After all, every copy is its own original work. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nHoop Dreams\n\nDirector: Steve James\n\nCast: William Gates, Arthur Agee\n\nThe NBA playoffs have just started with a bang, so what better time than now to watch the greatest basketball movie (and one of the greatest American documentaries) ever made?\n\nHoop Dreams embeds itself with two high school basketball stars who want nothing more than to make it in the NBA. It\u2019s not just a basketball movie, though; director Steve James paints an in-depth portrait of not only his subject\u2019s lives, but of the fallibility of the American dream and who gets left behind. One of the defining movies of our nation, Hoop Dreams is a compelling and moving must-watch for all, not just basketball fans. \u2014PV\n\nJoint Security Area\n\nDirector: Park Chan-wook\n\nCast: Lee Yeong-ae, Lee Byung-hun, Song Kang-ho\n\nPark Chan-wook\u2019s most recent movie, Decision to Leave, was my No. 1 film of 2022, and he\u2019s one of my very favorite filmmakers working today. He\u2019s made many excellent movies over the course of his career, and you can argue it all traces back to Joint Security Area, the breakout hit that helped launch his career.\n\nA tightly wound thriller, JSA stars with the killing of two North Korean soldiers in the DMZ, and a Swiss Army major who has been sent to investigate the killings. As we learn more, JSA starts to become a movie about an unlikely friendship, and the ways that constructs like borders divide us and put is in deadly opposition to each other.\n\nThe highest-grossing movie in Korean history at the time, JSA helped launch Park\u2019s career as well as those of stars Lee Young-ae, Lee Byung-hun, and Song Kang-ho. They\u2019re all excellent in the movie, bringing a complicated and intense story to life. \u2014PV\n\nMandy\n\nDirector: Panos Cosmatos\n\nCast: Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache\n\nYearning for more Nicolas Cage-fueled insanity after watching Renfield and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent? What am I saying \u2014 of course you are!\n\nPanos Cosmatos\u2019 2018 action horror film Mandy not only features what many considered one of the actor\u2019s best performances of the past decade, it\u2019s also \u2014 as revealed in a recent episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert \u2014 one of Cage\u2019s favorite movies he\u2019s ever worked on.\n\nAfter watching Mandy, it\u2019s not hard to see why. Praised for its psychedelic brutality, over-the-top performances, and a prog-rock-inspired score courtesy of the late great composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, Mandy follows the story of a lumberjack who embarks on a conquest of revenge to kill the monstrous Gwar-like cult members who murdered his beloved girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough). You wanna see Nicolas Cage drink vodka in his underwear while wailing hysterically in a pink-tiled bathroom? Here ya go. You wanna see Nicolas Cage go head-to-head against a hulking monster named \u201cFuck Pig,\u201d snort cocaine off a glass table, and get into chainsaw fight? You got it, sport! Mandy is a blast and if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, boy are you missing out. \u2014TE\n\nShadow\n\nDirector: Zhang Yimou\n\nCast: Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai\n\nNo one in the world makes more beautiful action movies than Zhang Yimou. His latest, the political comedy Full River Red, is a fun and strange twist-y thriller that trades some of his usual love for soaring action for fast-paced dialogue and a highly complicated narrative. But Zhang is perhaps best known for his work in the wuxia genre, like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Shadow \u2014 all breathless displays of cinematic excellence.\n\nMuch like Full River Red, Shadow is rich on political intrigue. But it doesn\u2019t skimp on the action \u2014 that umbrella you see above is made of blades, and there are many outstanding action sequences utilizing the unconventional weapon. While in color, Shadow makes great use of black-and-white imagery in every element, from stark costuming and set design to lighting that brings out the contrast of black and white. It\u2019s also a master class of framing bodies in motion and one of the best action movies of the century. We are all lucky to be able to watch it for free. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nSteamboy\n\nDirector: Katsuhiro Otomo\n\nCast: Anne Suzuki, Manami Konishi, Katsuo Nakamura\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo\u2019s 2004 steampunk action anime doesn\u2019t get nearly as much love as it deserves. Steamboy follows the adventures of James Ray Steam, the wizkid grandson of a genius scientist living an alternate 1860s Britain, who finds himself in the crosshairs of a nefarious robber baron who wants to conqueror the world using the \u201cSteamball,\u201d an invention capable of generating an infinite (and dangerous) amount of energy.\n\nIt may not have neon-lit metropolises populated by roving teenage biker gangs and children with terrifying psychic powers like 1988\u2019s Akira, but it certainly doesn\u2019t lack for its own gorgeous Victorian-era visuals, thrilling action sequences, and beautifully realized mechanical animation. If nothing else, Otomo\u2019s film is a marvel of early 21st-century animation, a film situated at the faultlines of traditional hand-drawn cel animation and the anime industry\u2019s gradual embrace of digitally rendered and painted set-pieces and 3D-animated assets.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous love letter to pulp action serials, steampunk alternate history stories, and the writings of Jules Verne cast in a similar mold as another 2004 cult classic: Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. While the film wasn\u2019t quite the second coming of Akira anime fans so eagerly wanted it to be, Steamboy is a more than worthy follow-up to Otomo\u2019s feature debut in its own right and more than enough to tide you over while you wait for an update on Orbital Era, the director\u2019s first anime feature in 20 years, which was announced in 2019. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nWhat Lies Below\n\nDirector: Braden Duemmler\n\nCast: Ema Horvath, Haskiri Velazquez, Trey Tucker\n\nBraden R. Duemmler\u2019s What Lies Below stars Ema Horvath as Libby, a 16-year-old girl who returns home to her mother\u2019s lake house after summer camp to discover that she\u2019s taken on a new boyfriend, John (Trey Tucker). While initially accepting of her mom\u2019s new beau, Libby gradually begins to suspect that something is... off about John that he\u2019s trying to conceal. With no one but her friend Marley (Haskiri Velazquez) to turn to for help, Libby must expose the truth of John\u2019s sinister nature before it\u2019s too late to save her mother... and herself. Filled with mounting tension, creepy ethereal visuals, and a mind-bogglingly bizarre ending, What Lies Below has more appeal to it than what might at first appear on its surface. \u2014TE"

    "body": "The best part of fantasy football is watching the team you draft go out there and have a chance to win a championship, forever cementing your bragging rights over your friends for years to come. The worst part of fantasy is watching the team you drafted go out there and get injured, forget how to play the sport, and then plummet to the bottom of the standings. So if you were one of the lucky ones to reach postseason football in the fantasy world -- congratulations. If you weren't, good news -- just because the regular season has come to a close doesn't mean we can't still keep searching for ways to win. That's why we're heading over to FanDuel to craft the perfect Week 15 DFS lineup to give us something to root for all day long while our friends stress about their team faltering despite dominating for 14 weeks.\n\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:\n\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nFanDuel Picks Week 15: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\n\nSunday main slate, $60,000 budget\n\nQB Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders ($7,200). Stafford returns to the friendly confines of SoFi Stadium after having to deal with the elements in Baltimore last week. After nearly pulling off the upset over the Ravens, the QB has a nice landing spot against a defense that is equivalent to the props used in training camp. Washington can't slow anyone down, and it has only gotten worse since they traded away two of their best defenders at the deadline. Stafford doesn't have the rushing upside, but he's more than capable of having a good day with his arm.\n\nRB Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Packers ($7,600). White stockholders are feeling pretty good right now after singing his praises all offseason. The RB has rewarded them with eight straight games of at least double-digit fantasy performances, including three straight games with at least 100 total yards. Tampa has handed the ball off to White 60 times over that stretch, something that has ticked up with each passing week. As arguably the top option in the Bucs' offense, we'd be crazy to stand in the way of White against a vulnerable Packers defense in Week 15.\n\nWEEK 15 DFS:\n\nDK lineup | Best values | Best stacks\n\nRB Breece Hall, Jets @ Dolphins ($7,500). Did the Jets offense find something against the Texans? We're not quite buying in yet, but it does appear that New York's coaches figured they should stop coaching scared. With the season essentially over for Gang Green barring a miracle, the staff took the handcuffs off Zach Wilson and unleashed an offense that's been run-run-pass-punting their way to irrelevance all season long. In doing so last week, Hall was a weapon as a receiver, posting over 100 total yards for the first time since Week 5. If the Jets continue their willingness to take chances downfield and let Wilson stop being a game manager, then Hall is in line for another big day.\n\nWR Deebo Samuel, 49ers @ Cardinals ($8,400). We'll just keep riding with Samuel down the stretch, as he isn't giving us any reason to reconsider. He has back-to-back games with 30 fantasy points and has been a man on a mission since Thanksgiving. He shouldn't have any problems continuing that run against the Cardinals on Sunday.\n\nWEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWR Puka Nacua, Rams vs. Commanders ($8,000). Usually, one of Nacua or Kupp has a big day, but this week it could both. Either way, we're on the Nacua train heading into Sunday since the rookie has been by far the L.A.'s most consistent weapon all season. Even with Kupp back in the fold, Stafford continues to trust Nacua. He's not seeing the 15-20 targets a game like earlier in the year, but the rookie is making the most of his seven-plus opportunities a game. Against a terrible defense, both receivers should see plenty of chances to make their mark on the game. Nacua checks in at $200 less and is arguably better than Kupp in fantasy at this stage. In a game where every dollar counts, pocketing that extra $200 can really pay off at another roster spot.\n\nWR Rashee Rice, Chiefs @ Patriots ($6,500). There are plenty of issues with the Chiefs' receivers, but Rice is not one of them. The rookie has been very impressive through the first 14 weeks of his NFL career and hauled in yet another touchdown on Sunday to post a respectable fantasy showing. He's been targeted 29 times over the past three games and scored twice. We can expect New England will try to take away Travis Kelce, meaning that the opportunities could be coming even more often for Rice in Week 15.\n\nWEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nTE Chig Okonkwo, Titans vs. Texans ($5,000). Okonkwo has emerged as a nice weapon for the rookie QB Will Levis, with his target share ticking up as the season has progressed. He turned in 45 and 62 yards, respectively, in Weeks 12 and 13, seeing 11 targets in that span. All that's missing is a touchdown. In a brutal week for main-slate TE matchups, we like Okonkwo to outperform his listed salary against a Texans team that's had its fair share of struggles defending the position recently.\n\nFLEX WR Jayden Reed, Packers vs. Buccaneers ($6,100). The status of Christian Watson (hamstring) will hang over the Packers heading into their game against the Buccaneers. Reed is more than capable of having a big day whether Watson plays or not. The former North Dakota State receiver's presence has capped Reed's ceiling recently, but Tampa's secondary is still having major issues doing its job. Jordan Love appears to have turned a corner, meaning we should expect him to put on a show back at home. Reed will be the primary beneficiary on Sunday.\n\nDEF New York Giants @ Saints ($3,500). There is a lot of bad offense across the NFL this season, and despite signing Derek Carr to make sure they wouldn't be listed among them, the Saints are there anyway. The QB refuses to sit out and deal with the laundry list of injuries ailing him at this point despite them clearly being an issue. Teammates appear fed up with Carr and would seemingly prefer the team return him to the dealership. The Saints are upside-down on this deal right now, with no end in sight. The Giants aren't good, but they have enough defensive pop to contain an offense that keeps spinning its tires most weeks.\n\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Week 15\n\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite DFS plays on SuperDraft.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\n\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\n\nHere are the most notable scoring rules for SuperDraft NFL contests: Half-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, two-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\n\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\n\nQB: Matthew Stafford, Rams (Multiplier 1.3x)\n\nRB: Rachaad White, Buccaneers (Multiplier 1.2x)\n\nRB: Bijan Robinson, Falcons (Multiplier 1.25x)\n\nWR: Puka Nacua, Rams (Multiplier 1.25x)\n\nWR: Deebo Samuel, 49ers (Multiplier 1.2x)\n\nWR: Rashee Rice, Chiefs (Multiplier 1.35x)\n\nTE: Tyler Conklin, Jets (Multiplier 1.7x)\n\nFLEX: RB Derrick Henry, Titans (Multiplier 1.2x)\n\nOur SuperDraft lineup aims to keep our Rams stack together with Stafford and Nacua while adding in other players with high floors and ceilings like White, Samuel, and Henry. Considering the matchups, we like taking shots on Robinson, Rice, and Conklin, especially with the multipliers working overtime to bring in an even better score."

Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.\n\nIt's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.\n\nWe'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Christian McCaffrey). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.\n\nIt's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings broken down by position available on SportsLine.

But do expect the Cowboys defense to keep the pressure on Geno Smith and a Seattle offense that's struggled to gain consistency over the last month. Smith actually did OK completing passes last week when pressured (60% completion rate) but not at an efficient level (5.4 yards per attempt). Just two QBs have exceeded 250 yards and four QBs have thrown multiple touchdowns against Dallas this year; I don't like Smith's chances to do either, which hurts any upside case for any Seahawks receiver. By the way, Curtis Samuel was the first receiver to get 100 yards on the Cowboys this year, and it took him 12 targets and 9 catches to get there. No one else has had more than 86.\n\nSTARTS: Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, DK Metcalf (low-end WR2), Jake Ferguson, Cowboys DST\n\nDak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, DK Metcalf (low-end WR2), Jake Ferguson, Cowboys DST SITS: Tyler Lockett (flex at best), Geno Smith, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Zach Charbonnet, Michael Gallup, Seahawks DST\n\nTyler Lockett (flex at best), Geno Smith, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Zach Charbonnet, Michael Gallup, Seahawks DST SLEEPERS: Brandin Cooks\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline DK Metcalf WR SEA Seattle \u2022 #14\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

That kind of usage, especially in a game where the Seahawks figure to pass a bunch, makes him a borderline must-start. But on the 12 targets he's seen that have traveled at least 15 Air Yards over the past four weeks, Metcalf has caught just three. More alarming: Five of the targets were knocked away by defenders who were right on him when the ball arrived. He's not really zooming past anyone these days, and he's not winning contested catches regularly either. Pair that with the expectation that he'll line up across from DaRon Bland for much of the game (Bland usually plays right cornerback; Metcalf primarily lines up at left wide receiver) and it could be a rough one. Bland has allowed one touchdown and has allowed just a 52.5% catch rate with 13 passes defensed and seven interceptions. It's the volume you're banking on this week -- I'd start Metcalf in PPR over Diontae Johnson and Cooper Kupp, but I like the upside for Rashee Rice and Courtland Sutton just a little bit more.\n\nFlex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Tyler Lockett WR SEA Seattle \u2022 #16\n\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs.

He also doesn't see nearly as many deep throws as Metcalf -- literally two targets in his past two games traveled 15 or more Air Yards. Obviously he has potential to always pop off for a big game like he did against a tough Browns defense five weeks ago, but recent matchups against the Niners, Rams and Ravens weren't kind to Lockett. They were even less kind to Geno Smith, and this week shouldn't be much different. Tack on the tough assignment in Stephon Gilmore in coverage (unless the Cowboys use shadow coverage for the first time this year), and Lockett could be in for another lean night. I don't mind him as a WR3 over Drake London, DeAndre Hopkins and Diontae Johnson, but I'd start Rashee Rice and Adam Thielen over Lockett.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jake Ferguson TE DAL Dallas \u2022 #87\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

The Cowboys are expected to lead this matchup pretty handily, which can squash the upside for a lot of yardage from Ferguson. As for his chances of scoring, 37% of his targets (7 of 19) over the past five weeks have come in the red zone. That's good. But the Seahawks have allowed one touchdown to a tight end all season (David Njoku, Week 8)! Mark Andrews had a great game against Seattle, but even he didn't score. I suspect the Seahawks will have a plan to try and cover Ferguson near the end zone without having to sacrifice too much elsewhere. He's a low-upside play I'd sit for Juwan Johnson, Gerald Everett and Logan Thomas.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSeven straight quarterbacks to face the Broncos have failed to get to 20 Fantasy points, including Josh Allen once and Patrick Mahomes twice! Denver's forced at least one turnover from a quarterback in eight straight games and kept quarterbacks to under 7.0 yards per attempt in five straight. Denver also seems to be playing a lot of heavy zone coverage to deter quarterbacks from throwing deep, mostly Cover-3, and they're also starting to blitz more over the last month than they did before. Stroud's Houdini act has helped him beat most of the defenses he's faced, and this one isn't worthy of being feared, but there is some worry Stroud have a monster game without some massive yards after the catch (YAC) from his receivers. Fortunately he ranks ninth-best on the season among qualifying QBs in YAC per completion (5.37).\n\nSTARTS: C.J.

He's top five among qualifying quarterbacks in completion rate at 68.3%, he's first in TD rate at 6.3%, he's fourth in off-target rate (7.8%) and he's clearly worked out his issues with his offensive line because he's landed the fourth-longest time-to-throw average (3.14 seconds). And yet he's done this without firing downfield a ton (32nd in passing ADOT at 6.7 yards)! It hasn't translated for Fantasy because Wilson is averaging 29 attempts per game, and it's even lower in his past six games (26). Expect Wilson to throw more in what could become a shootout against the Texans. QBs against Houston are averaging 34.8 pass attempts per game, and the Texans pass rush shouldn't be a problem. I'd count on Wilson to have a 20-plus point game and thus start him over Kyler Murray, Baker Mayfield, Sam Howell and Jordan Love.\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Devin Singletary RB HOU Houston \u2022 #26\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

Some of that was made up for with receptions, giving him weak yardage totals without a touchdown. Rest assured, Singletary is still clearly Houston's lead back -- he played 81% of their snaps and dominated third downs and snaps inside the 5, even though it appeared Pierce rotated drives with him starting with the third one. The matchup is pretty good as Denver's run defense is the only element that hasn't improved much this season. While it's true that the Broncos have given up just one rushing touchdown in their past six games, it's also true they've let up 5.4 yards per carry in those same six games. Bank on the Texans giving Singletary more work on the ground to pace their offense. I'd start him over Jerome Ford, Javonte Williams and Joe Mixon.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nThe Patriots have seemingly backed off of being blitz-heavy over their past three games, perhaps because they realized they can get similar payoffs without it (only three of their past nine sacks have come on blitzes). They also have an inflated sack total because they recorded six against the Giants -- they have no more than three in any other game this year including zero against the Colts in Week 10. They haven't stopped playing a lot of man coverage lately, which shouldn't bother Justin Herbert because he's efficient against all coverages (and a little bit better against man-to-man). L.A. hasn't put up more than 20 points in two straight, but 20 points should be more than enough to beat a Patriots offense that's scored 17 or fewer points in 9 of its past 10 games.\n\nSTARTS: Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler, Rhamondre Stevenson\n\nJustin Herbert, Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler, Rhamondre Stevenson SITS: Hunter Henry, Quentin Johnston, all Patriots WRs; Demario Douglas is OUT\n\nHunter Henry, Quentin Johnston, all Patriots WRs; Demario Douglas is OUT SLEEPERS: Gerald Everett, Jalen Guyton\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nThe Lions need an answer for their ugly pass defense -- since their Week 9 bye they've been mostly great against the run (3.1 yards per carry allowed, one RB to get 15-plus PPR points) but they rank bottom-six in completion rate allowed (68.4%), yards per attempt allowed (8.0), passing ADOT against (8.84 yards) and defensive Expected Points Added (EPA) per dropback (-0.40, which is league-worst). And of their second-most eight passing touchdowns given up in three games, five have come on passes of 15-plus Air Yards, which is tied for most in the league. They should catch a break with field stretcher Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missing the matchup for New Orleans; Chris Olave looks like he will play. After the injuries to Shaheed and Olave last Sunday it was Alvin Kamara who predictably led the way in targets per routes run (30.8%). Kamara gets a boost both in the pass game and run game with Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone missing action with a hand injury. For the Lions offense, expect the run game to get a bit more focus with Saints linebacker Pete Werner sidelined and All-Pro defensive end Cameron Jordan questionable to play.\n\nSTARTS: Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, Alvin Kamara, Chris Olave (if he passes concussion protocol), David Montgomery, Sam LaPorta, Taysom Hill\n\nJared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, Alvin Kamara, Chris Olave (if he passes concussion protocol), David Montgomery, Sam LaPorta, Taysom Hill SITS: Derek Carr, both DSTs\n\nDerek Carr, both DSTs SLEEPERS: Juwan Johnson\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nThe Falcons defense finally had a strong showing against the Saints last week, but they got a little lucky because so many players from New Orleans left with injuries. In the three games prior their defense had a knack for making mediocre offenses look amazing (Will Levis' breakout game, Josh Dobbs' first game with the Vikings, Kyler Murray's first game with the Cardinals). I'm pretty certain they're not bad enough to make Tim Boyle look like Tim Tebow or even Tim Hasselbeck, but I do wonder if they're juuust bad enough to give better-than-normal numbers to Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall. Reinforcements along the O-line should help the Jets' cause against a Falcons defense that's blitzed at a league-average rate, is eighth-lowest in pass rush pressure rate and is fifth-lowest in sacks (28).\n\nSTARTS: Bijan Robinson, Garrett Wilson, Breece Hall, Drake London, Jets DST, Falcons DST\n\nBijan Robinson, Garrett Wilson, Breece Hall, Drake London, Jets DST, Falcons DST SITS: Kyle Pitts, Tyler Conklin, Tyler Allgeier, both QBs\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nPittsburgh's biggest change in offensive scheme last week involved Kenny Pickett throwing over the middle much more than before (Pat Freiermuth benefitted). But they also ran the ball effectively at Cincinnati -- Najee Harris had one of his best games this year. Expect more of the same against the Cardinals this week. Arizona has allowed five touchdowns to tight ends over its past five games but actually has been relatively efficient defending them otherwise. Can't say the same against the run as the Redbirds rank in the bottom five in pretty much every single run defense metric except yards after contact per rush (where they're league average). A running back has scored 17 or more PPR points in four of their past five against the Cardinals, and eight in 12 games have hit at least 15 PPR points.

In three games, Arizona has become pass-heavy (63.7% pass rate) -- a stark contrast from Conner's five games before injury (55.6% pass rate). And while Conner has had some red-zone carries in those games with Murray, his O-line hasn't kept him clean, especially near the goal line. Meanwhile Murray has a rushing touchdown in three straight games. Conner will face his former team, one that has held all but four running backs to less than 15 PPR points this year, and the ones who notched 15-plus scored a touchdown. If that doesn't make you feel good about Conner, then you'll especially dislike that he's averaged 0.42 yards before contact on his runs since Murray's return, good for 44th out of 47 running backs (Breece Hall and Derrick Henry had it worse). Pittsburgh's unit held the Bengals and Browns in consecutive weeks to 0.5 yards before contact or less. If you start Conner, don't expect an efficient day and pray to Ye Olde Fantasy Gods for a garbage-time touchdown. I'd rather trust Jaylen Warren, Chuba Hubbard and A.J. Dillon.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nExpect plenty of rushing. Losing Jonathan Taylor stings for the Colts but Zack Moss was unreal in his efficiency between Weeks 2 through 5 when Taylor was either out or barely played (5.0 yards per carry is a generic example), and he's only been a little bit worse (4.4 yards per carry) since Taylor took a larger chunk of the workload starting in Week 6. Meanwhile, Derrick Henry was back in a familiar spot of handling plenty of carries against an inferior opponent, scoring twice and tallying 76 rush yards. Anytime he's in a close game or a Titans win, he tends to do well. The Colts rank in the bottom-five in Fantasy points allowed per game this season while the Titans are closer to league-average, but both are in the top-six in RB rush attempts per game against (at least 24.0 each) in their past four games.\n\nSTARTS: Michael Pittman, Derrick Henry, Zack Moss\n\nMichael Pittman, Derrick Henry, Zack Moss SITS: DeAndre Hopkins (PPR flex at best), Josh Downs (PPR flex at best), Will Levis, Titans DST\n\nDeAndre Hopkins (PPR flex at best), Josh Downs (PPR flex at best), Will Levis, Titans DST SLEEPERS: Colts DST, Gardner Minshew\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nWith edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, the Dolphins ranked third in sacks (38) and sixth in pass rush pressure rate (39.9%). Both those numbers were boosted by the defense's effort against a sagging Jets offense last Friday. Adding veteran Jason Pierre-Paul isn't a cure-all, but he will help the Dolphins from being forced to blitz a ton week in and week out. The Commanders offensive line has had some ugly showings lately against the Cowboys (four sacks, 49% pass rush pressure rate allowed), the Giants (four sacks, 32.7% pressure rate allowed) and the Seahawks (three sacks, 46.8% pressure rate allowed). Somehow these results are better than what they were allowing through much of the first two months of the year. Sam Howell getting the ball out faster has been a positive in this regard but a negative for his numbers in three of his past four games (the one game he did really well in was sort of fluky). The matchup is a good test for the Dolphins pass rush post-Phillips, one that it should pass without giving up much in the way of deep completions.\n\nSTARTS: Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Raheem Mostert, Tua Tagovailoa, Terry McLaurin (low-end WR2), De'Von Achane (low-end RB2), Dolphins DST\n\nTyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Raheem Mostert, Tua Tagovailoa, Terry McLaurin (low-end WR2), De'Von Achane (low-end RB2), Dolphins DST SITS: Sam Howell (low-end starter at best), Brian Robinson (desperation RB starter), Logan Thomas (PPR bye-week replacement), Antonio Gibson (PPR bye-week replacement), Commanders DST\n\nSam Howell (low-end starter at best), Brian Robinson (desperation RB starter), Logan Thomas (PPR bye-week replacement), Antonio Gibson (PPR bye-week replacement), Commanders DST SLEEPERS: Curtis Samuel (especially PPR), Jahan Dotson (non-PPR only)\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nWhen Thomas Brown took over the Panthers playcalling for three games earlier this year, the Panthers averaged a 64% pass rate, Chuba Hubbard dominated touches (two games with 17-plus touches, none with more than 10 PPR points) and Adam Thielen had a large target share (26.5%) with a tiny ADOT (4.33). In the two games since, the Panthers pass rate dipped below 60%, Hubbard shared more regularly and Thielen's ADOT nearly doubled. Hubbard had a good game last week, Thielen hasn't seen monster numbers since before the Week 7 bye. The uncertainty of how the Panthers will operate moving forward with Brown basically calling the offense without any oversight keeps these players are risky Fantasy propositions, though it helps a lot that the Buccaneers are dealing with injuries that hurt their run defense (Lavonte David and Devin White will miss the game) and keep their pass defense from improving (Jamel Dean will miss the game).\n\nSTARTS: Rachaad White, Mike Evans, Adam Thielen, Baker Mayfield (low-end QB1)\n\nRachaad White, Mike Evans, Adam Thielen, Baker Mayfield (low-end QB1) SITS: Chris Godwin (PPR flex), Cade Otton (PPR bye-week replacement), Bryce Young, Panthers DST\n\nChris Godwin (PPR flex), Cade Otton (PPR bye-week replacement), Bryce Young, Panthers DST SLEEPERS: Chuba Hubbard (low-end RB2/high-end flex), Buccaneers DST\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Chris Godwin WR TB Tampa Bay \u2022 #14\n\nAge: 27 \u2022 Experience: 7 yrs.

Those were the days. This season he's lined up wide on 68% of his snaps. Can't help but think that's caused the massive change in his production this year -- that and his quarterback isn't a serial slot-targeter (or a Hall of Famer). Godwin's been under 60 yards in five straight, hasn't had a game with even 10 PPR points since Week 8 and has one touchdown on the year despite being tied for 12th among all NFL players in end-zone targets with nine. It gets worse: The Panthers offense can't score and their run defense is so bad, leaving pass-negative game scripts for their opponents. Just two teams (the Saints and Dolphins) have rostered multiple receivers with 10-plus PPR points against the Panthers in 2023. I'd sit Godwin for Josh Downs, Brandin Cooks, Christian Watson and Curtis Samuel (especially if PPR).\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nI wouldn't expect the Rams offensive line to handle the Browns' defensive front like they did the Cardinals' last week, but it must be mentioned that the Browns run defense isn't anywhere near as dominant as it was earlier this year. In their past three games, they gave up 4.1 yards per rush to the Ravens (just 6.3% of their runs went 10-plus yards), 7.8 yards per rush to the Steelers thanks to a long TD run by Jaylen Warren (23.8% of their runs went 10-plus yards) and 4.6 yards per rush to the Broncos (18.5% of their runs went 10-plus yards). Playing more snaps because the Browns offense has been inept isn't the reason for it either because they struggled with the run in the first half against all three teams (over 5.3 yards per carry allowed against each). It's silly to say the Rams passing game is struggling when Matthew Stafford just threw four touchdowns, but Cooper Kupp looked like he played hurt last week and Puka Nacua didn't look that much better. If they're ailing, the Rams would be smart to try and use the run game early and often.

This is actually a great thing for Cooper; over his past two weeks his ADOT sat at 7.57 yards, which was roughly half of what it was in his first nine games at 15.42 yards. Clearly, the Browns wanted Cooper to run shorter routes and make things easier on rookie QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson. I'd expect that to be out the window now -- Flacco wasn't shy about chucking the rock deep with the Jets, attempting passes of 15-plus Air Yards on 20 percent of his throws, and he had no problem focusing on one primary receiver (Garrett Wilson had 8, 14 and 11 targets in Flacco's starts). The hope is that both Flacco and Cooper are experienced and capable enough to develop rhythm to salvage the Browns passing game. It's the only thing to buy into here as the Rams have allowed the 12th fewest Fantasy points to wide receivers on the season and happen to have done well against deep throws against wide receivers (40% completion rate allowed, two touchdowns, both top six on the season). Cooper's volume should hopefully push him to a decent Fantasy stat line. I'd give him a whirl over Terry McLaurin, Marquise Brown and Diontae Johnson.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Cooper Kupp WR LAR L.A.

That was Kupp, who in Week 12 ran a ton of short routes and couldn't separate and didn't have much sudden movement. If he's going to come through this week it'll likely come on a ton of short targets and/or some targets inside the 10-yard line. The fact that he has 13 total targets in his past three games combined makes it tough to buy into him suddenly getting 10-plus targets this week. The matchup is also a problem -- the Browns have the defensive backs to hang tight with a slower-than-normal Kupp in man-to-man coverage, which they play in a lot. The Browns also have the pass rush to force Matthew Stafford to get the ball out quickly and without much distance. I'm not that nervous to bench Kupp for Rashee Rice, Courtland Sutton and both of the top Seattle WRs.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nIn three games since getting Chase Young, the Niners have allowed 30 points total, yielded just 3.3 yards per rush to RBs, 5.9 yards per attempt to QBs, pressured quarterbacks at a 43.2% rate (without blitzing much!), accumulated 15 sacks and picked off four interceptions. As many problems as the Eagles present with their offense, the Niners figure to be just as menacing with their collective defense. That will make things tough for the Eagles, whose defense played over 90 snaps last Sunday and could be without a couple of starters in the front seven, and whose offense could be forced into an uncomfortable game script if the Niners build a lead. Even concepts like utilizing Jalen Hurts' mobility on downfield throws and targets to D'Andre Swift are things the Niners have dealt with successfully this season. Not that you'll sit any of your usual Eagles starters in Fantasy, but some might underwhelm given the circumstances. P.S.: They play at Dallas next week.\n\nSTARTS: Jalen Hurts, Christian McCaffrey, A.J.

The step-up in competition to the Chiefs will clearly impact him and his offensive line, which played better in their games against the Chargers and Lions. Steve Spagnuolo's defense has been blitzing its tails off over the past two weeks (nearly 50% of their snaps against the Eagles and Raiders), so the hunch is they'll apply maximum pressure to that O-line in an effort to make Love more off-target than he's been and, hopefully, get some turnovers. Only one receiver has had more than 15 PPR points against the Chiefs in their past four games (Jakobi Meyers last week), making it tough to expect grand games from Love's favorite targets. I'd expect shutdown cornerback L'Jarius Sneed to line up across from Christian Watson the most -- and Jayden Reed the least.\n\nSTARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Isiah Pacheco, Rashee Rice (worth a look as a WR2), Jayden Reed (low-end WR2/high-end PPR flex), Chiefs DST\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Isiah Pacheco, Rashee Rice (worth a look as a WR2), Jayden Reed (low-end WR2/high-end PPR flex), Chiefs DST SITS: Jordan Love (low-end QB1 at best), Christian Watson (bye-week replacement at best), A.J.

Stroud (four sacks) and ultimately hold the Texans to 21 points should help you accept their defense as a legit unit. Now they'll take on a Bengals offense that was borderline lucky to even score 10 points last week against the Steelers. Two of Ja'Marr Chase's four receptions were tipped by Steelers first, then the Bengals' longest pass play was on a designed dump-off pass to Joe Mixon for 39 yards. Jake Browning had his moments evading the pass rush but his arm strength is just not very good. Expect the Jaguars to bring plenty of heat to Browning, then lean into Travis Etienne on the ground to bring home a win."

    "body": "Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.\n\nIt's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.\n\nWe'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.\n\nIt's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected strength of schedule rankings every week over at SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Trevor Lawrence QB JAC Jacksonville \u2022 #16\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ BUF BUF -5.5 O/U 48.5 OPP VS QB 1st PROJ PTS 15.7 QB RNK 12th YTD Stats PAYDS 943 RUYDS 101 TD 4 INT 2 FPTS/G 16.4 It stings to call Lawrence a dicey Fantasy start because he has potential for greatness, but he's got more upside than all but about 10 quarterbacks this week. Buffalo is savvy when it comes to defending the pass, so I can't say they'll fall off just because star cornerback Tre'Davious White won't play, but I wonder just how effective its pass rush will be without Greg Rousseau and with a sub-100 percent Von Miller (if he plays). Lawrence is a decent starter but I'd rather roll with Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Justin Fields.\n\nLAST WEEK: Can't blame drops this time. With his top receiver blanketed thanks to a heavy dose of man coverage, and with a favorable game script, Lawrence didn't have to do too much to help the Jaguars roll past the Falcons. His TD throw off-schedule to Ridley was awesome, but Lawrence set season-lows in pass attempts (30) and throws of 10-plus Air Yards (20% rate). It's worth noting that Week 4 was the first time all year a defense chose to play significant man coverage snaps against the Jaguars.\n\nTHIRD DOWNS: Stunningly, Lawrence has completed just 50% of his throws here; only Geno Smith has a worse rate among qualifying quarterbacks. Lawrence is averaging 4.4 yards per attempt with a 6.9-yard Average Depth of Target (ADOT) on the money downs, both ranking bottom-six in the league. Only one pass has been dropped on third down. It's been a drain on his Fantasy production.\n\nPRESSURE: Lawrence is neither getting good pass protection nor thriving while under pressure. Statistically he's a mix of average and bad with his 45.7% completion rate, 6.7 yards per attempt and 14.3% off-target rate when defenders get near him. But the worst number is his EPA per dropback of minus-0.72; only Jimmy Garoppolo, Deshaun Watson and Ryan Tannehill are worse there. That means he's hurting his team more than helping when pressured. And to tie in this point with the prior one, he also happens to be among the least-blitzed quarterbacks on third downs this year.\n\nBILLS: Lost top cornerback Tre'Davious White to a torn Achilles last week which means some combination of Christian Benford, Dane Jackson and Kaiir Elam (who had been benched for the first four games) will work at outside cornerback with Taron Johnson in the slot. That looks good, but the Bills pass rush is among the fiercest in football with a top-10 pass rush pressure rate (38.2%) without blitzing much (15.3% blitz rate is second-lowest in football). Unfortunately, pass rush terror Greg Rousseau won't play for the Bills, lowering their dominance in this area.\n\nFlex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Gabe Davis WR BUF Buffalo \u2022 #13\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs JAC BUF -5.5 O/U 48.5 OPP VS WR 11th PROJ PTS 12.6 WR RNK 31st YTD Stats REC 12 TAR 18 REYDS 220 TD 3 FPTS/G 13 Until his role changes, Davis will be the same kind of Fantasy option every week -- one big play and he's a stud, one or two misses and he's a dud. The Jaguars have done well against deep-ball receivers but not enough to the point where benching Davis is a good idea. He's toward the top of the flex mix ahead of Tank Dell, Tutu Atwell, Christian Watson and Jerry Jeudy.\n\nLAST WEEK: Kept playing up to his boom/bust ceiling by catching a long touchdown. That's three straight games with a score. It was also his third game out of four with four or fewer targets.\n\nBOOM/BUST INDEED: Davis has a massive ADOT of 16.8 yards (top-10 among 96 receivers with at least 10 targets this season), but he also has a minuscule target share of 13.6% and a target per route run rate of 13.4% (86th out of those 96 receivers). He's clearly a role player with a big-time skill-set that isn't leaned on too much.\n\nJAGUARS: Statistically are top-three in catch rate allowed to wideouts on throws of 15-plus Air Yards (29.4%) with seven passes defensed, but dead-last in yards per catch (43.8!) and YAC/reception (15.0!) on those passes that are completed. They have done a nice job staying close in coverage on those throws.\n\nZONE COVERAGE: Jacksonville ranks fifth in zone coverage rate (78.5%) and figures to play a lot of it to keep eyes on Josh Allen and deter him from throwing deep. They did the same to Patrick Mahomes in Week 2.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Dameon Pierce RB HOU Houston \u2022 #31\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2 O/U 41.5 OPP VS RB 2nd PROJ PTS 12 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 181 REC 8 REYDS 68 TD 1 FPTS/G 9.7 I genuinely believe Pierce will become a quality Fantasy starter in the near-term, but his matchup is a challenge to begin with and his offensive line makes his outlook even tougher to buy into. For now he's among the TD-needy running back tier who might only give 13 or 14 PPR points even if he does score (which no one has done against Atlanta). He's more than fine as a bye-week replacement RB (or a RB who you kind of have to start because you're thin at the position) but I'd prefer Breece Hall, Isiah Pacheco and Rhamondre Stevenson over Pierce.\n\nLAST WEEK: Had a touchdown called back on a short designed screen and two more runs from 10 yards or closer get blown up. But at least he began to separate from the other Texans rushers and finish with 24 carries and a catch for over 100 total yards, even if the runs weren't efficient.\n\nFILM: Pierce's vision and burst helped him on plays outside of the tackles and in the screen game. He also did an admirable job fighting for extra yards play after play. Houston's doing a great job utilizing him in spite of its offensive line issues, but those issues do show up frequently anytime he ran between the tackles.\n\nINSIDE/OUTSIDE: In total Pierce had 4.7 yards per run on outside plays with two explosive plays and 2.8 yards per run on inside plays with zero explosives in Week 4. On the season he's been a full yard worse on outside runs and about the same on inside runs, so perhaps he and the Texans are improving on those edge plays.\n\nFALCONS: Have run hot and cold against the run but they've ultimately been good by virtue of their 3.8 rushing average and zero rushing touchdowns allowed to running backs this season. They gave up just three runs of 10-plus yards to RBs in their past three games (all against Jahmyr Gibbs, none to Travis Etienne or A.J. Dillon). They've also held backs to 2.7 yards per carry on edge runs while yielding 4.3 yards on carries between the tackles.\n\nFALCONS: Have not allowed more than 8 non-PPR/11 PPR points to any running back so far this season.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decision) Projections powered by Sportsline Tank Dell WR HOU Houston \u2022 #13\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2 O/U 41.5 OPP VS WR 8th PROJ PTS 11 WR RNK 27th YTD Stats REC 16 TAR 24 REYDS 267 TD 2 FPTS/G 14 Dell's upside for one huge catch keeps him in play as a middle-of-the-pack flex, but you should be willing to consider other receivers with safer floors and nearly as much upside. And if the game is low-scoring or a one-sided win for Houston (don't laugh, they just did it last week), it further lowers Dell's ceiling. I'd rather start Romeo Doubs, Christian Watson and Adam Thielen.\n\nLAST WEEK: The Texans didn't need him! Houston built a nice lead thanks to its defense and held on without having to throw the ball a ton.\n\nFILM: The Steelers really emphasized not getting beat deep by Dell, often using a safety over the top to his side of the field to deter C.J. Stroud from even thinking about throwing at him. It worked out for the Steelers because Dell had zero deep targets, and it worked for the Texans because Nico Collins beat soft coverage a bunch including on a 24-yard deep ball (Dell drew triple coverage!) and on his long touchdown score (Dell got a safety to cheat over to his side).\n\nFALCONS: Should be able to deploy the same type of defensive coverage with a safety cheating over to Dell's side of the field. They could also stick outside cornerback A.J. Terrell on Collins and make things a little harder on the Texans. Terrell shadowed a receiver for the first time this season in Week 4, contributing to Calvin Ridley's modest day. It ultimately would mean multiple bodies on Dell.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Kyle Pitts TE ATL Atlanta \u2022 #8\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs HOU ATL -2 O/U 41.5 OPP VS TE 18th PROJ PTS 7.6 TE RNK 13th YTD Stats REC 11 TAR 21 REYDS 121 TD 0 FPTS/G 5.8 If Coach Smith is right, then holding on to Pitts in Fantasy makes sense. But it's hard to see the good in his game so far this season beyond him finding holes in zone coverage. Jonnu even has more red-zone targets than Pitts (by one, three to two). The matchup could create some receiving opportunities, so maybe he catches five passes for 50 yards, but that's not anything to be excited about. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson, Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert.\n\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jonnu Smith TE ATL Atlanta \u2022 #81\n\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 7 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs HOU ATL -2 O/U 41.5 OPP VS TE 18th PROJ PTS 5.2 TE RNK 24th YTD Stats REC 15 TAR 20 REYDS 179 TD 0 FPTS/G 8.2 I feel like Smith is doing what Pitts is supposed to do: get open and make plays after the catch. The hope is we keep seeing that for Smith, especially if the game is competitive like most Falcons games tend to be. He certainly hasn't done anything to lose his role. I don't mind chancing it with Smith as a streaming tight end, though I just don't have the conviction to start him over Pitts.\n\nLAST WEEK: Was the second time in three weeks where Smith outproduced Pitts, but the first time it was so lopsided. The difference in snaps played and routes run is marginal -- Pitts did more of both -- but Smith is taking advantage of shorter routes with a quarterback who doesn't like to challenge downfield all that much. What's more, Smith averaged more yards per catch not just in Week 4 but also in Week 2, and he was behind Pitts by less than a yard in Week 3 when both had at least eight targets.\n\nFILM ON PITTS: There's no change in his explosiveness whatsoever. He's running at a slower-than-expected pace, but the Jaguars still paid him plenty of attention defensively, creating a double-whammy that left him without many targets. His longest opportunity was a deep ball from Desmond Ridder that was well-placed and perfectly leapt for by Pitts, but he couldn't secure it to the ground, nor was he separated from cornerback Tyson Campbell at all. Pitts was best on shorter routes against zone coverage.\n\nARTHUR SMITH: Said this week that Pitts isn't at 100%, adding \" there are certain things, you see him, and he's doing really well right now and there are certain things that he can't [do well]. It's been a journey back. He's going to get there.\"\n\nFILM ON SMITH: From what I see, Smith is running shorter routes and is getting open faster than Pitts. That's earned him some targets from Ridder, who seemed to have better timing with Smith than Pitts. Smith is not drawing any kind of tight coverage like Pitts either, mostly because he's staying closer to the line of scrimmage. But after the catch Smith has been a handful, breaking three tackles just last week and picking up extra yards with it. He's not fast, but he's faster than Pitts, and for at least last week and Week 2 it changed the calculus for how the Falcons divvied up targets.\n\nTEXANS: Have had a bundle of troubles with tight ends, giving up an 84% catch rate and 6.76 YAC/reception to the position, both bottom-six in the league. That includes allowing an 89% catch rate on 18 total targets to Colts and Jaguars' tight ends in Weeks 2 and 3 for 9.9 yards per catch and 7.2 YAC/reception. These numbers were a byproduct of the amount of zone coverage they played against both teams, leaving the short middle of the field open. Houston has played the third-most zone coverage of any team this year and should do so again.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nFlex Starter in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zay Flowers WR BAL Baltimore \u2022 #4\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: Rookie We've come to love (or hate) Ravens-Steelers games for their tough defense and low-scoring battles. That might hurt Flowers' chances of scoring -- it will probably take a little luck, which isn't necessarily too big of an ask given how the Steelers secondary has played recently. If you start Flowers, you're counting on the Steelers run defense staying strong and the Ravens using Flowers to create solid plays as a run-game extension and/or you're hoping for a splash play. That makes him a risky flex with a much safer floor in PPR than half- or non-PPR. In the catch-counting formats I'll start him over Tank Dell, the Broncos WRs, Jordan Addison and George Pickens.\n\nFLOWERS: Has seen his target share increase in competitive Ravens games (not like Week 4's blowout win) and especially when the Ravens run game isn't overly efficient (Weeks 1 and 3). Of his 29 targets, 18 have been on throws of 3 or fewer Air Yards and half of those have been WR screens.\n\nSTEELERS: Run defense has improved considerably over their past two games, giving up just 3.5 yards per tote and 2.22 yards after contact per run against the Raiders and Texans. That could open up more targets for Flowers.\n\nSTEELERS: Haven't seen many WR screens but the ones they've defended have yielded a pathetic 13.75 YAC/reception. This is an exploitable play for Flowers.\n\nDEEP BALL: The Steelers haven't been so hot here either, allowing 16 of 33 targets of 15-plus Air Yards to be completed for 22.5 yards per catch and for three touchdowns. This is an exploitable play for Flowers, who has caught 4 of 5 deep passes for a sizzling 136 yards.\n\nHISTORY: In five career games against Pittsburgh, Lamar Jackson has thrown four career touchdowns. At least all of them went to his wideouts. All were in the red zone, none were on deep throws and none were on WR screens.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Najee Harris RB PIT Pittsburgh \u2022 #22\n\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs BAL BAL -4 O/U 38 OPP VS RB 12th PROJ PTS 9.3 RB RNK 30th YTD Stats RUYDS 210 REC 4 REYDS 34 TD 0 FPTS/G 7.1 The Steelers' lack of scoring opportunities really crushes the upside for Harris, who admittedly has improved this season and could be on his way to being a reliable RB2. The Ravens have been pretty good against the run but they can give up some numbers. Harris is a volume-based back who is at best a low-end starting option given everything that's going on. I'd rather start Breece Hall, Rhamondre Stevenson, Dameon Pierce and Jaleel McLaughlin (if Javonte Williams sits out).\n\nLAST WEEK: Harris had his first game with over 100 total yards against the Texans and averaged 5.1 yards per rush, just shy of the season-high he technically had on six carries against the 49ers in Week 1. A 32-yard reception helped him cross the triple-digit barrier.\n\nHARRIS: This might shock you, but Harris is averaging 4.3 yards per run this year with a 12.2% explosive run rate. Would you believe the explosive run rate, which reflects the frequency of his 12-plus-yard runs, is fifth-best among 44 qualifying running backs?! He's also 13th in avoided tackle rate and top-10 in yards after contact per carry at 3.53.\n\nTOUCHDOWNS: Harris has zero. Somehow it gets worse: He has one carry inside the 15-yard line. The Steelers have run the second-fewest red-zone plays (18, one more than New England) and second-fewest plays inside the 5-yard line (two, one more than New England). The Steelers have played four games! This is nuts.\n\nRAVENS: Have yet to allow a rushing score to a running back this year. They've been otherwise solid against RBs, holding them to 4.0 yards per carry on the season and roughly league-average in other metrics including missed tackles (15). But just three players have averaged over 4.0 yards per carry: Joe Mixon (4.5 yards per run, didn't have 100 total yards, didn't score), Zack Moss (4.1 yards per run, ran for 122 yards on 30 carries and caught a touchdown) and Pierre Strong (9.8 yards per carry, most of it coming in garbage time last week).\n\nHISTORY: Harris had over 120 total yards and a touchdown in a Week 17 win in Baltimore last year. He also scored on them with exactly 50 total yards against them in at home in Week 14. He has posted at least 10 non-PPR points in 3 of 4 career games.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Miles Sanders RB CAR Carolina \u2022 #6\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ DET DET -10 O/U 45 OPP VS RB 5th PROJ PTS 9.9 RB RNK 25th YTD Stats RUYDS 158 REC 15 REYDS 81 TD 1 FPTS/G 10.7 If you start Sanders, you're hoping he finds room for a few long plays, perhaps through the air, and a touchdown. I definitely buy into the Lions run defense to keep Sanders grounded, and his playing time seems to be slipping away. I'd rather start Jahmyr Gibbs, Dameon Pierce and Najee Harris.\n\nLAST WEEK: His playing time hit a season-low 43% of the snaps as he continued losing third-down work to Chuba Hubbard. It hasn't crushed his reception totals at all but it's notable that his only game with more than four grabs came with Andy Dalton under center. Sanders also played just 31% of the Panthers' second-half snaps, a big-time change after his second-half snaps were a lot closer to Hubbard's in Weeks 2 and 3.\n\nSANDERS: His yards per carry has tumbled like a bowling ball downstairs this season, going from 4.0 against the Falcons to 3.1 against the Saints to 2.7 against the Seahawks to 1.5 against the Vikings. Tough matchups? Sure, even including the Vikings. Doesn't mean it's not a good look.\n\nNOT SURPRISINGLY: Sanders has two runs of 12-plus yards through four games -- and neither went more than 15 yards. It's not all on him -- the offensive line for the Panthers barely gave him any daylight last week (and for much of the year) and defenses aren't yet scared of getting beat by Bryce Young's arm.\n\nLIONS: Are a tough matchup, giving up 2.9 yards per rush to running backs on the season. That ranks top-three, as does their yards before contact allowed (0.49) and runs of 10-plus yards allowed (three). Forgive them for the 2.38 yards after contact per rush allowed -- that's only fifth-best in the league. Only Kenneth Walker, on the strength of two touchdowns, has had more than five non-PPR and nine PPR points against these Lions.\n\nLAST YEAR: Detroit was pretty strong against the run last year when they went into Carolina and got absolutely pummeled by the Panthers run game (which included Chuba Hubbard). Coach Dan Campbell knows it -- he accepted responsibility for that loss last year claiming the Lions \"were not emotionally ready to go.\" They should be this time around. Besides, it's a different coaching staff in Carolina and, clearly, a different run game.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jared Goff QB DET Detroit \u2022 #16\n\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs CAR DET -10 O/U 45 OPP VS QB 4th PROJ PTS 20.8 QB RNK 11th YTD Stats PAYDS 1029 RUYDS 12 TD 7 INT 3 FPTS/G 19.6 Any quarterback with upside is a better pick than Goff, who shouldn't have to do too much to help the Lions pull down a win. There will be temptation on his part to test Jameson Williams on deep throws, and no doubt there will be opportunities for Sam LaPorta and Josh Reynolds (and Jahmyr Gibbs, hopefully), but it's more likely Goff has a modest game at home with a couple of scores and maybe 225 yards. I'll give him the nod over Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow, but Jordan Love, Trevor Lawrence, Josh Dobbs and C.J. Stroud all have more potential to help you win.\n\nLAST WEEK: After an interception, Goff marched downfield and got the Lions a touchdown, then gave way to David Montgomery to pound the Packers into submission. He had his lowest number of pass attempts (28) and yards (210) this year, and threw just one touchdown for the third time in four games.\n\nPANTHERS: At 27.9% are dead last in pass rush pressure rate through four weeks. The only game this season when they had some pressure on a quarterback was against the Seahawks, who have a beat-up offensive line. The Lions offensive line is near full strength and have allowed Goff to be sacked five times through four games.\n\nQUARTERBACKS: Have failed to top 20 Fantasy points against the Panthers this season. That includes Kirk Cousins last week, who only threw 19 times in a win (and had two touchdowns but just 13 Fantasy points). Only twice has a quarterback thrown more than TWENTY passes against Carolina.\n\nRUNNING BACKS: Have clobbered the Panthers. For the first three weeks of the year a rusher had at least two touchdowns against the Panthers. Last week no Vikings running back did, but Alexander Mattison (5.6) and Cam Akers (8.0) each had uncharacteristically high rushing averages. Keep in mind: The Vikings have basically operated like they are allergic to running the ball UNTIL they played the Panthers.\n\nGOFF: Played one game last year without Amon-Ra St. Brown. He completed 26 of 39 passes for 378 yards and four touchdowns with an interceptions in a mad come-from-behind effort against the Seahawks, who won the game 48-45. It's unlikely the Panthers will force the issue on the scoreboard like the Seahawks did last season.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Rhamondre Stevenson RB NE New England \u2022 #38\n\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs NO NE -1 O/U 40 OPP VS RB 8th PROJ PTS 13.2 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 164 REC 12 REYDS 87 TD 1 FPTS/G 10.8 The workload is nice for Stevenson, but this feels like a week where he once again won't do too much with it. He's still a decent start ahead of Najee Harris, Khalil Herbert and Jahmyr Gibbs but I'd rather chance my lineup with someone who has upside like Jaleel McLaughlin (if Javonte Williams sits out) or Alexander Mattison.\n\nFILM: The numbers don't quite match the talent -- Stevenson is a capable runner with great vision, balance and power to go with good speed. He struggled on lateral runs last week and his line failed him plenty on north-south runs. Game script kept him from finding a lot of work last week (one fourth-quarter touch).\n\nTHIS SEASON: Stevenson has at least 16 touches in every game, which is good. Unfortunately he has yet to total 100 yards and has been under 70 yards three times, which is definitely the opposite of good.\n\nSTEVENSON: The Patriots front five has gone through all kinds of issues and as a result have contributed to Stevenson averaging 0.98 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 29th out of 44 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.75, which is dead-last among those same 44 qualifiers.\n\nEXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.\n\nRECEIVING: Is averaging 4.0 targets per game and catching 75% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.\n\nSAINTS: Are sixth-best in rushing average to RBs (3.6) and are top-10 in basically every single run defense metric you could think of, including missed tackles with just nine on the year. The only rusher to exceed 10 Fantasy points against them, PPR or not, was Derrick Henry in Week 1. He had 13 PPR points. No one's run for a touchdown on them either.\n\nSAINTS: Aren't quite as impressive against running backs through the air, but they're not awful. Figure them as league average across the board except in YAC/reception (8.53), but that was due to a massive catch-and-run by Henry in Week 1. Since Week 2 their YAC/reception has been 5.94, sixth best in that span with zero explosive pass plays allowed to RBs. So they're pretty good.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nBust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Raheem Mostert RB MIA Miami \u2022 #31\n\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs NYG MIA -11 O/U 48.5 OPP VS RB 23rd PROJ PTS 16 RB RNK 17th YTD Stats RUYDS 249 REC 13 REYDS 115 TD 7 FPTS/G 22.4 If you're starting Mostert, you're hoping he hasn't fumbled away his half of the touches he's had over the past two weeks AND can have the chance at scoring. Miami is capable of giving Mostert more short-yardage work out of the blue, but their actions over the past two weeks suggest Achane is their preferred back near the goal line. Understand the risks in starting Mostert as a No. 2 RB, who could be dog-house bound with another fumble. He's behind Isiah Pacheco and Breece Hall in my rankings but ahead of Jahmyr Gibbs, Dameon Pierce and Najee Harris. Achane is clearly far ahead of Mostert.\n\nLAST WEEK: Before he fumbled the ball away twice, Mostert was splitting reps with De'Von Achane in a way that was unfavorable for him. Before the Dolphins got inside the 10-yard line Mostert had a 16-to-9 edge, then Achane played every single snap inside the 10. Then after Mostert's second fumble of the half, Mostert played just nine of the remaining 35 snaps including nothing near the end zone. Coach Mike McDaniel preached the importance of his offense not having \"self-inflicted wounds\" immediately after the game.\n\nLAST TWO WEEKS: Achane played all but two snaps inside the 10-yard line for Miami, so that seems like a big part of his role that will stick. As for third downs, Mostert has a one-snap edge over Achane at 6 to 5, which means they're splitting those valuable touches. Overall the targets have favored Mostert only because he had more of them in Week 3 against Denver (7 to 4).\n\nGIANTS: Are about to get run over. Their 4.3-yard rushing average they've allowed is a shade worse than league average but they rate poorly in rushing touchdowns allowed (five), rushes of 10-plus yards allowed (14) and missed tackles on runs (24, fourth-worst in football).\n\nDOLPHINS: Have split the workload pretty evenly despite the snap shares morphing in Achane's favor. Last week Achane had 11 touches to Mostert's 10. The week before Achane had 22 to Mostert's 20. The week before that ... Achane wasn't a thing and Mostert had 19 touches to Salvon Ahmed's six (Achane had none). At least we can say over the past two weeks that the Dolphins have used both backs rather evenly in touches, even though WHERE they've gotten them haven't been as equal.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline DeAndre Hopkins WR TEN Tennessee \u2022 #10\n\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 10 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ IND TEN -2 O/U 43 OPP VS WR 25th PROJ PTS 11.6 WR RNK 30th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 31 REYDS 216 TD 0 FPTS/G 9.9 It's been cool to bench Hopkins so far this season but we're staring at a terrific matchup for him to take advantage of, just as other receivers have as recently as last week (Puka Nacua). I think he'll continue to see high-value targets near the end zone and, hopefully, a small uptick in targets. I'd start him as a No. 2 receiver over Terry McLaurin, any Broncos wideouts and any Packers wideouts.\n\nLAST WEEK: Was so close to having a monster game. He was the designed target on a trick play and saw the ball fall just past his outstretched hands in the end zone. He also had two targets inside the 10-yard line (his first two of the season) and two end-zone targets including the aforementioned trick play (his first two of the season). The heavy dose of targets inside the 10 and into the end zone are positive signs that the Titans are trying to get him going as a playmaker.\n\nFILM: Hopkins might be 31 years old but he moved really, really well, creating separation with outstanding footwork and having just enough speed to stay a step ahead of defenders. He got open on a handful of third-down plays when he didn't get a target last week.\n\nTANNEHILL: Is the top problem Hopkins has right now. Hopkins' 38-yard deep-ball catch last week could have been as many as 50 yards if Tannehill hit him in stride, and the gimmick-play touchdown would have obviously been a massive point-getter had Tannehill been slightly more on-target there. There was even a target into the end zone that was a miscommunication between Hopkins and Tannehill. On the season Tannehill has a 13% off-target rate but over the past two games that number has ballooned to 18%, which is ... yikes.\n\nTITANS: The second problem Hopkins has right now is a Titans offense that's stayed true to their run-first preference -- at least when they win. On the year they're throwing the ball 54.6% of the time, 10th-lowest, but in their wins they've thrown the ball 46.4% of their snaps. In losses they've thrown 64.4% of the time. The Colts are one-point home favorites, which means at minimum the game should be competitive, which does not help the pass-run ratio outlook.\n\nCOLTS: Are a frozen yogurt sundae of a dream matchup for Hopkins. On the season outside receivers like Hopkins have caught 72.3% of their targets for 12.7 yards per catch against the Colts. The catch rate is bottom six, the yardage rate is top-12, but the Colts defense leads the NFL in missed tackles on passing plays with 10. Indianapolis also lost their top outside corner, Dallis Flowers, to a torn Achilles. They'll roll with rookies JuJu Brents (80% catch rate allowed) and Jaylon Jones (played two snaps this season) along with already-benched second-year corner Darrell Baker (TD allowed in each of first two games) as outside cornerbacks.\n\nPASS RUSH: Rank fifth-worst in pass-rush pressure rate and seventh-worst in blitz rate AND might be without edge rusher Kwity Paye. The Titans are helped by the return of rookie guard Peter Skoronski and tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere. Tannehill could have more time to throw accurately.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Joe Burrow QB CIN Cincinnati \u2022 #9\n\nAge: 27 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

Or Denver. Or Chicago. You get the gist. The Cardinals pass rush shouldn't be too dangerous and Burrow, now over a month into his season, figures to eventually show some signs of improvement with his health. In no way is he a must start, and there's plenty of good reason to go with Trevor Lawrence, Russell Wilson, C.J. Stroud and even Joshua Dobbs over him, but there's some mild appeal that should at least keep him in lineups over Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones.\n\nLAST WEEK: Looked like a quarterback playing on one leg. Burrow didn't get much into his throws, didn't challenge downfield much, got the ball out as fast as he could and was sensitive to pass rush pressure. Even when the game was in garbage time Burrow couldn't get much going.\n\nAIR YARDS LAST WEEK: Burrow was 1 for 4 on throws of 10-plus Air Yards and 0 for 2 on throws of 15-plus Air Yards.\n\nAIR YARDS THIS SEASON: Burrow has been 11 for 38 on throws of 10-plus Air Yards and 2 for 22 on throws of 15-plus Air Yards.\n\nTOUCHDOWNS: Burrow has thrown just two scores this season. Both came against Baltimore in Week 2, both were throws inside the five-yard line, both were to Tee Higgins. That's it. Even his red-zone stats are unfathomable -- he's completed 7 of 15 passes in the red zone. At least 9 of those 15 throws went into the end zone.\n\nPASS RUSH: Bengals opponents have started to sniff out Burrow's issues and have come after him. The Browns and Titans had a pass rush pressure rate between 38& and 42% in their wins over Cincy with high blitz rates (at least 31% each). Compare that to the Rams and Ravens, who barely brought pressure or blitzes and either lost or nearly lost to the Bengals.\n\nCARDINALS: Are dead-last in blitz rate this season (14%) and third-to-worst in pass rush pressure rate (28%). They actually had nine sacks after Weeks 1 and 2 but have had three since against the Cowboys and 49ers. Arizona seems to prefer using just four rushers to affect the quarterback, something that should be helpful to Burrow this week.\n\nCARDINALS: Rank eighth-worst in completion rate allowed (69.8%, though that was boosted heavily by Brock Purdy's 95% completion rate last week), and are bottom-five in both yards per catch (11.7) and missed tackles on pass plays (49!).\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nBust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Dallas Goedert TE PHI Philadelphia \u2022 #88\n\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 6 yrs.

It shouldn't be lost on Fantasy managers that since Swift became a staple in the Eagles offense, Goedert has taken a backseat. There's always still a shot he scores from short range, but you know how the Eagles like to run the ball when they're near the goal line. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson and Zach Ertz in all formats as well as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet in non-PPR.\n\nTHREE WEEKS IN A ROW: With seven or fewer targets, Goedert has failed to get even 50 yards receiving. His target volume dipped from seven in Weeks 2 and 3 to four in Week 4. Goedert had the same amount of targets as D'Andre Swift.\n\nNICK SIRIANNI: The Eagles coach again said \"[w]e need to get him the football,\" citing that plays designed for him wound up going to other Eagles because of how defenses played Goedert.\n\nFILM: If there's something teams are doing to take away Goedert, I didn't see it on any of his nine third-down routes last week. Goedert still looked sluggish in his movements and didn't run a ton of deeper routes, though there were a couple where he did get open but Jalen Hurts had better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nLAST WEEK: On the plus side, two of his targets were in the red zone and a third was a deep contested catch for 17 yards. On the downside, he dropped that fourth target on a short throw.\n\nGOEDERT: Has three red-zone targets and zero end-zone targets this season.\n\nRAMS: Got stung for two touchdowns to tight ends at Indy last week, one on a 35-yard play where Mo Alie-Cox got matched up with DE-turned-OLB Mike Hoecht. The other was a five-yard toss to Andrew Ogletree, who ran past Hoecht off the snap for an easy touchdown grab. These guys aren't considered primary tight ends like Goedert, though, so it's unlikely the Rams would cover Goedert the same way as they covered them (which is to say, they barely did).\n\nBEFORE WEEK 4: The Seahawks, Bengals and 49ers tight ends, including George Kittle, combined for eight non-PPR/19 PPR Fantasy points over three games against the Rams. L.A.'s pass stats against tight ends were much better before the Colts laid some numbers on them.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jordan Addison WR MIN Minnesota \u2022 #3\n\nAge: 21 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs KC KC -4 O/U 52.5 OPP VS WR 10th PROJ PTS 9.8 WR RNK 34th YTD Stats REC 13 TAR 20 REYDS 185 TD 2 FPTS/G 10.9 While the Vikings are almost guaranteed to throw a ton against the Chiefs, rolling with Addison remains a risk because he's not the definitive No. 2 target, nor is the matchup any good for him. He's a flex at best who I'd sit for Romeo Doubs, Gabe Davis and Christian Watson.\n\nLAST WEEK: Total disaster. In a gamescript that actually gave Minnesota a chance to -- gasp! -- run the ball, Kirk Cousins barely threw the ball and Addison went catchless on one target. There was also a major reduction in snaps played, down to 58%. His season-low was 56% from Week 1.\n\nMATCHUP: With the Vikings capable of running the ball, the offense went with heavier formations. Backup tight end Josh Oliver played about as many snaps as he did in Week 1 and third tight end Johnny Mundt saw a season-high 17% of snaps. Week 4 was the first time all year the Vikings DIDN'T throw the ball on at least 69% of their snaps.\n\nTHIRD MAN: Last week did affirm that Addison may actually be the No. 3 wide receiver in the offense behind Justin Jefferson and K.J. Osborn, but even with the donut Addison still has a five-catch lead on Osborn on the season with 68 more yards gained.\n\nTHIS WEEK: You can bank on the Vikings reversing course against the Chiefs. Two of the past three offenses against Kansas City wound up throwing at least 71% of their snaps. The team that didn't? Chicago, who was so badly blown out by halftime that they ran the ball 55% of their second-half snaps just to get out of Arrowhead.\n\nCHIEFS: Have been stout against receivers all season long, ranking top-five in catch rate allowed (53.4%) and YAC/reception allowed (2.96), and sixth-best in yards per catch given up (11.1). Even if you take out the Bears game the Chiefs have yielded a 56.8% catch rate and 2.93 YAC/reception with a 10.9 receiving average to the Lions, Jaguars and Jets. Drill down even further and they're great against outside receivers like Addison in terms of catch rate (45.8%) and YAC/reception (2.86), but they have allowed 15.0 yards per catch specifically to outside receivers. It's the only saving grace Addison has.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Garrett Wilson WR NYJ N.Y.

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ DEN DEN -1.5 O/U 43 OPP VS WR 24th PROJ PTS 13.5 WR RNK 15th YTD Stats REC 21 TAR 36 REYDS 225 TD 2 FPTS/G 13.9 Is the matchup so easy that Zach Wilson will have tons of time in the pocket to make perfect throws? That's tough to bank on simply because Wilson has rarely thrown the ball with precision. But I like Garrett Wilson's chances of seeing a lot of targets and coming through with at least a couple of big plays against a defense that has been tied in knots for the past eight quarters. I'd start Wilson over Gabe Davis, Jakobi Meyers and any Broncos wideouts.\n\nLAST WEEK: A breakout of sorts as Wilson caught 9 of 14 targets to boost his PPR score, but he ultimately wound up with 60 receiving yards, his second-highest amount of the season. Wilson was real close to cashing in a 29-yard touchdown but Zach Wilson was off-target with the throw.\n\nZACH WILSON: Of the 36 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 11 of them (31%) have been uncatchable. That doesn't include another three incompletions that were either thrown late or predetermined that defenses were able to sniff out.\n\nSILVER LINING? Garrett Wilson is clearly the alpha of the passing game, collecting at least twice as many targets this season than anyone else on the Jets.\n\nTHE REAL SILVER LINING: The Jets will take on a Broncos defense that has been awful to watch. No defense has allowed a higher catch rate (85.1%) or scored a worse Defensive EPA per drop back (minus-0.79) collectively to wide receivers than the Broncos. And after yielding an 86.7% catch rate ad 20.8 yards per catch to the Dolphins in Week 3, Denver turned around and let up a 92.9% catch rate and 15.6 yards per catch to the Bears in Week 4! Even top cornerback Pat Surtain has allowed a high-for-him 63% completion rate this season. Surtain allowed four catches for 56 yards over six targets in his coverage last week. It does not help that Denver's pass rush has been practically non-existent.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Russell Wilson QB DEN Denver \u2022 #3\n\nAge: 35 \u2022 Experience: 12 yrs. I chose to drop Wilson in my rankings because this should be one of his toughest matchups of the season, and his reliance on outside receivers and the deep ball are at risk given this matchup. We might see a much more subdued and boring version of Wilson's game, which means he could very well wind up with a stat line like Mahomes had against the Jets last week. I'd rather start Jared Goff, Trevor Lawrence, Joshua Dobbs and C.J. Stroud.\n\nLAST WEEK: Was the second time in three games Wilson had 28-plus Fantasy points. It helped that he played a bad Bears defense with a beat-up secondary. His other high-score game? Week 2 against the Commanders, where he had 92 yards and a Hail Mary touchdown in the final 0:48 to boost his score an extra 9.7 Fantasy points (he still had 22.2 points without it).\n\nTHE JETS: Have given up over 16 Fantasy points to a quarterback ONCE all season -- Dak Prescott in Week 2. The other three they faced, including Josh Allen in Week 1 and Patrick Mahomes last Sunday, were under 16 Fantasy points.\n\nPASS RUSH: The Jets tend to get to the quarterback without blitzing (19.5% blitz rate is bottom-five), getting some pressure on 41.6% of their snaps so far this year, which is third-best in the league. And it's been consistent -- their only \"low\" game was at Dallas and they still bugged Prescott 32.5% of the time. That's a lot.\n\nO-LINE: Denver's front five allows the sixth-highest pass rush pressure rate this year at 39.5%. The Bears had pressure on 32.3% of their dropbacks against Denver last week, their second-highest of the season (they did blitz a bunch).\n\nWILSON: His numbers when pressured don't look bad over the course of the season, but they're weighted by his numbers against the Raiders in Week 1. In his past three games when he threw a lot against Washington, Miami and Chicago, Wilson completed 56.4% of his passes when pressured for 8.0 yards per attempt with a better-than-most 5.1% TD rate and a great off-target rate of 2.6%. Of those numbers, only his off-target rate is somehow better when pressured than not pressured; the rest are all much better when he has time. He shouldn't have much time this week.\n\nDEEP BALL: The Jets are also pretty good versus throws of 15-plus Air Yards, giving up just a 40.7% completion rate with four interceptions and an in-context low number of 23.1 yards per grab (seventh-best). Wilson ranks top-10 among quarterbacks in completion rate (50%) and yards per attempt (17.2) with the second-lowest off-target rate (12.5%) on those long throws but is below league-average in overall attempts. His numbers are also inflated because of that Commanders game and the Hail Mary he hit on.\n\nVS. OUTSIDE WRs: The Jets allow the second-highest catch rate to perimeter guys (79.4%), but they're top-five in yards per catch (10.7), ADOT (10.38) and completions allowed of 20-plus yards (three, which is best in NFL). Outside guys have also seen the third-fewest targets because teams know not to attack there.\n\nWILSON: 50 of his 132 passes (38%) have gone to outside receivers this year. Seven of his nine touchdowns have headed that way too. This is a problem for Wilson.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jake Ferguson TE DAL Dallas \u2022 #87\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. The only reason to give Ferguson the nod is because he's a safety valve for Prescott to lean on. It's a volume play where you're counting on Ferguson to catch six or seven balls and average around 10 yards per catch. It makes him much more appealing in PPR than non-PPR, which is why I'm OK starting him over Dallas Goedert and Kyle Pitts.\n\nLAST WEEK: Was the benefactor of Dak Prescott taking what the Patriots defense gave him, mostly utilizing Ferguson as a short-area target to fire the ball to when the pressure was quick off the snap. But there were a couple of throws where Prescott read the defense well and found Ferguson for pretty good gains. All told Ferguson led the Cowboys with seven targets and seven catches for 77 yards in three quarters of work.\n\nTHIS WEEK: The 49ers figure to unleash its pass rush on Prescott with zone coverage behind it, which only makes sense given how Prescott has handled the pass rush pressure this year. It should mean more short throws for Ferguson.\n\n49ERS: Are tops in football in catch rate allowed to tight ends (48.6%) and YAC/reception allowed (1.29 yards). They're also top-five in yards per catch (7.1). These numbers are even more amazing when you realize tight ends have averaged 8.8 targets per game against the Niners this season, third-most in football. Tyler Higbee and Darren Waller were completely humbled, but Zach Ertz had 11 PPR points last week and nearly caught a touchdown. Pat Freiermuth did catch a touchdown in Week 1 to earn him seven PPR points.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Brock Purdy QB SF San Francisco \u2022 #13\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. It's safe to expect Purdy to feel a lot of pressure against the Cowboys, and throwing in man coverage behind it could create some havoc that could speed up Purdy. He's been so consistent and the 49ers are so loaded, but this is just one of those rare matchups where there's too much downside to buy into Purdy. After ranking him high early in the week I've moved him behind Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Trevor Lawrence, but still ahead of Joe Burrow, Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones.\n\nLAST WEEK: Purdy's been a find ever since the 49ers put him on the field but last week he executed their offense flawlessly. Seriously -- he missed on one throw. And for the second time this season, Purdy threw a pass that was ruled a lateral for a touchdown, robbing his Fantasy managers of precious points. Of course, it helped that he played Arizona, a defense that has taken a step back in pressuring quarterbacks.\n\nPURDY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 8 of his 9 regular-season starts, and it really should be 9 for 9 because of that first touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 9 of 11 games. And in 5 of those 9 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past two games.\n\nCOWBOYS: Dallas' defense lost top cornerback Trevon Diggs and they're still red hot. They lead the league in pass rush pressure rate this season (55.6%) and they're in the top-10 in blitz rate (31.9%). It's that pressure that's helped the Cowboys rank in the top-five in completion rate allowed (57.4%), passing touchdowns allowed (two) and missed tackles on pass plays (just five, that's best in football). Only Joshua Dobbs, who ran for 55 yards, has scored double-digit Fantasy points against the Niners (18 points). Not that the Cowboys have been tested much -- Daniel Jones, Zach Wilson and the Patriots QBs are the other guys they've man-handled.\n\nO-LINE: San Francisco has allowed a pass rush pressure on 36.4% of their snaps, which sounds like a lot but it's just a shade worse than league average. That number is weighted by the Giants' decision to blitz on 84.6% of Purdy's dropbacks in Week 2, creating an inflated pass rush pressure rate. Despite the Giants' efforts, Purdy still threw for 310 yards and two touchdowns in a game he didn't have Brandon Aiyuk in.\n\nCOWBOYS: Have become one of the most aggressive defenses in the league, ranking third from the bottom in zone coverage snaps. And truthfully, the only quarters they've actually played heavy zone have been at the end of blowout wins over the Giants and Jets. If they keep that up they'd look completely different than in their playoff meeting against Purdy in January when they played heavy zone for nearly 86% of their snaps.\n\nPURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but four of his five passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 48.6% of his throws for 5.6 yards per attempt with a gaudy 18.9% off-target rate.\n\nLAST YEAR IN THE PLAYOFFS: The Cowboys pressured Purdy on 48.5% of his drop backs despite blitzing just 21.2% of the time. Purdy completed 65% of his throws but struggled mightily with 214 yards passing and no touchdowns.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jordan Love QB GB Green Bay \u2022 #10\n\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs. The Raiders' track record against QBs and Love getting Aaron Jones and Christian Watson back without snap limits are what provides the most optimism here. The return of guard Elgton Jenkins helps, too. Love has upside to get back to 25-plus Fantasy points like he had in Weeks 1-3. I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Joe Burrow and Jared Goff.\n\nLAST WEEK: Obviously the Lions pass rush was too much for him and the Packers offensive line in the first half. Motown especially played a lot of zone coverage early and Love still threw into the teeth of it. He calmed down in the second half and took more of what the Lions gave him and really got into a groove before making a bad read on a miscommunication with Romeo Doubs for his second interception.\n\nA POSITIVE? Despite the turmoil last week, Love had season-bests in completion rate (63.9%) and off-target throws (11.1%) while still averaging a hefty 9.5 ADOT, which was his second-lowest on the year but still above league average.\n\nFILM: I remember pointing out in the preseason that Love was late on a few of throws. That was the case in Week 4, but the bigger issue was passes sailing high on him because he was putting too much of his body into his throws. Combine those things with his penchant for attacking deep and it's no wonder he had a bad game. But there's something else -- Love was pass rush ignorant, meaning he didn't let the Lions' pressure scare him, even if it did wind up overwhelming him for some early-game sacks.\n\nRAIDERS: Deserve credit for trying -- in the past two weeks they lead the NFL in pass rush pressure rate and are 10th in blitz rate. Playing weaker offensive lines in Pittsburgh and L.A. have helped boost those numbers, but quarterbacks are still finding success to the tune of 13.9 yards per catch and 7.07 YAC/reception over those two games, both bottom-three in the league. And, both quarterbacks the Raiders played in Weeks 3 and 4 each posted at least 22 Fantasy points (Kenny Pickett, Justin Herbert without his second-best receiver and without his top running back).\n\nRAIDERS: The hunch is the Raiders will keep bringing the blitz and play a lot of gutsy man coverage behind it. They've been playing more man coverage in two of their past three games and have really only moved to heavy zone against the Broncos in Week 1.\n\nLOVE: Has been a mixed bag against man coverage -- his completion rate has been terrible at 39.4%, but his touchdown rate has been outstanding (12.1%). Plus more man coverage and more blitzing could result in more rushing for Love, which he's shown he's willing to do.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nBust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Justin Fields QB CHI Chicago \u2022 #1\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

The deep-ball opportunities are a huge plus if Fields has good protection like he had last week. But if the short-week preparation doesn't scare you a little, his lack of rushing should since we're effectively starting him only for his passing chops. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Anthony Richardson and Jordan Love have more potential than Fields this week, but guys like Russell Wilson, Trevor Lawrence, Dak Prescott and Jared Goff don't. You just might not have a better option than Fields.\n\nLAST WEEK: Posted his first-ever game with four passing touchdowns and over 300 yards against a Broncos defense that was devoid of a serious pass rush or pass coverage skills through the first three quarters. By the fourth quarter the Broncos were generating heavy pressure and Fields finished 5 of 11 for 50 yards and no touchdowns with two turnovers.\n\nFILM: For three quarters Fields looked terrific firing downfield from clean pockets with plenty of great reads and accurate throws along with a play or two where he manipulated defenders with the threat of him running only to throw over their heads, including on Kmet's short touchdown. His off-target rate was literally 0.0%. But by the fourth only some plays were fine -- on others he either was pressured, threw off his back foot, threw with too much velocity or wasn't on the same page as his target. His off-target rate in the fourth was 9.1%, which was closer to what he had averaged in his first three games (13.6%).\n\nBRONCOS: Have allowed season-best Fantasy numbers to each of the past three quarterbacks they've played this season. They're a terrific matchup for anybody right now. Remember this when we talk about the Jets.\n\nCOMMANDERS: Sport a slightly below-average pass rush pressure rate thanks to only one game all year with a rate over 30% (52.7% at Denver, and Wilson still had a great game even if you take away a Hail Mary touchdown catch). They rank seventh in sacks (13) and 13h in pressures (53), which again floats around league average.\n\nBEARS: Rank league-worst in pass rush pressure rate allowed at 47.4% of their snaps -- nearly one out of every two drop backs is pressured. Bringing back guard Teven Jenkins might help a little, but they're still a struggling unit.\n\nDEEP BALL: Washington ranks bottom-five in attempts, yards per catch and touchdowns allowed on pass plays of 15-plus Air Yards over the past three weeks. This is an area Fields can exploit -- he's tied for the most touchdowns on throws of 15-plus Air Yards this season than Fields with four and is around league-average in completion rate, attempts per game and Expected Points Added (EPA) per drop back.\n\nLAST SEASON: Washington got a season-best 57.1% pass rush pressure rate on Fields and blitzed him on 40.5% of his drop backs. Fields had one passing touchdown and one interception and still had nearly 20 Fantasy points because he ran for 88 yards.\n\nRUSHING: Fields followed up a Week 3 game with seven designed runs with just two designed runs in Week 4 for two total yards. On the season he's totaled 28 rushes for 134 yards and a score.\n\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Sam Howell QB WAS Washington \u2022 #14\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

While there's potential for that on Thursday, it's not a certainty. Howell could just as easily put up nominal stats to help the Commanders bring home a win. With upside an issue, think of Howell as a sleeper with 20-point potential. I'd rather start Jordan Love, Jared Goff or Justin Fields, but taking Howell over Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow isn't crazy given their matchups and/or situations.\n\nLAST WEEK: Bounced back from a horrid four-INT loss in Week 3 to complete nearly 71% of his throws for 290 yards with one touchdown and a very clutch 40 rushing yards at Philly. This was the most efficient game of his young career, but it was also the busiest game of his career as he threw 41 passes and ran six times. Playing into overtime helped his cause.\n\nHOWELL: Has one game out of five as a pro with multiple passing touchdowns, and two others with one rushing and one passing score.\n\nBEARS: Are one of the easiest matchups for a quarterback. They rank in the bottom-seven in completion rate allowed (70.1%), yards per catch allowed (12.2), Yards After Catch per reception (YAC/reception) allowed (6.26, second-most) and missed tackles (52). One more factor: Chicago ranks poorly in pass rush pressure rate, blitz rate and has just two sacks all season.\n\nHOWELL: When not pressured has completed 73.8% of his throws for 7.2 yards per attempt with a 9.7% off-target rate. None of these are particularly impressive -- they're all about league-average -- but that's still a plus for Howell considering this week's matchup.\n\nPASS ATTEMPTS: Through four weeks the Bears are seeing an average of 31.8 pass attempts against them per game. Even in a game the Bears led for much of last week, the Broncos tried just 28 throws. On the flip side, three of the four quarterbacks Chicago faced found three touchdowns on their limited throws.\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Terry McLaurin WR WAS Washington \u2022 #17\n\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs CHI WAS -6 O/U 44.5 OPP VS WR 19th PROJ PTS 15.2 WR RNK 21st YTD Stats REC 21 TAR 26 REYDS 212 TD 1 FPTS/G 12.1 The Commanders may wish to win this one with a big dose of the run game (Brian Robinson is a must-start), but if the Bears put up any offense at all, McLaurin will be in position to put up nice numbers. He's a low-end WR2 worth the nod over George Pickens, Zay Flowers, Drake London and Jahan Dotson.\n\nPAST THREE WEEKS: McLaurin has led all Commanders wide receivers in targets and all Commanders players in receptions. He's the No. 1 guy, and his big Week 4 game (8-86-0 with an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown) would have been even bigger if Sam Howell had better ball placement on a deep pass McLaurin was open for.\n\nBEARS: Are expected to play again without top outside cornerback Jaylon Johnson and safety Eddie Jackson. Not that those two absences led to a bonanza from Broncos receivers; Russell Wilson spread the ball around. But if McLaurin remains the target leader then he'll have the best shot at a big game. Rookies Tyrique Stevenson and Terell Smith figure to line up across from McLaurin the most.\n\nMATCHUPS: Each top-target earning wide receiver that plays mostly outside (like McLaurin) has found at least 10 PPR points in every game against the Bears. That includes Rashee Rice in Week 3 (7 targets, 5-59-0), Courtland Sutton in Week 4 (5 targets, 3-27-1), Romeo Doubs in Week 1 (5 targets, 4-26-2) and Mike Evans in Week 2 (8 targets, 6-171-1). Note that these receivers combined to catch 18 of 25 targets (72%) against Chicago."

    "body": "Singer Taylor Swift has a blank space, and she's writing Travis Kelce's name. There were rumors the two were dating for weeks, and those talks only intensified with swift attending five Chiefs games so far this season, including Sunday's game agains the Chargers.\n\nThe Era's Tour singer was seen chatting with the tight end's mom, Donna Kelce, and cheering emphatically when No. 87 scored a touchdown in the first game she attended last month. Last week, she was in attendance to watch the Chiefs as they defeated the Denver Broncos in Week 6 on \"Thursday Night Football.\"\n\nShe is once again at Arrowhead Stadium, this time to watch the Chiefs take on another AFC West opponent, the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nFor those wondering how this apparent relationship came to be, wonder no longer. We have created an extensive timeline of the high-profile couple that is currently the talk of the league, and even added some Swift lyrics to go along with some of the highlights.\n\nHere's a look at how it all started and where it has gone since:\n\nJune 29: Kelce makes friendship bracelets for fellow TEs\n\nIs this where it all begin? Kelce made a friendship bracelet to give to the newcomers at a camp for NFL tight ends. He said he was \"taking a page out of Taylor Swift's book.\"\n\nJuly 26: Kelce makes friendship bracelet for Swift\n\n\"So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.\" - You're On Your Own Kid\n\nKelce announced that he went to Swift's highly anticipated concert, but said he did not have the chance to meet the 12-time Grammy winner.\n\n\"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings ... She doesn't meet anybody, or at least she didn't want to meet me, so I took it personal,\" Kelce said on an episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast he does with his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.\n\nHe revealed that he made a friendship bracelet, a fan tradition at her concerts, with his number on it to give to her, seemingly expressing his interest in Swift. When his brother asked if it was his jersey number or his phone number, Kelce replied, \"you know which one.\"\n\n\"If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\"\n\nAug. 5: Kelce names his celebrity crush\n\nWell before the two were rumored to be dating, Kelce was asked his crush. But before he could even answer, the answer was given for him.\n\nSept. 14: Rumors aren't denied\n\n\"The rumors are terrible and cruel, but honey, most of them are true.\" - New Romantics\n\nOf course people were going to ask Jason, who is very close with his brother, whether rumors of the two hanging out were true. He did not confirm them, but he also did not deny them.\n\nSept. 17: The references begin\n\n\"I watched it begin again.\" - Begin Again\n\nThe rumors began to pick up, and now there were a lot of people, commentators included, making Swift references around Kelce.\n\nWhen the tight end caught a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes, CBS Sports' Ian Eagle said, \"Kelce finds a blank space for the score.\"\n\nThis was only the start to many, many, Swift lyrics being referenced during NFL games.\n\nSept. 21: Kelce sends Swift an invite\n\n\"So inviting, I almost jump in.\" - Gold Rush\n\nWhile on the Pat McAfee show, Kelce discussed the rumors and sounded somehow surprised people are talking about it.\n\n\"It is hilarious how much traction this has actually got,\" he said of all the talk. \"It's like that old game in school called telephone where everybody is just whispering in each others ear, just hearing some random stuff. Especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides.\"\n\nHe then admitted that he invited Swift to one of his games, joking that they would compete to see who put on the bigger show at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Chiefs.\n\n\"I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court and I told her you know, I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one is a little more lit. We will see what happens in the near future.\"\n\nSept. 22: Another bracelet\n\n\"Lately [he's] been dressing for revenge.\" - Vigilante Sh--\n\nKelce was spotted at his nonprofit charity event wearing a bracelet that says \"Vigilante Sh--,\" the name of one of Swift's songs.\n\nSept. 24: Swift attends Chiefs game\n\n\"Dating the boy on the football team.\" - Fifteen\n\nSwift took Kelce up on his offer and attended the Chiefs' Week 3 game against the Chicago Bears. Swift was dressed on theme and was watching intently, cheering and even chest bumping someone during big plays. She was especially thrilled to see Kelce get in the end zone, a three-yard catch that put the Chiefs up 41-0. Kansas City went on to win 41-10 to improve to 2-1.\n\nSept. 24: Swift mingles with Donna Kelce\n\n\n\n\"Talkin' over a football team.\" - Mean\n\nSwift already seems to be making friends with the family. Swift was sitting next to Donna in the box and the two were seen talking and laughing as the game went along.\n\nSept. 24: Postgame interviews turn into Swiftie talk\n\nThe postgame press conference seemed more about Swift and Kelce than it did about the actual game. The media wanted any insight it could get into the relationship and how Swift ended up at Arrowhead.\n\n\"He told me at the last minute,\" Mahomes said when asked if he knew Swift was coming. \"There's some things with Trav where he kind of just says it and you don't know if it's true or not. He says it so calmly. ... Friday he was like, 'Yeah, I think she's coming to the game this weekend,' and then moved about his business.\"\n\nHead coach Andy Reid was also asked about his star tight end's supposed relationship, to which he quipped, \"I set them up.\"\n\nSept. 24: Kelce and Swift leave stadium together\n\n\"You know when it's time to go.\" - It's Time To Go\n\nThis was the first time the two were photographed together. They walked side by side, Kelce fittingly wearing an outfit with \"1989\" in the title and Swift wearing a Chiefs zip-up.\n\nSept. 24: The two leave in a convertible\n\n\"Nothing good starts in the getaway car.\" - Getaway Car\n\nSwift and Swift were spotted in a convertible, with the tight end driving, after the Chiefs' win. Kelce reportedly rented out a restaurant for a private party with Swift and his teammates.\n\n\"Taylor Swift likes that Travis Kelce 'pursued her' and the two are having a 'great time getting to know each other,'\" a source told Entertainment Tonight. \"'Taylor wants a guy that's into his career, does his own thing, but is also supportive and understands her,' the source added, \"and Travis fits those qualities.'\"\n\nSept. 25: Kelce jersey sales skyrocket\n\nCall it what you want; I'll call it the Taylor Swift effect. Since Swift attended the Chiefs game, there was a 400% increase in Kelce jersey sales, his podcast is No. 1 overall on Apple, he gained over 380,000 Instagram followers, and 24.3 million people watched the game, making it the No. 1 game last week, according to Front Office Sports.\n\nThere has also been triple the \"Chiefs\" searches on web and triple the Chiefs ticket sales on Stubhub.\n\nSept. 25: Belichick weighs in on the matter\n\n\n\nNew England Patriots head coach does not always comment on situations that take place in the game, but he was fully ready with a sound bite on the Kelce-Swift situation.\n\n\"Well I would say that Travis Kelce's had a lot of big catches in his career. This would be the biggest.\"\n\nSept. 26: Chiefs games get even more popular\n\n\"Welcome to New York (*New Jersey), it's been waiting for you.\" - Welcome to New York\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champions are already one of the more popular teams in the league, but it is becoming the hottest ticket in town, no matter what town that is.\n\n\"Since Swift's appearance at the Chiefs game on Sunday, the Jets have sold more tickets for their game against the Chiefs in a single day than since the season started -- by more than double,\" a representatives at StubHub told to Town & Country magazine.\n\nSept. 27: Mahomes confirms he met Swift\n\n\"It was enchanting to meet you, all I can say is I was enchanted to meet you.\" - Enchanted\n\nMahomes said he had not met Swift when asked in the postgame press conference, but he did meet her at the afterparty.\n\n\"Yea I met her. She's really cool. Good people,\" Mahomes said, via KSHB 41 in Kansas City. \"But like Trav said, imma let them have their privacy and just keep it moving.\"\n\nSept. 27: Kelce breaks his silence\n\n\"And they said speak now.\" -Speak Now\n\nKelce addressed Swift's attendance on his podcast, saying, \"To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high-fives with Mom, to see how Chiefs Kingdom was all excited that she was there -- that s--- was absolutely hysterical. It's definitely a game I'll remember, that's for damn sure.\"\n\nHe is not going to speak too much more about the relationship, noting that he wants \"to respect both of our lives.\"\n\n\"Yeah, my personal life -- that's not so personal. I did this to myself Jason, I know this. What's real is that you know it is my personal life. ... She's not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week.\"\n\nSept. 27: Jerry Jones comments on the Swift effect\n\nSwift is getting the owners talking, too.\n\n\"It is hard to move that needle dramatically on a great feeling, a great attraction in the NFL,\" Jones said Wednesday on 105.3FM The Fan in Dallas. \"We get a lot of eye balls. She blew it off the charts. It is amazing. It makes you smile. But it just shows the depth of her following, especially with her core constituency. We all, I think, felt the same way when she's sitting up there with [Travis Kelce's] mom and she's going nuts when he's playing and those hearts are popping out everywhere. How do you not get that? That's called images right there.\"\n\nOct. 1: Swift attends Chiefs-Jets\n\n\"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you,\" - Welcome to New York\n\nOK, so the Jets technically play in New Jersey, but we're just basing this off their name. Swift went to her second consecutive Chiefs game, showing up with some famous friends, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. In the week leading up to the game, there were reports that the singer would be at the game. The Chiefs defeated the Jets 23-20.\n\nOct. 5: NFL defends itself\n\nSwift coverage is everywhere and the league even changed their social media bio to one of the singer's lyrics. The league's X (formerly Twitter) bio to read, \"NFL (Taylor's Version),\" while their Instagram account read, \"Chiefs are 2-0 as Swifties.\"\n\nSome found issue with these changes, but the NFL said this is a \"pop cultural moment\" and they are acting as such.\n\n\"We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what's happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,\" the NFL wrote in a statement. \"The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we've leaned into in real time, as it's an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we've seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.\"\n\nOct. 6: Travis and Jason think the NFL is doing too much\n\nThe NFL is really digging into the Swift-Kelce coverage, and not everyone is a fan, including the people involved.\n\n\"I think it's fun when they show who's at the game,\" Travis said. \"I think it brings a little bit more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you're watching. But at the same time, they're overdoing it a little bit.\"\n\nJason also chimed in on the matter, saying, \"I just think the NFL is not used to celebrities coming to the games. Like basketball has it all figured out. They're all courtside, they're sitting there. They show 'em once or twice, but then they get back to the game.\"\n\nOct. 12: Swift attends Chiefs-Broncos\n\n\"Now it's too late for you and your white horse *Bronco, to come around\" - White Horse\n\nOne day after her movie premiere, Swift is in the house for the Chiefs' \"Thursday Night Football\" divisional matchup against the Broncos. The game is taking place at Arrowhead Stadium, where Swift has performed herself and attended a game before. According to Al Michaels, the game will have minimal Swift coverage, though so far there has already been a mention of the superstar.\n\nOct. 15: Kelce, Swift make 'SNL' cameos\n\nThe two were spotted out in NYC together and then had a surprise appearance on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Kelce had a cameo in a skit about how much coverage Swift was getting during games, while the singer introduced the musical act of the night, Ice Spice.\n\nOct. 22: Swift attends fifth Chiefs game\n\nSwift has now attended games broadcast across all five networks (CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN and Amazon). This week, she is watching the Chiefs face the Chargers and will be shown on CBS. She is sporting a Chiefs sweatshirt and is seated next to Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany."

    "body": "Line shopping is the key that unlocks the best odds and lines at top sports betting sites.\n\nThe process is as simple as checking the lines and odds for your prospective bet at multiple online sports betting sites. The result is quite often better odds and improved lines.\n\nWhat is line shopping, and why is it worth your time? Find the answers below in our complete guide to line shopping.\n\nHow do sportsbooks set odds and lines?\n\nThe best sportsbooks employ oddsmakers and oddsmaking services to set their lines and odds.\n\nOther sports betting apps simply copy those lines. The oddsmakers and oddsmaking services use computer models and algorithms that consider analytics, statistics, injury and roster news, performance, matchup data, and more to develop the lines and odds.\n\nBetting lines and odds are then subject to change based on the betting public\u2019s reaction and any additional information that comes to light ahead of the game. Sportsbooks will move the line or change the odds if the public bets heavily on one side.\n\nEvery sportsbook\u2019s goal is to even out the betting on both sides of every bet. That allows sportsbooks to earn the profit built into the odds and lines without worrying about which side wins.\n\nThe betting is rarely the same at every sportsbook. While one sportsbook may be forced to move a line or change the odds because of betting, another won\u2019t. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll spot a difference between sportsbooks. This difference may allow you to book a bet at improved odds or a more favorable line.\n\nThe lines and odds may even be different right from the jump. Either way, the differences are why line shopping always makes sense. Shop around, and you can find opportunities to lay less, win more, and improve your chances.\n\nSee more: How to bet on sports in the US\n\nShop for the best lines at online sportsbooks\n\nBelow is a live odds feed that shows you the differences between lines and odds for the same bets at many of the top sportsbooks in the country. Look here for current opportunities.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to shop lines?\n\nThe easiest way to line-shop is to find something like the live odds feed above. It\u2019s a one-stop shop. Shopping lines here will take just seconds.\n\nPerforming the task manually may take longer, but you can check with more sportsbooks or the chosen few you feel consistently offer the best lines and odds. The best way to do this is to download and install more than one of the best sports betting apps on your phone.\n\nThen, tap around among the sportsbooks to compare lines and odds for the bets you plan.\n\nBest sportsbooks for line shopping\n\nThe biggest brands in sports betting offer competitive lines in dozens of states. Shop around at the following top online sportsbooks to find the best prices on your bets.\n\nCaesars Sportsbook\n\nCaesars' odds and lines are consistently among the best in the country, making it a must-see when shopping lines. The point spreads here can be a half-point to two points better than the competition\u2019s, and the moneyline odds may be more favorable.\n\nBetMGM Sportsbook\n\nThe lines and odds at BetMGM are consistently competitive. Plus, sports betting promos and odds boosts abound, so you'll find a better price on many bets here.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook\n\nDraftKings has more open betting markets than most online sportsbooks, and the lines and odds are always competitive.\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook\n\nFanDuel is committed to posting competitive odds and runs so many generous promos and odds boosts that it is always worth a look.\n\nHow to find the best lines and odds for any bet\n\nShopping around lets you find the best lines and odds for any bet. That means checking the posted lines and odds for the same bets at different sportsbooks.\n\nYou can do this for moneylines, point spreads, totals bets, prop bets, and more. Finding the best line or better odds on any bet is like finding money.\n\nYou can shop around using multiple sportsbook apps on your phone or live odds feeds like the one above. Pick a side, then use the drop-down menus and tabs to find the odds and lines for that bet.\n\nFinally, bet when you see an opportunity at better odds or an improved line compared to the competition.\n\nLine shopping for futures\n\nPeople tend to bet futures at their favorite online sportsbook. However, shopping for better odds on any future bet is worth your time. Most game lines are similar at different sportsbooks, but the odds in futures markets can vary significantly.\n\nSportsbooks sometimes have higher liabilities for specific teams and offer better odds on others to lay that off. Timing is everything.\n\nGet it right, and you can easily take advantage of changes in different futures markets due to liability. However, the only way to find these opportunities is shopping lines.\n\nSee more: NFL futures bets\n\nCan I get a better line or odds after I\u2019ve already bet?\n\nWhen you bet, you lock in the odds or line as currently posted. If they change, for better or worse, you\u2019re stuck with the odds from when you wagered.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely why you should go line shopping before you bet. Of course, if significant changes occur, you can take more action at the improved odds or more favorable line.\n\nIs line shopping worth my time?\n\nBecause it can provide you the opportunity to lay less, win more, and improve your chances, line shopping is certainly worth your time. Plus, it doesn\u2019t have to take up all that much of it.\n\nUse the live odds feed above to do a basic survey. You\u2019ll find it takes just seconds to compare lines and odds. Plus, download and install multiple licensed online sportsbook apps on your phone, and you can do a more thorough shop in just a few minutes.\n\nGetting more points or laying fewer on a typical NFL point spread or NBA point spread might lead to winning a bet you\u2019d otherwise lose. Plus, if you find better odds on any bet, you can potentially drop fewer dollars when you lose and earn more when you win.\n\nShopping lines will help you consistently find the best prices on your bets. It won't help you pick more winners, but it will improve your chances and lead to bigger wins and more affordable losses. That\u2019s undoubtedly worth your time.\n\nFor example, you might like the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Cincinnati Bengals in a mid-season NFL game. Say you look around and see that three of four licensed online sportsbooks in your state have the Chiefs as -3 favorites, but the fourth has them at just -2.5.\n\nLet\u2019s say the Chiefs win by exactly three, a distinct possibility since a single field goal decides most NFL games. Bets at the first three sportsbooks would push. However, you\u2019d have a winner at the fourth. If you didn\u2019t shop around, you\u2019d never have found that half-point victory and be stuck with a push instead of a profit.\n\nWhat is the Vegas line?\n\nLas Vegas sportsbooks set the standard for lines and odds across the country. If a sportsbook is copying a line, it\u2019s usually copying the Vegas line. Most online betting sites don\u2019t stray too far from the Vegas line, using it as a foundation for setting all lines in every major sport.\n\nIf those lines do shift, it\u2019s usually because of increased betting on one side of a bet. Shop lines locally, and you can take advantage when sportsbooks stray from the Vegas line.\n\nWhy do the lines move?\n\nIt\u2019s worth reiterating that sportsbooks want an equal amount of money bet on each side of every bet. When that happens, they earn the small profit built into the odds without concern about who wins or loses.\n\nSportsbooks want even betting so much that they\u2019ll move a line or change the odds to draw more bets to the other side to get it that way.\n\nThat\u2019s when you\u2019ll see a difference between the lines and odds. Every sportsbook jumps on board when a line moves or odds change for a legitimate reason, like an injury or roster move. It\u2019ll be difficult for you to find value in that case.\n\nBut when a line moves or odds change because of betting patterns, only the sportsbook that saw the betting makes the change. That\u2019s your opportunity right there.\n\nLine shopping is a tool to help you spot changes due to betting patterns. Then, you can simply take advantage of movement in a line or changes in the odds.\n\nChoose a side, shop around at online sportsbooks, compare the lines and odds, and then pounce when you find one that has something different and more favorable to your viewpoint.\n\nSee more: What is a parlay bet?"

    "body": "The primary draw of the moneyline bet lies in its simplicity. Even those just dipping their toes into the world of sports betting for the first time can quickly get a handle on the basics of the moneyline.\n\nOn this page we'll unpack the ins and outs of moneyline betting in more detail.\n\nWhat is a moneyline bet?\n\nSo, what's the essence of a moneyline bet? In this type of bet, the sole focus is identifying the winner.\n\nThe victory margin and the total points scored have no bearing. It doesn't matter if your chosen team clinches a win with a score of 2-1 or a blowout of 50-0; the payout remains unchanged.\n\nIn this way, the moneyline distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor.\n\nEvery moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. In the context of moneyline betting, \"favorites\" and \"underdogs\" refer to the perceived stronger and weaker participants, respectively.\n\nFavorites:\n\nThe favorite is the participant (be it a team or an individual) who is expected to win the event or matchup.\n\nIn moneyline odds, especially in American odds format, the favorite is usually represented with a minus (-) sign. For instance, if Team A is a favorite and is listed at -150, a bettor would need to wager $150 to win $100.\n\nUnderdogs:\n\nThe underdog is the participant deemed less likely to win compared to the opponent.\n\nUnderdogs in moneyline odds, particularly in the American odds format, are usually represented with a plus (+) sign. If Team B is an underdog and has odds of +130, a bettor would win $130 for every $100 they bet, should Team B win.\n\nMoneyline odds formats\n\nYou'll typically encounter three types of odds when researching and handicapping across various platforms\u2014decimal, fractional, and American.\n\nMost listings on the best online sports betting sites predominantly use American Odds.\n\nAmerican Odds\n\nYou'll usually see these displayed as either a negative (-) or positive (+) number, symbolizing different implications in the betting world.\n\nThe negative numbers might seem a bit perplexing at first. They point to the team, player, or option considered the favorite to win.\n\nThis number can also represent wagers that are less than even money. Essentially, the negative figure tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit of $100. We'll clarify with an example shortly.\n\nConversely, positive odds signal the underdog in the betting scenario or bets that offer more than even money. This figure shows how much profit you'll make on a $100 wager.\n\nTo illustrate with a moneyline bet: Imagine on a top NFL betting site the New England Patriots are listed as -110 favorites, while the New York Jets stand at +250.\n\nYou decide to back the favorite and bet $110 on the Pats. The Pats win, and you end up with $210.\n\nThat sum comprises your initial $110 bet and the $100 profit you've earned.\n\nFractional Odds\n\nWhile you might occasionally encounter these odds, especially in contexts like horse racing, they're quite straightforward once you get the hang of them, even if they initially seem like a math problem.\n\nThese odds typically look like two numbers separated by a slash (/) or a dash (-), resembling a fraction. For instance, you might see 5/1 or 5-1.\n\nHere's a simple way to interpret fractions: the first number (akin to the numerator in math) represents potential profit, while the second (akin to the denominator) indicates the amount you need to stake.\n\nIn other words, the denominator tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit equivalent to the numerator.\n\nFor example, with 2/1 odds, you'd earn $2 for every $1 you wager. Conversely, with 4/9 odds, a bet of $9 would yield a $4 profit.\n\nTo further illustrate, if you placed a bet of $9 at 4/9 odds and won, you'd receive $13 in total: your initial $9 stake plus the $4 profit.\n\nDecimal Odds\n\nDecimals are to betting what the metric system is to measurements: straightforward and user-friendly. They present fewer intricacies compared to their American and fractional counterparts.\n\nHowever, just as the metric system is not universally embraced in the US, decimal odds can also be overlooked there.\n\nFortunately, working with decimal odds is simple. To determine a bet's payout, you multiply the decimal odds by the amount you're betting.\n\nFor instance, if the odds on an NHL betting site have the Edmonton Oilers at 2.53 to beat the Detroit Red Wings, a $10 bet would yield a $25.30 return. This includes your initial $10 wager, along with a profit of $15.30.\n\nIt's essential to note that this calculation gives you the total payout, not just your earnings. If you're keen on tracking your profits from betting, remember to subtract your original stake from the payout to get an accurate figure.\n\nWhy do moneyline odds change?\n\nLines at the best sports betting apps change quickly due to two primary reasons:\n\nPublic betting\n\nNew information\n\nBefore setting odds for an event, oddsmakers gather extensive data. Once they finalize the odds, they release them to the public.\n\nAs a bettor, you can bet immediately or wait for potential shifts in the odds, although predicting these shifts is challenging.\n\nFor instance, when examining odds for the next Super Bowl champion released shortly after the previous Super Bowl, these odds are based mostly on the recently concluded season.\n\nAs the new season approaches and teams make changes, odds adjust based on perceived championship chances. As games progress, lines continue to evolve based on team performances.\n\nPublic betting can also sway lines. If too many wagers favor one outcome, sportsbooks adjust the odds to balance the bets. This ensures an even distribution of bets and reduces the sportsbook's financial risk.\n\nMoneyline betting outcomes\n\nWhen you\u2019re placing a moneyline wager, several outcomes are possible. The most straightforward outcome is a win or a loss, determined by whether the team or individual you bet on is victorious or defeated.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a draw, which occurs if the event ends in a tie.\n\nMoneyline win\n\nWinning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. All you need to do is pick the team or individual who is going to win an event and choose correctly.\n\nIf you bet on a boxing match between Boxer A and Boxer B, and you've bet on Boxer B to win and he does, then your bet would be successful and you'd get paid based on the odds at the time you placed your wager.\n\nMoneyline loss\n\nWhen placing a moneyline wager, a loss simply means that the team or individual you bet on did not win the event or matchup.\n\nFor example, let's say on an NBA betting site you bet on a basketball game between Team A and Team B. You believe Team A will win, so you place a $100 moneyline wager on them. If Team B wins, your bet on Team A would be a loss.\n\nDraw\n\nIn some sports, notably soccer, games can end in a draw, and bettors have the option to wager on this outcome. When placing a moneyline wager in such situations, you'll typically see three sets of odds: one for each team to win and one for the game to end in a draw.\n\nFor instance, consider a soccer match between Team A and Team B. The moneyline odds might look something like this:\n\nTeam A: +150\n\n+150 Draw: +220\n\n+220 Team B: +180\n\nIf you believe the game will end in a tie, you could place a $100 wager on the \"Draw\" option. If the match indeed concludes with a tied score, you would win based on the +220 odds. This means you'd receive $220 in profit on top of your $100 stake, totaling $320. However, if either Team A or Team B wins, you'd lose your $100 wager.\n\nSee more: Best soccer betting sites\n\nMoneyline betting examples by sport\n\nBelow are some examples of typical moneyline bets you'll find for various professional sports.\n\nMoneyline odds in football\n\nNFL moneyline odds for a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants might look something like this:\n\nDallas Cowboys: -130\n\n-130 New York Giants: +110\n\nHere, the Cowboys are the favorites, indicated by the negative odds. If you bet $130 on the Cowboys and they win, you would earn a profit of $100.\n\nThe New York Giants are the underdogs, as shown by the positive odds. If you wager $100 on the Giants and they pull off an upset victory, you would earn a profit of $110.\n\nMoneyline odds in basketball\n\nNBA moneyline odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat might be presented as:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: -150\n\n-150 Miami Heat: +130\n\nIn this scenario, the Lakers are favored to win, as indicated by the negative odds. If you back the Lakers with a bet of $150 and they win, you would earn a profit of $100.\n\nThe Heat are the underdogs. If you place a $100 bet on the Heat and they win, your profit would be $130.\n\nMoneyline odds in baseball\n\nMLB moneyline odds for a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox might look like this:\n\nNew York Yankees: -120\n\n-120 Boston Red Sox: +100\n\nThe Yankees are slight favorites. If you bet $120 on the Yankees and they win, you'd earn a profit of $100. The Red Sox have even odds, shown by the +100. This means if you bet $100 on the Red Sox and they win, you'd also earn a profit of $100.\n\nMoneyline odds in hockey\n\nNHL moneyline odds for a game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks might be displayed as:\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: -140\n\n-140 Chicago Blackhawks: +120\n\nIf you put down $140 on the Maple Leafs and they win, you would earn a profit of $100. If you bet $100 on the Blackhawks and they pull off a win, you'd receive a profit of $120.\n\nMoneyline odds in soccer\n\nSoccer moneyline odds for an MLS match between the Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United might look like this:\n\nSeattle Sounders: +110\n\n+110 Draw: +230\n\n+230 Atlanta United: +140\n\nIn this scenario, neither team is a clear favorite, but the Seattle Sounders have slightly better odds. If you bet $100 on the Sounders and they win, you'd earn a profit of $110.\n\nIf you believe the match might end in a tie, you could place a bet on the \"Draw\" option. A $100 bet on a draw would result in a $230 profit if the match ends tied.\n\nMeanwhile, if you back Atlanta United with a $100 wager and they win, you'd secure a profit of $140.\n\nRemember, in soccer, the possibility of a draw is a common outcome to bet on, which is different from many other major sports.\n\nMoneyline odds in MMA/UFC\n\nUFC moneyline odds for a fight between Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier might look like this:\n\nConor McGregor: -200\n\n-200 Dustin Poirier: +170\n\nIf you bet $200 on McGregor and he wins the fight, you'd earn a profit of $100. If you bet $100 on Poirier and he wins, you would earn a profit of $170.\n\nMoneyline odds in tennis\n\nTennis odds for a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova might be displayed as:\n\nSerena Williams: -150\n\n-150 Maria Sharapova: +130\n\nIn this hypothetical matchup, Serena is the favorite to win. If you bet $150 on Williams and she wins, you would earn a profit of $100. Sharapova is the underdog. If you place a $100 wager on Sharapova and she manages to win, you'll receive a profit of $130.\n\nMoneyline odds in golf\n\nLet's consider some PGA tour odds at one of the best golf betting sites where you're betting on an individual golfer to win. The moneyline odds might be presented as:\n\nTiger Woods: +500\n\n+500 Rory McIlroy: +600\n\nIn this hypothetical tournament scenario, neither golfer is a strong favorite, but the odds indicate their perceived chances to win. If you decide to bet $100 on Tiger Woods and he wins the tournament, you'd earn a profit of $500.\n\nOn the other hand, if you place a $100 wager on Rory McIlroy and he clinches the tournament victory, you'd secure a profit of $600.\n\nIt's important to note that in PGA and other golf tournaments, there are usually many players, so the odds can be much higher than in head-to-head sports matchups, given the broader field of competition.\n\nMoneyline Betting FAQ\n\nHow do moneyline bets work?\n\nMoneylines hinge on the outright winner of a game or event. They are presented with either a positive (+) or negative (-) sign:\n\nA positive moneyline (+) indicates the underdog and represents the amount of profit on a $100 bet.\n\nA negative moneyline (-) indicates the favorite and shows how much you need to bet to earn a $100 profit.\n\nWhat happens if there\u2019s a tie in a moneyline bet?\n\nIf there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a \"push.\" When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager. No money is won or lost. However, sports that typically have the possibility of a tie (like soccer) often provide bettors with the option to bet on a draw.\n\nIf the game ends in a draw and you haven't bet on that option, you would lose your bet. It's essential to understand the specific rules of the sportsbook and the sport you're betting on to know how ties are handled.\n\nDoes overtime count in my moneyline bet?\n\nYes, in most sports and with most sportsbooks (including new betting sites), overtime (or any extra time or tiebreakers) does count in a moneyline bet.\n\nThat said, always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you're using to ensure you understand their policies.\n\nWhy do moneyline odds change?\n\nMoneyline odds change for several reasons.\n\nPublic Betting Patterns: If a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability. By making the odds less favorable for a heavily-bet team and more favorable for the less-bet team, they can encourage more even betting.\n\nIf a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability.

But you\u2019ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.\n\nConversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.\n\nWhen the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn\u2019t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don\u2019t have the data to craft more specific lines.\n\nOnce the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.\n\nSo, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.\n\nPros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nYou have an opportunity to find better value.\n\nThe betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.\n\nYou\u2019ll find limited information to make an informed bet.\n\nPros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nThere is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.\n\nYou don\u2019t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a reduced opportunity to find value.\n\nThe odds may not be as favorable.\n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.\n\nWho are the past NBA ROTY winners?\n\nFor context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.\n\nSeason Player Position Team 2023 Paolo Banchero Forward Orlando Magic 2022 Scottie Barnes Forward Toronto Raptors 2021 LaMelo Ball Guard Charlotte Hornets 2020 Ja Morant Guard Memphis Grizzlies 2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Guard/Forward Dallas Mavericks 2018 Ben Simmons Forward/Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2017 Malcolm Brogdon Guard Milwaukee Bucks 2016 Karl-Anthony Towns Center Minnesota Timberwolves 2015 Andrew Wiggins Forward/Guard Minnesota Timberwolves 2014 Michael Carter-Williams Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2013 Damian Lillard Guard Portland Trail Blazers 2012 Kyrie Irving Guard Cleveland Cavaliers 2011 Blake Griffin Forward Los Angeles Clippers 2010 Tyreke Evans Guard/Forward Sacramento Kings\n\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\n\nRookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:\n\nIn addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you\u2019ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.\n\nThe NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds.

    "body": "13 Dec 2023 02.36 GMT James Wallace That\u2019s it from me this evening/morning. Time to haul myself out of the OBO armchair and skulk off for some kip. That was an intriguing game and sets up this T20I series nicely. A real statement has been laid down by Rovman Powell and his men, West Indies were up against it early doors with England crunching their way to 112-2 off the first ten overs but Jos Buttler\u2019s side only managed to make 59 runs off the next ten, losing eight wickets along the way. A total of 171 was thirty or more shy of where England would have liked to have ended up and so it proved as West Indies peeled up their sleeves and showed how muscular their own batting card is \u2013 the home side cleared the ropes fourteen times compared to England\u2019s six. Andre Russell and Rovman Powell found the stands with ease at the business end of the match to get West Indies over the line with eleven balls remaining. We\u2019ll be back to cover the second match in Grenada on Thursday, do join us for that. Until then, thank you and goodnight.\n\nUpdated at 02.36 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.28 GMT Andre Russell is Player of the Match: In his first T20I in over two years he took 3-29 and smashed 29* off just 14 deliveries with the game in the balance. He seems very pleased to be back in maroon. Life is so funny. Since when I got selected for the West Indies two weeks ago I\u2019ve been dreaming of being man of the match.\u201d\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.09 GMT West Indies win by 4 wickets! Andre Russell smashes the winning runs off Sam Curran! A length ball is spanked over point for a one bounce four to give the home side the win, they go 1-0 up in the series.\n\nUpdated at 02.29 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.07 GMT 18th over: West Indies 168-6 (Powell 31, Russell 25) Adil Rashid is recalled for his final over, can he turn the game back to England? Nope. ANDRE RUSSELL SMASHES THE RASHID GOOGLY CLEAN OUT OF THE GROUND! Huge SIX! The big man even allows himself a coy smile. He enjoyed that one. A dot the next ball is followed by a powerful drive all along the baize for four! Eleven in total off the over and West Indies now just need four runs.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.01 GMT 17th over: West Indies 157-6 (Powell 31, Russell 14) Tymal Mills is entrusted. Singles off the first two balls. Powell swipes a full ball into the deep to collect a couple. SIX! Mills goes short and Powell gets a mighty top edge for a maximum! Fortune favours the brave, the Windies skipper gave that everything and it could have gone anywhere. Mills sends one down the leg side \u2013 wide ball. Pressure on the bowler here\u2026 Shot! Short and wide from Mills and sent to the fence with Swiss clock timing by Powell. Sixteen off the over, looking terminal for Buttler and co. 15 needed from 18 balls.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.55 GMT 16th over: West Indies 141-6 (Powell 26, Russell 4) Livingstone continues. Four singles off the first four balls keeps the pressure on the West Indies. HOLD THAT THOUGHT. Rovman Powell crunches consecutive sixes down the ground with a shrug and swagger to make it sixteen off the over. The scales tip once more, England need to do away with one or both of Powell and Russell \u2013 there\u2019s no way they don\u2019t win this for West Indies if they are there at the end. 31 needed from 24 balls.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.51 GMT 15th over: West Indies 125-6 (Powell 12, Russell 2) Andre Russell the man to face the hattrick ball\u2026 Boo! A decent ball on the stumps is patted back by the big man. Drama in Barbados, Russell works for a couple. Ahmed takes his cap with a broad smile on his face \u2013 he hasn\u2019t had it all his own way but finishes with 3-39 from his set of four. Advantage England? 47 needed from 30 balls.\n\nUpdated at 01.54 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.47 GMT WICKET! Shepherd c Curran b Rehan Ahmed 0 (West Indies 123-6) Rehan Ahmed on a hattrick! Buttler brings Curran into slip and Shepherd pokes a leggie to him off his very first ball. Great stuff from Rehan who has turned the game England\u2019s way in the space of a minute.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.45 GMT WICKET! Shai Hope c Brook b Rehan Ahmed 36 (West Indies 123-5) Ahmed is bunted for SIX by Shai Hope but strikes with the next ball as Hope holes out!\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.44 GMT 14th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Liam Livingstone instead of Rashid and he does well to keep it to singles, England trying to take this as deep as possible and hope West Indies fluff their lines at the death. West Indies need 55 from 36 balls.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.41 GMT 13th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Rehan has two balls left to complete his over. The first ball is flayed for four by Powell behind point! Valuable runs for West Indies. Rehan\u2019s final ball is a dot, defended by Powell into the off side. West Indies need 60 from 42 balls.\n\nUpdated at 01.42 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.30 GMT Simon Burnton is our man in Barbados and he sends good news! \u201cIt\u2019s a 9.35pm restart. We haven\u2019t lost any overs.\u201d We should be underway in about eight minutes. I believe that 10.10pm local time is the cut off for the match \u2013 that\u2019ll be 2.10am here in London town. Excuse me whilst I head to the kitchen to microdose some Kenco.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.14 GMT Promising news \u2013 the rain seems to be tailing off and a rope is being dragged around the outfield to take off any excess water. I\u2019ll bring news as soon as it wafts over from Barbados to my sofa.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.00 GMT Rain stops play (West Indies 108-4 and require 64 runs off 44 balls) What\u2019s all this then? Out of nowhere the heavens crack like an inky br\u00fbl\u00e9e and rain starts to pour. The players scurry off as the covers are hauled on. Crucially \u2013 West Indies are six runs ahead of the Duckworth Lewis Stern rate. IF the rain doesn\u2019t abate \u2013 and it looks heavy at the moment \u2013 then the home side will take the spoils. 12.4 overs: West Indies 108-4 (Hope 27, Powell 6)\n\nUpdated at 01.09 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.58 GMT 12th over: West Indies 102-4 (Hope 26, Hetmyer 1) Just a single and the wicket off the over, Shai Hope can\u2019t break the legspin shackles. Windies skipper Rovman Powell is the new man and Buttler cranks the pressure by inserting a slip.\n\nUpdated at 01.04 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.52 GMT WICKET! Hetmyer c Duckett b Rashid 1 (West Indies 101-4) Adil Rashid takes his 100th T20I wicket! A crucial one in the context of the game too \u2013 the dangerous Hetmyer is sent on his way for just a single as England look to ramp up the pressure heading into the nub end of this match. Hetmyer danced out of his crease and got a good piece of the length ball but it flew flat and hard to Duckett on the midwicket sponge. And he does it on his 100th T20I appearance! \ud83d\udcaf#BBCCricket #WIvENG pic.twitter.com/LYhUBtNnUj \u2014 Test Match Special (@bbctms) December 13, 2023\n\nUpdated at 01.02 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.49 GMT WICKET! Pooran c & b Rehan Ahmed 13 (West Indies 100-3) Rehan back into the attack after his first over was minced for n n n n nineteen. Got him! Pooran flicks back a full ball and Rehan takes a nifty catch tumbling away to his left. Shimron Hetymer is the new batter and he tucks a single into the leg side to open his account. The wicket has given Ahmed a confidence boost and he gets out of the over with three dots. 11th over: West Indies 101-3 (Hope 25, Hetmyer 1)\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.43 GMT 10th over: West Indies 99-2 (Hope 25, Pooran 13) Rashid is given another after his excellent first over. The googly is spotted by Pooran and driven down the ground handsomely for SIX! A glide behind point bring a single, Hope returns the favour with a flick into the leg side. A short ball is panned into the deep by Pooran for a couple to end the over. Bon Jovi O\u2019clock \u2013 West Indies need 73 from 60. Time for a quick slurp for the players and a knuckle stretch for me. Is there anybody alive out there?!\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.37 GMT 9th over: West Indies 87-2 (Hope 23, Pooran 3) Will the wickets slow the Windies as they did England? Rehan is replaced by Tymal Mills who starts with another wide. Rusty stuff so far from the southpaw seamer. That\u2019s better \u2013 a series of slower balls and back of the hand trickery restricts Pooran and Hope before the final ball is top edged over Buttler\u2019s head for a one bounce four. West Indies need 85 from 66 balls.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.32 GMT WICKET! Kyle Mayers c Brook b Rashid 35 (West Indies 79-3) The sorcerer follows his apprentice and bags a wicket first ball! That\u2019s Rashid\u2019s 99th T20I wicket \u2013 in truth it was a bit of a drag down but from the front of the hand so it skidded onto Mayers who didn\u2019t time it and was caught by Brook in the deep. England needed that BIG TIME. A masterclass from Rashid in the rest of the over, Nicholas Pooran is the new man and his clip for one is the only run from the over. 8th over: West Indies 79-2 (Hope 19, Pooran 1)\n\nUpdated at 00.56 GMT\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.28 GMT 7th over: West Indies 78-1 (Mayers 35, Hope 19) Rehan to Kyle Mayers. First ball is dragged down and launched over the midwicket boundary for SIX. Pressure on the young leggie. What a shot! Mayers holds the pose as he lofts a supreme drive down the ground for SIX more. Brutal elegance. Rehan comes back well with two sharply turning leggies. Bosh! Shai Hope gets in on the act and smears a length ball over mid on for the third six of the over. It\u2019s a learning curve for the tyro spinner but that doesn\u2019t make it any less bruising.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.23 GMT 6th over: West Indies 59-1 (Mayers 22, Hope 13) Curran is called back, Mills granted just the one over for the time being. Two slower balls bring two soothing dots for England. A single each to Mayers and Hope. Curran does very well to get out of the over with just three runs conceded. Powerplay complete. How long till we see some spin from Rehan? Not long at all, he\u2019s on for the next over.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.20 GMT 5th over: West Indies 56-1 (Mayers 20, Hope 12) Woakes continues, after five balls he\u2019s gone for just three runs. Can he get out of the over cheaply? No \u2013 A length ball is clubbed down the ground for SIX with a minimum of fuss by Shai Hope. West Indies have come out of the traps as well as England did, one over of the Powerplay left.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.16 GMT 4th over: West Indies 47-1 (Mayers 18, Hope 5) Tymal Mills comes onto bowl for England for the first time in eighteen months, he has plenty of T20 skills up his sleeve, can he showcase them here? Hmmm, a couple of wides slanted down the leg side isn\u2019t the best of starts. Mills lets out a hearty groan at the second. Two full balls are worked for singles\u2026 Kablammo! Mills to Mayers \u2013 short ball \u2013 pulled onto the roof for SIX! What a shot, new ball please! DROP! And it is Ben Duckett who shells it! It would have been even better than the first grab but the ball smashes into his palm as he leaps to his right and comes straight out. They stick or they don\u2019t. It\u2019s all happening.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.10 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 36-1 (Mayers 10, Hope 4) Shai Hope is the new man and digs out a Woakes yorker and somehow manages to crunch it away down the ground for four. The replay of the Duckett catch is extremely enjoyable, Woakes owes him one for that as it was a poor ball outside off stump.\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.07 GMT WICKET! Brandon King c Duckett b Woakes 22 (West Indies 32-1) Chris Woakes into the attack to replace the beleaguered Sam Curran. OH. MY. LORDY. Ben Duckett flies to his left at backward point to pull off a spectacular diving catch off a full blooded cut shot from King. Stunner!\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.03 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 30-0 (King 21, Mayers 9) Will Jacks to bowl his workmanlike spin at the other end. Uh-Oh! He drops short and Kyle Mayers murders it, the ball lands on the roof of the stadium. That deserved everything it got. Mayers cuts for three behind point and then King skips jauntily out of his crease to skim the ball for four down the ground!\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.59 GMT 1st over: West Indies 16-0 (King 16, Mayers) Brandon King gets the home side off to a blistering start, sending Sam Curran down the ground for four and swiping a brace of SIXES over mid-wicket. Game on!\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.56 GMT No sooner have I sploshed some water on me teabag\u2026 the players emerge. West Indies need 172 to win!\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.48 GMT An innings of two halves for England From 77 for no loss to 171 all out with three balls to spare. England's recent white ball approach is a variable one yielding mixed...often frustrating results #WIvENG \u2014 Aatif Nawaz (@AatifNawaz) December 12, 2023\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.47 GMT Time to stick the kettle on and raid the fridge before West Indies start their chase. 3-19 for Andre Russell on his comeback for West Indies, balancing the attack perfectly.\n\n\n\nRussell at his best adds so much to West Indies's side. With him at 7, and Holder, Shepherd and Hosein to follow, West Indies bat incredibly deep \u2014 Tim Wigmore (@timwig) December 12, 2023\n\nUpdated at 23.48 GMT\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.46 GMT England all out 171! Tymal Mills gets a gossamer thin edge through to Pooran and England are all out with three deliveries to spare! What a turnaround for West Indies who were staring down the barrel with England flying 77-0 after six overs.\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.44 GMT WICKET! Rashid b Joseph 0 (England 170-9) Rashid goes to swipe Joseph in the final over and hacks the ball onto his timbers. England nine down\u2026\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.42 GMT WICKET! Ahmed c Powell b Russell 1 (England 169-8) Rehan Ahmed follows shortly after, trying to smear a length ball down the ground he can only find Powell lurking ten yards in from the sponge. Russell gets two in the over and finishes his spell and his first T20I in two years with figures of 3-19. Nicely done. 19th over: England 169-8 (Woakes 2, Rashid 0)\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.37 GMT WICKET! Livingstone b Russell 27 (England 167-7) Livingstone chops a cutter from Russell onto his stumps!\n\n"

    "body": "6d ago 23.36 GMT Jos Buttler\u2019s reaction We probably didn\u2019t adapt quickly enough with the bat \u2013 I thought 16o w0uld have been a decent score on a used wicket. It was a fantastic bowling effort; we did well to hang in the game as long as we did. Phil Salt has had a brilliant series. We found out lots about ourselves as a team. [On the stop-clock experiment] It was only in the last game that we really noticed it. It\u2019s good to keep the game moving.\n\n\n\n6d ago 23.19 GMT England\u2019s miserable white-ball year ends with another series defeat. Plenty of good has come from this series, though, most notably the performance of Phil Salt. While there are a few slots to fill, most notably at No3, they are in reasonable shape ahead of nexr year\u2019s World Cup.\n\nUpdated at 23.20 GMT\n\n6d ago 23.16 GMT I suppose it\u2019s appropriate that it ended with a six, the 120th of the series. Hope played a gem of an innings there, calmly anchoring West Indies in an increasingly nervous chase with a run-a-ball 43. England fought admirably to defend a below-par total; but for Hope, they would probably have done it.\n\nUpdated at 23.17 GMT\n\n6d ago 23.14 GMT WEST INDIES WIN THE SERIES 3-2! 19.2 overs: West Indies 133-6 (Hope 43, Holder 4) That\u2019s it! Hope pings Woakes over extra cover for six to seal another series victory for West Indies!

It would have been four but for an outstanding stop from Rehan Ahmed.\n\n\n\n6d ago 23.12 GMT 19th over; West Indies 124-6 (Hope 37, Holder 1) Holder is almost run out first ball! He took a very dodgy single to mid-off and was well short of the crease when Curran just failed to gather Rashid\u2019s throw. Nine to win from six balls, Chris Woakes to bowl them.\n\n\n\n6d ago 23.10 GMT WICKET! West Indies 123-6 (Russell c Livingstone b Curran 3) Oh my. Russell slugs a low full toss straight down the throat of Livingstone at long-on, and England \u2013 who have been behind the game throughout this innings \u2013 are again dreaming of an improbable victory. West Indies need 10 from 7 balls.\n\n\n\n6d ago 23.09 GMT 18.4 overs: West Indies 123-5 (Hope 37, Russell 3) Sam Curran concedes only one run from the first four balls of a superb penultimate over. The ball is getting very wet, though, so there\u2019s a short break in play while England call for a dry towel. West Indies need 10 from 8 balls.\n\n\n\n6d ago 23.04 GMT 18th over: West Indies 122-5 (Hope 36, Russell 3) Jos Buttler gambles by continuing with Rehan Ahmed, who has been relatively expensive. It doesn\u2019t come off: Hope skims a back cut between short third and backward point for four to move the requirement back below a run a ball. It\u2019s very hard to see how England can with this now.\n\n\n\n6d ago 23.00 GMT 17th over: West Indies 114-5 (Hope 30, Russell 1) The wicket England really need is that of Shai Hope, who is quietly guiding West Indies towards the finish line.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.57 GMT WICKET! West Indies 113-5 (Powell c Rashid b Topley 8) England haven\u2019t given this up. Powell edges Topley to short third man, where Rashid takes a smart low catch to his left. West Indies need 20 from 21 balls. Reece Topley (right) celebrates the dismissal of Rovman Powell. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 23.07 GMT\n\n6d ago 22.54 GMT 16th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 29, Powell 8) Hope, who is playing an exemplary innings, opens the face to steer Rehan for his first boundary. Rehan has struggled as the series has progressed, an d later in the over Powell muscles him over long-on for six. West Indies are 21 runs away from a hat-trick of T20 series wins this year: South Africa away, India and England at home.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.50 GMT 15th over: West Indies 99-4 (Hope 23, Powell 1) Rashid finishes with figures of 4-0-21-2. He\u2019s had a great series: eight wickets at 15 with an absurd economy rate of 6.26. But he\u2019s going to end on the losing side.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.48 GMT WICKET! West Indies 95-4 (Rutherford c Curran b Rashid 30) Buttler brings back Rashid for his final over, knowing it\u2019s now or never for England, and gets an immediate reward. Rutherford smashes a drive towards short extra, where Curran dives to his left to take a superb catch. It\u2019s not the despair, Laura\u2026\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.45 GMT 14th over: West Indies 94-3 (Hope 19, Rutherford 30) West Indies are rushing towards a series victory. Rutherford hooks the new bowler Sam Curran for six more, and there are 11 from the over in total. Rutherford has 30 from 23 balls, Hope 19 from 28. They\u2019re playing their roles to perfection.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.40 GMT 13th over: West Indies 83-3 (Hope 17, Rutherford 21) Rehan Ahmed returns, perhaps in the hope of tempting Rutherford into one big shot too many. Instead it\u2019s Shai Hope, who is happily playing the anchor role, who faces five of the six deliveries. England are running out of time.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.37 GMT 12th over: West Indies 80-3 (Hope 15, Rutherford 20) England appeal unsuccessfully for caught behind when Rutherford misses a swipe at Rashid. There\u2019s only one review left and they decide not to risk it. A good job too; there was nothing on UltraEdge. Out of nothing Rutherford launches a full ball from Rashid down the ground for six, almost knocking himself off his feet in the process. West Indies are managing an awkward chase pretty well.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.33 GMT 11th over: West Indies 71-3 (Hope 14, Rutherford 12) After 23 balls without a West Indian boundary, Rutherford lifts Moeen handsomely over extra cover for four. That\u2019s an excellent shot which keeps West Indies in control of the run-chase.\n\nUpdated at 22.33 GMT\n\n6d ago 22.28 GMT 10th over: West Indies 62-3 (Hope 12, Rutherford 5) West Indies know how dangerous Rashid is and are content to sit on him. I think that was Charles\u2019 plan as well, but then he saw a low full toss and his brain went rogue. Time for drinks, after which West Indies need 71 from 60 balls.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.25 GMT Rutherford is not out! I need someone else\u2019s glasses: it was comfortably missing leg stump and England have lost a review.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.25 GMT ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST RUTHERFORD! This looks really close. Rutherford pushed around a legbreak from Rashid and was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.24 GMT 9th over: West Indies 58-3 (Hope 11, Rutherford 2) Moeen replaces Rehan and rushes through a pretty good over, four singles from it. West Indies are still on top but another wicket would make things very interesting.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.21 GMT WICKET! West Indies 54-3 (Charles c Buttler b Rashid 27) Adil Rashid strikes straight away. On this occasion it had nothing to do with his bowling, but maybe a little to do with his aura. He accidentally bowled a very wide, dipping full toss to Charles, who clunked it low to Jos Buttler at short extra cover. Adil Rashid (right) celebrates the dismissal of Johnson Charles (left). Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 22.43 GMT\n\n6d ago 22.17 GMT 7th over: West Indies 51-2 (Charles 26, Hope 7) Rehan Ahmed\u2019s first over disappears for 12. It started quite gently, with four singles and a two off the first five balls, but then Charles clattered a no-nonsense straight six. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win this, Rob,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cBut I\u2019m just here to say I\u2019m still watching for Woakes\u2019 seam position and Rehan\u2019s googly. That is all.\u201d\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.13 GMT 6th over: West Indies 39-2 (Charles 16, Hope 5) Charles mistimes a short ball from Woakes just short of Moeen in the covers. In the end Moeen does well to save the boundary. This has been a good fightback by England, with only nine runs scored in the last three overs.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.09 GMT 5th over: West Indies 37-2 (Charles 15, Hope 4) Topley continues, which makes sense because the spinners will be doing most of the work after the Powerplay, and concedes only three runs. He has quietly had a good series and is comfortably the most economical seamer on either side.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.05 GMT 4th over: West Indies 34-2 (Charles 15, Hope 1) England needed early wickets to have a realistic chance of victory. One more in the Powerplay, before they bring on Adil Rashid, would put them right back in the game.\n\n\n\n6d ago 22.03 GMT WICKET! West Indies 33-2 (Pooran b Woakes 10) UltraEdge shows Pooran did edge that ball from Topley \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t matter because Woakes has got him! Pooran tried to ride the bounce of an awkward delivery that cramped him for room, took the inside of an angled bat and ricocheted onto the stumps. Nicholas Pooran looks glum as his bails go flying. Photograph: Ricardo Mazal\u00e1n/AP\n\nUpdated at 22.15 GMT\n\n6d ago 21.59 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 30-1 (Charles 13, Pooran 9) Nicholas Pooran strolls to the crease and launches his second ball over midwicket for six. And why not. England thought he had edged the next ball to the keeper, though eventually they ran out of time to review. West Indies need 103 from 17 overs. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cJolly exciting this game, in a damaged sort of way. It occurs to me perhaps T20 internationals need a complete rebrand. May I propose we rename them Ecky Thump. The term was Introduced in Kung Fu Kapers, a 1975 episode of BBC comedy The Goodies. In the episode, \u2018ecky thump\u2019 is a secret Lancastrian martial art using black puddings as a weapon. I\u2019m not suggesting we go as far introducing black puddings immediately. A phased withdrawal of the cricket bat will cause less fuss.\u201d But what would you call The Hundred? Bloody Eck?\n\nUpdated at 22.00 GMT\n\n6d ago 21.54 GMT WICKET! West Indies 20-1 (King c Buttler b Topley 3) One down, nine to go. Brandon King slogs Topley miles in the air towards mid-on, where Buttler takes a simple catch. Jos Buttler takes the catch to dismiss Brandon King, and the first West Indies wicket is gone. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images King traipses off the pitch. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 22.14 GMT\n\n6d ago 21.54 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (King 3, Charles 13) Johnson Charles was playher of the match when West Indies beat England at the T20 World Cup 11 years ago. Charles walloped 84 off 56 balls that day, and he looks like he fancies something similar here. He pulls Woakes for a big six, albeit with a hint of top-edge, and glides a boundary past short third man. West Indies are off to a flyer.\n\n\n\n6d ago 21.49 GMT 1st over: West Indies 7-0 (King 1, Charles 2) There\u2019s some early inswing to the right-handers for Reece Topley. Brandon King survives an LBW appeal first ball \u2013 it was missing leg \u2013 before another inswinger to Johnson Charles runs away for four leg-byes. Every boundary hurts when the target is so low, even in the first over.\n\n\n\n6d ago 21.45 GMT After a very short break, the players are back on the field.\n\n\n\n6d ago 21.39 GMT The difference two days make Tuesday, Tarouba England 267-3, 19 sixes\n\nThursday, Taroura England 132 all out, five sixes\n\nUpdated at 21.45 GMT\n\n6d ago 21.36 GMT WICKET! England 132 all out (Curran c Rutherford b Holder 12) Sam Curran clouts the next ball to long-off to end an increasingly miserable England innings. They were 109 for four after 14 overs, and then the house fell down. West Indies need 133 to win the series.\n\nUpdated at 21.38 GMT\n\n6d ago 21.33 GMT WICKET! England 132-9 (Rashid run out 1) Adil Rashid sacrifices himself, just like in the 2019 World Cup final, so that Curran can stay on strike. Four balls remaining.\n\n\n\n6d ago 21.31 GMT 19th over: England 129-8 (Curran 9, Rashid 1) The hat-trick ball is another attempted yorker that Rashid flicks wide of Russell for a single. He would have had three wickets in four balls had Hosein taken a tricky low chance at third man to dismiss Curran. Russell, who bowled really well, finishes with two for 25.\n\n"

    "body": "For most of the millions of people who get the flu each year in the U.S., the virus brings a few days of fever, body aches and weakness before it goes away.\n\nBut for some, the influenza virus can lead to severe illness, hospitalization \u2014 even death.\n\nAllison Miller knows these risks all too well. This year marks a decade since serious complications from the flu led to a life-changing loss for the Virginia-based communications director.\n\nHAVE A COLD OR FLU? HERE'S HOW TO KNOW IF YOU CAN STILL WORK OUT: \u2018USE THE NECK CHECK\u2019\n\nAt age 33, Miller was a healthy young woman when she came down with a sore throat and headache.\n\nWhen her symptoms got worse, she went into urgent care for a chest X-ray, but it showed nothing alarming.\n\n\"It looked like it was just some sort of run-of-the-mill stuff \u2014 they gave me some prescription cough syrup and said to let them know if it got worse,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nBack at home that night, Miller started feeling worse \u2014 and began having intense back pain .\n\n\"Thinking it was the flu or something I could get over, I kept waiting to turn the corner \u2014 like, this is the worst of it. It'll get better. And clearly that wasn't the case,\" she said.\n\nSKELETONS FROM 1918 FLU PANDEMIC REVEAL CLUES ABOUT THOSE MOST LIKELY TO DIE, STUDY FINDS\n\nThe next morning, when the back pain was causing her to have periodic blackouts, Miller managed to call a friend, who came over and called an ambulance.\n\nThat\u2019s where Miller's memory stops.\n\n\"I remember being loaded into the ambulance \u2014 and then I really don't remember a whole lot after that for about three weeks to a month thereafter,\" she said. \"It just escalated very quickly.\"\n\nAs Miller would later learn, her influenza had caused bilateral bacterial pneumonia \u2014 which affects both lungs and is more severe than viral pneumonia.\n\nThis led to sepsis, which quickly turned to septic shock.\n\n\"All of my organs were shutting down,\" Miller said. \"Within a short amount of time, I was in the ICU and they were doing everything they could. But ultimately, my last best chance was to be put on life support.\"\n\n\"I had missed the memo that flu vaccines were for everyone, and being 33 at the time and otherwise healthy, it didn't even register as something I should consider doing.\"\n\nAfter five days, Miller experienced a rare complication.\n\n\"A known complication of that form of life support is amputation,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Some patients lose blood circulation, and that's what happened to me.\"\n\nUltimately, doctors had to amputate Miller\u2019s left leg above the knee \u2014 all while she was still in a medically induced coma.\n\n\"By the time I came out of it, it had been three weeks. I awoke in a very hazy position \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have a left leg,\" she recalled.\n\nShe spent another two months in the hospital and then had to do weeks of inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nToday, in what Miller refers to as her \"new normal,\" she wears a prosthesis and \u2014 with the help of \"very qualified people\" \u2014 has learned to walk again and to \"navigate the world and all of its terrain.\"\n\nDOCTORS URGE VACCINATIONS AHEAD OF THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON, WHICH COULD BE 'FAIRLY BAD,' EXPERTS SAY\n\nMiller has been able to get back to the things that she loves to do, such as traveling the world, without feeling limited by her disability.\n\n\"It's just different, and I have learned to adapt and adjust,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the amputation, Miller still suffers from permanent lung damage and below-average heart function .\n\n\"There was some permanent organ damage because of the strain of the virus, as it was such a severe case of pneumonia,\" she said. \"I have a terminal lung condition that needs regular treatment.\"\n\nShe added, \"It's manageable, but it's something I will forever deal with.\"\n\nThe experience has given Miller a \"renewed sense of how quickly things could change\" \u2014 and has taught her to be as proactive as possible about her health to prevent a terrible outcome.\n\n\"A viral illness like influenza can set you up for something more serious further on.\"\n\nOverall, Miller said she thinks most people don\u2019t understand how severe the flu can be \u2014 so they don\u2019t recognize the signs that they need immediate medical attention .\n\n\"In my case, it was very quick \u2014 it was within 24 to 48 hours that it went from just coming on, to me being in the hot seat.\"\n\nNow, Miller is looking to spread awareness of the importance of getting the flu vaccine, which she did not get that year.\n\n\"I had missed the memo that flu vaccines were for everyone, and being 33 at the time and otherwise healthy, it didn't even register as something I should consider doing,\" she said.\n\n\"If there's anything you can do proactively to minimize the risk of something that severe happening to you, you absolutely should do it, I think.\"\n\nFLU PREVENTION TIPS FROM FLORIDA'S SURGEON GENERAL: A 'DAY-TO-DAY\u2019 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS KEY\n\nMiller acknowledges that the vaccine doesn\u2019t guarantee that someone won't get the flu, but noted that \"it's more of a continuum, rather than either you're sick or you're not.\"\n\nShe said, \"You still might get it, but you may not end up in the ICU like I did \u2026 Considering the benefits that you could get and what the extreme, worst outcome could be, it is an easy thing to do that is proven to make a tremendous difference for people,\" she added.\n\nIn addition to getting yearly vaccines, Miller takes steps to minimize her exposure and makes healthy lifestyle choices , such as eating nutritious foods and exercising.\n\nDr. Gregg Sylvester, chief health officer at CSL Seqirus, a New Jersey biopharmaceutical company, noted that while Miller\u2019s experience is not typical of most women in her age range, \"it probably occurs more often than we know.\"\n\nThe flu triggers inflammation of the respiratory tract, Sylvester said, which causes it to become irritated and can allow secondary or bacteria to enter.\n\nCOVID-19, FLU AND RSV VACCINES ARE ALL AVAILABLE THIS FALL: SEE WHAT SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AND WHY\n\n\"A viral illness like influenza can set you up for something more serious further on,\" he warned. \"That's why it's so important to get a vaccine.\"\n\nThe more severe complications of flu often are markedly reduced for those who get an influenza vaccine, according to the doctor.\n\n\"You still may end up getting infected , but your symptoms will be milder,\" he said. \"And hopefully, your respiratory tract will be in a little bit better shape.\"\n\nMid-October is the \"perfect time\" to get a flu vaccine, Sylvester said, as he noted that the U.S. is starting to see an upswing in cases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"It's never too late, but it is important to be vaccinated before the season really gets started,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Miller urged, \"don't dismiss the flu as just the flu. It's so much more than that. And it can be life-altering.\"\n\nShe continued, \"If you're sick and the symptoms are severe, don't waste time wondering if you should seek medical attention. Listen to your body \u2014 it\u2019s better to go in proactively, rather than regret it later.\"\n\nSylvester agreed, stressing the need for people to be their own patient advocates.\n\n\"It's important to seek care early, especially if symptoms start to change dramatically,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the 2021-2022 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were nine million illnesses, four million medical visits, 10,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to the flu.\n\nThe CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions."

    "body": "Popular weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic could increase the risk of stomach paralysis as well as several other serious gastrointestinal conditions , according to a study published Thursday in JAMA.\n\nThis was the first large epidemiological (disease-related) study to examine these adverse effects in non-diabetic patients using the drugs specifically for weight loss, per a press release from The University of British Columbia (UBC).\n\nThe risk was linked to all semaglutides, a class of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists \u2014 including Ozempic (prescribed for diabetes management ), Wegovy (prescribed for weight loss), Rybelsus (type 2 diabetes) and Saxenda (weight loss).\n\nOZEMPIC DIABETES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER A FEW REPORTS OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS\n\nStomach paralysis, officially known as gastroparesis, prevents the nerves and muscles in the stomach from moving food into the small intestine, which keeps digestion from occurring, as described on Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website.\n\nIn addition to stomach paralysis, the drugs were linked to a greater risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and bowel obstruction, which prevents food from passing through the small or large intestine, the release stated.\n\nUBC researchers examined the health insurance claim records for approximately 16 million U.S. patients who were prescribed Ozempic, Wegovy or either semaglutide or liraglutide medications across a 14-year span (between 2006 and 2020).\n\nThe researchers could not assess whether the condition was temporary or permanent.\n\nCompared to another weight loss drug , bupropion-naltrexone, those who took a GLP-1 agonist were 3.67 times more likely to develop stomach paralysis, had a 9.09 times higher risk of pancreatitis and were 4.22 times more likely to have bowel obstruction.\n\nOZEMPIC, WEGOVY AND ALL THOSE CRAZY, VIVID DREAMS: IS THERE A CONNECTION?\n\nFor the cases of stomach paralysis, the researchers could not assess whether the condition was temporary or permanent.\n\n\"There are reports from other journalists where they have met patients whose symptoms have not gone away despite stopping the drugs,\" study co-author Dr. Mahyar Etminan, associate professor in the Departments of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences and Medicine at UBC, told Fox News Digital.\n\nThere are medications that can be used to help with the condition, he added.\n\nAlthough these complications were rare, the researchers found them concerning, given that millions of people are using these medications worldwide.\n\nThe number of people in the U.S. using GLP-1 agonists for either diabetes or obesity reached 40 million in 2022, they noted.\n\n\"These drugs are becoming increasingly accessible, and it is concerning that, in some cases, people can simply go online and order these kinds of medications when they may not have a full understanding of what could potentially happen,\" said first author Mohit Sodhi, a graduate of UBC\u2019s experimental medicine program, in the release.\n\nThe number of people in the U.S. using GLP-1 agonists for either diabetes or obesity reportedly reached 40 million in 2022.\n\n\"Given the wide use of these drugs, these adverse events, although rare, must be considered by patients thinking about using them for weight loss.\"\n\nThe researchers recommend that regulatory agencies and drugmakers consider updating the warning labels for their products, which currently don\u2019t include the risk of gastroparesis.\n\n\"This is critical information for patients to know so they can seek timely medical attention and avoid serious consequences,\" said Sodhi.\n\nThe decision about whether to take the drug in spite of these risks will depend on each patient\u2019s individual situation, the researchers said.\n\n\"This decision should be individually assessed,\" said Etminan. \"There are patients where the benefit of the drugs might outweigh the risks (very obese individuals), whereas in other situations (healthy individuals who just want to lose a few pounds), the risks might outweigh the benefits.\"\n\n\"This is critical information for patients to know so they can seek timely medical attention and avoid serious consequences.\"\n\nThe study did have some limitations, the researchers noted.\n\n\"We did not have access to medical charts to ascertain all subjects' medical histories,\" said Etminan. \"Also, we could not look at risk with individual GLP-1 drugs, but this is probably a class effect of these drugs.\"\n\nOZEMPIC-WEGOVY PILL MAY BE ON THE WAY: TRIAL SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS FOR NEW WEIGHT LOSS TABLET\n\nThe researchers also did not determine whether certain groups were at higher risk of this adverse side effect, but Etminan said he suspects that those with preexisting GI conditions might be more susceptible.\n\nCalifornia-based cardiologist Dr. Ernst von Schwarz, author of \"The Secrets of Immortality,\" was not involved in the study but noted that it confirmed a higher prevalence of pancreatitis, gastroparesis and bowel obstruction in patients on GLP-1 agonists.\n\n\"On the other hand, these drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events as shown for Ozempic in 2016 in diabetics and in 2023 for Wegovy,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The achieved weight loss using GLP-1 agonists, as well as the improved glucose control, seem to have significant benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, but patients need to be informed about the relatively small incidence of abdominal side effects as seen in this cohort study,\" said von Schwarz.\n\n\"The benefits on cardiovascular risks , however, appear to outweigh the risks of side effects.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists \"ileus\" as a potential side effect of Ozempic.\n\nIleus is the inability of the intestine (bowel) to contract normally and move waste out of the body, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nIn August, a Louisiana woman sued Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Lilly, which makes another GLP-1 agonist, Mounjaro, claiming that the companies \"downplayed the severity of gastrointestinal events caused by Ozempic and Mounjaro \u2014 never, for example, warning of the risk of gastroparesis (\u2018paralyzed stomach\u2019) or gastroenteritis.\"\n\nThe woman, who used Ozempic for more than a year before switching to Mounjaro last month, alleged she was \"severely injured as a result\" of using both drugs, the suit stated.\n\nIn a statement at the time, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk told FOX Business that gastrointestinal events \"are well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class\" and \"are mild to moderate in severity and of short duration.\"\n\n\"Given the wide use of these drugs, these adverse events, although rare, must be considered by patients thinking about using them for weight loss.\"\n\nThe company provided the below statement to Fox News Digital on Friday, Oct. 6.\n\n\"At Novo Nordisk, patient safety is a top priority. We work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to continuously monitor the safety profile of our medicines. The FDA-approved product labeling for Novo Nordisk\u2019s GLP-1RA medicines indicated for use in weight management (Saxenda and Wegovy) includes information about their potential side effects, including pancreatitis, acute gallbladder disease, ileus and delayed gastric emptying.\"\n\n\"Similar information is included in the product labeling for our GLP-1RA medicines indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Ozempic, Rybelsus and Victoza),\" the statement went on.\n\n\"Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1RA medicines when used consistent with the product labeling and approved indications.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNovo Nordisk continued, \"With respect to the study, as the authors acknowledge, the study has limitations, including potential confounding by indication and by other factors.\"\n\nThe company added, \"It is also important to note that the study analyzed data collected during the period between 2006 and 2020. During this time, Wegovy was not on the market; Saxenda was first approved in December 2014. In addition, Victoza was FDA-approved in January 2010 and Ozempic was FDA-approved in December 2017.\"\n\nDaniella Genovese of Fox News Digital contributed to this report."

We both hope we have many more Christmases to spend together.\"\n\nCOUPLE ADOPTS FLORIDA BABY WHO WAS ABANDONED IN THE WOODS ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER HER BIRTH\n\nEnjoying Christmastime with her oldest child \u2014 and only daughter \u2014 has been a long time coming for Sherri Geerts, 81, of Sunnyvale, California, Geerts told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"It\u2019s a story with a good ending,\" Geerts told Fox News Digital.\n\nFor Bazella, it appeared the search for her birth parents would not be an ordinary one \u2014 but rather an epic journey with numerous twists and turns.\n\nTEXAS SIBLINGS REUNITE IN EMOTIONAL VIDEO AFTER BROTHER SAVES 2-YEAR-OLD SISTER FROM DROWNING\n\nThe process took grit and determination, research and genealogical skills and most of all, a deep-rooted desire to find out where she belonged, Bazella said.\n\n\u2018Spent a lot of time\u2019\n\nBazella first found Geerts, her birth mother, in May 2021, and they met in person in 2022.\n\nBut it was only recently that she actually found the courage to share the story of her decades-long search, she said.\n\n\"I\u2019ve spent a lot of time dealing with the healing part of it,\" Bazella said.\n\n\"I think it kind of gives people hope that miracles are still going on, and the world needs to hear that right now. So that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019ve stepped out and told my story now.\"\n\nHOLOCAUST SURVIVOR IS FINALLY REUNITED WITH THE FAMILY THAT SAVED HIS LIFE\n\nWhen Bazella was five years old, her parents, Walter and Ila Peterson, told her she was adopted.\n\n\"I finally feel at peace with everything, which is really nice.\" \u2014 Diane Bazella\n\nThat was the start of her quest to locate her birth parents, and in the 1980s she did just that.\n\nBazella spent the next 39 years trying to bond with the woman whose name appeared on her birth certificate as well as those she thought were her biological family.\n\n\"I'm thinking I found my birth parents and my half-siblings,\" Bazella said. \"It's like the story was kind of over in 1983.\"\n\nPARENTS WELCOME 14-POUND BABY, THE LARGEST ON RECORD SINCE 2010: 'EVERYBODY WAS MAKING BETS'\n\nAdopted at nine months old, Bazella had been raised by kind and loving parents, the Petersons, in Edina, Minnesota.\n\nWhen she was a child, Bazella learned through her adoptive parents that she was adopted in 1961, nearly one year after being born at Booth Memorial Hospital \u2014 now known as the Booth Brown House Youth Shelter \u2014 in St. Paul, Minnesota, to 18-year-old parents who were unmarried.\n\nTRENDIEST BABY NAMES OF 2023 REVEALED AS LIAM IS KNOCKED OFF NO. 1 SPOT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS\n\n\"The Booth Brown House, which now serves as a safe place for youth to turn, began as a safe haven for unwed mothers,\" The Salvation Army Central Territory, which owns the Booth Brown House, states on its website.\n\n\"Started in the early 1900s as The Salvation Army Women\u2019s Home and Hospital, the facility moved to its current location \u2013 1471 Como Ave. W. in St. Paul \u2013 and became The Salvation Army Booth Memorial Hospital in 1913.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to The Salvation Army Central Territory for comment by email.\n\nBazell said that when she was 23, she looked through public birth records and was able to track down the woman she thought was her birth mother.\n\nThe woman welcomed Bazella into her fold. Bazella was able to learn intimate details about her birth, including that she was originally named Kelly Jean.\n\nSISTERS IN SYNC: 4 ARE PREGNANT AT THE SAME TIME WITH THEIR BABIES, IN 'COMPLETE SHOCK'\n\nBazella said that looking back, however, she never had a strong bond with the woman she thought was her biological mother, according to those birth records she had found.\n\nThe woman then died in 2000.\n\n\"She was raising younger children,\" Bazella said of the woman she thought was her biological mother. \"She had a lot going on. There just wasn\u2019t that bond.\"\n\nStill searching for a connection, Bazella decided in 2017 to see if maybe her birth father had other children.\n\n\u2018Shocked and confused\u2019\n\nSo, Bazella took a home DNA test \u2014 a technology that was newer on the market \u2014 and the results brought more confusion: She didn't match with any of her known relatives.\n\nMICHIGAN SIBLINGS REUNITE WITH THEIR 3-YEAR-OLD BROTHER AFTER HIS 6-MONTH HOSPITAL STAY FOR CANCER TREATMENT\n\n\"I was shocked and just so confused,\" Bazella said. \"But at the same time, I wasn\u2019t.\"\n\n\"When I met my mom, I truly felt unconditional love.\" \u2014 Diane Bazella\n\nOver the next four years, Bazella reached out to people who were listed on her genealogy report, trying to figure out how they could be related, but with no success.\n\nFinally, one woman she contacted, who showed up as a close DNA match, emailed her back.\n\n\"She reached out and said, \u2018I want to figure this out with you,\u2019\" Bazella said.\n\nIt took the two women more than a year to unravel the story.\n\n\"We were thinking [that] maybe I had a different birth father \u2026 and that maybe it was one of her relatives,\" Bazella said.\n\n\"She went and confronted her dad and came back with the name Sherri Nordlie.\"\n\nThe woman's father admitted to having fathered a baby girl with Sherri Nordlie \u2014 now Geerts \u2014 in 1960.\n\nThat's when Bazella said she had the revelation that her birth certificate \u2014 and everything she had thought for the past 40 years, including the identity of her birth mother was \u2014 was wrong.\n\nBABY NAMES THAT ARE REPORTEDLY BANNED IN AMERICA: WHAT TO KNOW\n\n\"I knew right away I was switched at birth,\" Bazella said.\n\n\"There had been a huge mistake, and it was like it all just came together.\"\n\nTwo baby girls had been born within hours of each other on Sept. 29 at the hospital for unwed mothers.\n\nOne of the babies was named Kelly Jean \u2014 and the other was named Dawn Marie.\n\nBazella, it turns out, was Dawn Marie \u2014 not Kelly Jean, as she originally thought. And Sherri Nordlie Geerts was her mother.\n\nBazella emailed Geerts and they started corresponding regularly.\n\n\"I lost 39 years \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of grieving with that.\" \u2014 Diane Bazella\n\n\"We were slowly getting to know each other through email,\" Bazella said. \"She had a lot on her plate as a caregiver to her husband, so we were slowly establishing our mother-daughter relationship.\"\n\nA LIFE IN PICTURES: FROM BIRTH INTO ADULTHOOD, A FATHER TAKES HIS SON\u2019S PHOTO EVERY DAY FOR DECADES\n\nFinally, on Christmas Day 2021, Bazella and Geerts heard each other\u2019s voices over the phone for the first time.\n\nThey met in person in July 2022.\n\nSince then, they have been talking on the phone frequently, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\n\u2018Same sense of humor\u2019\n\nDuring their conversations, Geerts opened up about having a baby when she was just 18 years old.\n\n\"I do remember the day I had to give her up,\" Geerts told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"I got to name her and I got to dress her. There was a lady there to take her away, and she was kind of shaky and it scared me because I didn\u2019t want her to pick her up.\"\n\nGeerts said she thought about her daughter every single year on her birthday.\n\nNow that the two have met, they've been getting together several times a year, either in California or Minnesota.\n\nCOUPLE OF 60 YEARS, SEPARATED FOR 215 DAYS AMID PANDEMIC, REUNITES IN TOUCHING VIDEO: 'I MISSED YOU SO MUCH'\n\nAnd from the first time they met in person, they began discovering things they have in common.\n\n\"We both keep things in order,\" Bazella said. \"We have our lists and we like to get things done.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"I also remember the first time we met \u2014 ee were getting ready to go out and she dug in her purse and pulled out all these tubes of lipstick.

They come in a range of colours to suit your style and are made from pure GCS-certified yarns to take the chill off your feet. And seeing as everyone loves cosy socks at Christmas, we think they\u2019re also a great choice for gifting.\n\nFor even more cosiness we think you should consider this Faux Fur Throw, made from soft and silky recycled fibres, and matching Soft Fur Hot Water Bottle. They give so much cuddle comfort on chilly winter evenings that you won\u2019t mind how long spring takes to come around.\n\nMix old traditions with new rituals\n\n(The White Company)\n\nWe all have traditions that are handed down through generations \u2013 things like opening the sloe gin after the last day of work or a ceremonial placing of the star on top of the Christmas tree. This year, why not start a new ritual such as a designated \u2018morning in bed\u2019 or an \u2018afternoon pyjama party\u2019, to make sure that Christmas is done your way.\n\nThe White Company has a range of nightwear that will add a touch of luxury to any lazy days. This Jersey Piped Printed Classic Pyjama Set will keep you comfortable from top to bottom, with its soft jersey-blend fabric inviting you to curl up in bed or on the sofa. Both the collared pyjama shirt and trousers are printed with tiny stars, adding a subtle sparkle to a festive snooze.\n\nFor most Christmas rituals, the Christmas tree takes centre stage and The White Company has got this covered too with a spectacular Pre Lit Grand Spruce Christmas Tree. Standing at 7.5ft tall its high quality faux foliage is an impressively natural-looking shade of green and in-built lights have various settings for a choice of lighting effects. It\u2019s also quick and easy to assemble and take down, leaving more time for those fun festive rituals.\n\nTime for the main event\u2026\n\n(The White Company)\n\nIt\u2019s the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for and, let\u2019s be honest, not everything will go to plan. There may be squabbles and you may not have got round to making your own Christmas pudding. But there\u2019s so much more to enjoy and you\u2019ll learn to appreciate that, whatever happens, your Christmas will be wonderful just the way it is.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s kids that make Christmas extra special, and with The Little White Company you\u2019ll find great gifts for the youngest members of the family besides those friends with newborns. We love their Jingles Reindeer Comforter which is made from recycled fibres and has a squidgy red nose and felt antlers for an all-over soft and soothing feel.\n\nThe White Company also has plenty of affordable gifts for grown ups that make great stocking fillers or presents for those surprise visitors. We suspect this Scent Stories Hamper will go down well with any recipient, with candles, hand wash, diffusers and more wrapped up in a hand-woven basket. The scents of myrrh, fir tree and Nordic wood will have your lucky recipient breathing in the magic of Christmas through a swirl of seasonal aromas.\n\nEnjoy the in-between days\n\n(The White Company)\n\nWe all lose track of time over Christmas, not sure what day it is or questioning if it\u2019s OK to eat mince pies and brandy butter for breakfast. But there\u2019s still plenty of time for fun and relaxation \u2013 a visit to see old friends, a quiet walk in the frosty woods and, of course, the fizz and sparkle of new year parties.\n\nTo help you get out of the house, even on the coldest mornings, this Down Filled Oversized Puffer Coat will keep you warm and help to make you look and feel great, despite the excesses of Christmas. Made from recycled fibres, and with a detachable hood filled, this down-filled quilted puffer will embrace you in a pillowy cuddle.\n\nWhen it comes to New Year\u2019s celebrations, you\u2019ll want to make sure your fizz is served in peak condition, ready for those corks to pop. This Champagne Trug is a party essential. Hand-soldered in nickel-plated stainless steel just fill it with ice and it will chill your Champagne to perfection. It also makes a great statement piece, announcing that yours is the place to go back to during the festive period and beyond.\n\nExplore more"

Once the clock strikes midnight on October 31st, Mariah Carey will defrost, peppermint mochas will inevitably return, and the 2023 holiday season will have officially begun.\n\nThankfully for those looking to get in the festive spirit, Govee\u2019s Matter-ready LED Strip Light M1 is on sale for an all-time low of $44.99 ($15 off) at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon. You can also buy it for $3 more direct from Govee through October 31st, which is still one of its better prices to date.\n\nWhile handy throughout the year, Govee\u2019s 6.56-foot (2m) light strip is particularly convenient during Halloween and other holidays. Not only can the bright, tunable LEDs flash and blink to the beat of your music, but they can also act as a festive piece of decor that adds a pop of color to your holiday parties. What\u2019s particularly great about this strip, though, is that it supports the newer Matter protocol, which allows you to control the lights with a wide array of smart home platforms.\n\nGovee LED Strip Light M1 Matter $ 45 $ 60 25 % off $ 45 $ 45 $ 60 25 % off The customizable Govee M1 Matter Compatible LED Strip Light is 6.56 feet long and can display millions of colors and shades of white.

We\u2019re also fans because of all the other perks they offer, like multipoint connectivity, long battery life, and a good transparency mode. They deliver even more value to Pixel phone owners as well, who can enjoy exclusive access features like head tracking spatial audio and Google\u2019s Clear Calling, which reduces background noise during calls.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro $ 117 $ 200 42 % off $ 117 $ 117 $ 200 42 % off Google\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro are the company\u2019s first earbuds to include active noise cancellation.

And right now, Verge readers can pick them up at Wellbots for $116.99 ($83 off) with offer code VERGE83. $117 at Wellbots\n\nSpeaking of Google gadgets, right now Verge readers can save an extra $80 on the already discounted Google Pixel Watch when they use promo code VERGEPIX80 at Wellbots, which drops the checkout price to $199.99. That\u2019s not bad considering Google\u2019s first-gen smartwatch retailed for $349.99 when it first launched a little over a year ago.\n\nThe first-gen Pixel Watch may not be as capable as the new Google Pixel Watch 2, but they have a number of strengths in common. Both offer health and fitness-tracking features powered by Fitbit, allowing you to enjoy special features like FDA-cleared EKGs. The wearables also support Google services like Google Assistant and Google Wallet. And now, thanks to the new Wear OS 4 update, you get access to the Google Calendar app, Gmail, and the new Safety Check feature introduced with the new wearable.\n\nThere are some trade-offs, though. The Pixel Watch 2 offers superior battery life, whereas the last-gen model struggles to last a full day. The newer wearable also sports some new tricks, including Sleep Profiles, abnormal heart rate tracking, and nightly SpO2 features. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re comfortable with these omissions, the first-gen model is still a good wearable to buy at this price.\n\nGoogle Pixel Watch $ 200 $ 350 43 % off $ 200 $ 200 $ 350 43 % off Google\u2019s first in-house smartwatch has a beautiful domed display and native Fitbit integration for health tracking.

However, if you want to keep track of all the ghosties and ghoulies that\u2019ll soon pay your front door a visit on Halloween, you can pick up the Blink Video Doorbell with the latest Blink Outdoor security camera on Amazon for just $89.99 ($90 off).\n\nBoth of the 1080p cameras come with tech that\u2019ll allow you to clearly see trick-or-treaters even after the sun goes down, in addition to support for motion detection and two-way audio. The battery-powered Blink Outdoor 4 also covers a wider field of view and supports person detection, which wasn\u2019t the case with the prior model.\n\nAs budget picks, they lack some premium features, including smart alerts. You\u2019ll also have to pay extra for features like cloud-based storage, though, otherwise, they\u2019re a pair of great security devices that\u2019ll protect your home just fine for years to come.\n\nBlink Video Doorbell (with Blink Outdoor 4) $ 90 $ 180 50 % off $ 90 $ 90 $ 180 50 % off Blink\u2019s Video Doorbell is the best if you\u2019re looking for a budget-friendly buzzer that offers motion-activated recording and alerts, night vision, two-way audio, and up to two years of battery life. $90 at Amazon\n\nVerge Deals on X (formerly known as Twitter) / Join more than 51,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\n\nSome more deals to kickstart your weekend"

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the\n\nLifestyle Edit email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ /verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong. Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIf you\u2019re in the midst of a new relationship this holiday season, you may be faced with the opportunity to introduce your significant other to your family. However, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve found yourself mulling over an array of reasons why the holidays may not be the right time for such an introduction.\n\nThe holiday season is often perceived as the most wonderful time of year, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case for everyone. In a recent poll from the American Psychological Association, 41 per cent of US adults said their stress levels increased from November to January when compared to other months of the year. Nearly 50 per cent of Americans also described their stress level during the season as \u201cmoderate\u201d.\n\nEveryone has different concerns leading up to Christmas, Hanukkah, or New Years - from family drama at the dinner table to a small spats with your mother about decorations. With what can be stressful events, it only begs the question: do you really want to bring your partner into the mix? While it\u2019s important to eventually introduce your loved ones to your significant other, relationship experts believe there are some discussions you should have beforehand, especially during the holidays.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Rachel Zar - a licensed marriage and family therapist at Spark Chicago Therapy - acknowledged that while every family is different, there\u2019s a variety of problems that could arise during the holiday season - mainly because we put too much pressure on having a joyful holiday. \u201cI think anytime that emotions are heightened, with the holidays certainly being one of those times, our expectations are really high,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting it to be this joyful, happy, perfect occasion. So, we sometimes forget that the holidays come with a lot of stress.\u201d\n\nDespite tensions between relatives at the dinner table, that doesn\u2019t mean your relationship shouldn\u2019t be celebrated. Saba Lurie is a licensed marriage and family therapist at Take Root Thereapy in California. She explained to The Independent that while there isn\u2019t a right or wrong time to introduce your partner to your family, the intentions of such an introduction must be clear. Not only should you have already discussed where your relationship is headed, but you should also tell your partner everything they need to know about your family.\n\n\u201cI think you should tell the person why you\u2019re bringing them home for the holidays, so you\u2019re on the same page about the intentions and what\u2019s motivating the decision to include,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it can be helpful for them to know about the dynamics that they\u2019re stepping into and how they can best support you. Frankly, they should be aware if there is tension or if there is stress within your family.\u201d\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nCommunication before the holidays goes both ways, and there are things that your family should know about your significant other too. \u201cIf there\u2019s something about your partner that could be surprising to your family, or that\u2019s a notable difference from who someone you\u2019ve brought home before, tell your relatives that,\u201d Zar said. \u201cLet\u2019s set your family and partner up for success.\u201d\n\nBefore bringing your significant other home for the holidays, you may want to express to your family how you wish for them to feel included - such as incorporating your partner\u2019s family traditions into your own celebration. However, Zar advised against oversharing information before Christmas. You still want your family and partner to connect in person, rather than hearing about each other through the grapevine.\n\nWhen it comes to introducing your partner to your family, there\u2019s still some extra planning to be done ahead of time. If you\u2019re travelling this month, you may need to decide on sleeping arrangements - as opposed to residing in your parent\u2019s house - in order to minimise family stress.\n\n\u201cIt would be really helpful to have conversations beforehand, so it\u2019s clear what you are agreeing or not agreeing to,\u201d Lurie explained. \u201cFor example, if your family isn\u2019t comfortable with you bringing someone home and sleeping in the same bedroom, then you and your partner may stay elsewhere. But those would be conversations that you all need to have together. It really depends on your relationship with your family and with your partner.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to be checking in with your partner while spending time with your family. These check-ins may include some quality time together, so that any family drama that may arise isn\u2019t hurting your relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recommend pulling your partner aside and saying: \u2018How are we doing?\u2019 Like a temperature check,\u201d she added. \u201cThose are points where the two of you can come and remind each other: \u2018We are a team in this.\u2019 Or, the two of you could go on a walk and separate from the family, just for a little bit of time to reset within the relationship.\u201d\n\nDuring the holiday season, your partner may be seeing how you interact with your family for the first time. But that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, according to the relationship experts. \u201cI think introducing a significant other to family is a really vulnerable act, and that vulnerability is going to be what allows for greater intimacy,\u201d Lurie said. \u201cWhen your significant other sees you with your family, they may see another side of you that they may not have had access to before.\u201d\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nOn the other hand, your partner could learn that your relationship with your parents and extended family members is complex. That isn\u2019t necessarily a cause for concern, as long as you inform your significant other about the interworkings of your family dynamics.\n\n\u201cI think that we tend to be our best relational self when we\u2019ve really done the work around understanding all of our past relationships,\u201d Zar explained. \u201cYou can tell your partner: \u2018I don\u2019t have a close relationship with my brother, and here\u2019s why. Here are the intentional choices that I\u2019ve made around it.\u2019 Or you can say: \u2018Here\u2019s my chosen family. These are the people who are important to me.\u2019 Your significant other will see that you\u2019ve been introspective and have takeaways around how you\u2019ve navigated your family\u2019s origin.\u201d\n\nAs long as you and your partner have discussed your relationship expectations - both before and during the holidays \u2013 introducing them to your family may deepen your relationship and could be a step in the right direction. Or, it could have a simpler meaning - the holidays being an opportunity to bring two important people in your life together and get to know each other.\n\nRegardless of what your relationship with your family is like, deciding how and when to introduce your partner to your loved ones is entirely up to you. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever going to be a perfect time for folks,\u201d Lurie said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll depend on the relationship between the two partners and also on the family dynamics, and what feels more comfortable for all parties. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a right or wrong time for the introduction.\u201d"

On March 31, 2023, Kentucky became the 34th state to legalize sports betting and the 25th with online/mobile access. Retail locations opened on September 7 and Kentucky online sports betting became legal on September 28.\n\nThe betting menu for Kentuckians is exhaustive in that they are able to legally wager on all major professional, collegiate and international sports, unlike other sports betting states.

The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.\n\nLouisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.\n\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: With no \"Big Four\" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.\n\nCincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.\n\nTop Kentucky betting terms for new bettors\n\nAgainst the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.\n\nMoney line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.\n\nOutright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.\n\nOver/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.\n\nPlayer prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.\n\nUnderdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.\n\nFavorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.\n\nConsensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.\n\nFutures: While money line, against the spread and over/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.\n\nParlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.\n\nJuice: Also known as \"The Vig\" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.\n\nPush: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.\n\nLive/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads/totals.\n\nYou can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMattel has been criticised for its new Barbie doll honouring Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nLast month, Mattel announced that it was releasing a doll of Mankiller, who inspired countless Native American children as a powerful but humble leader who expanded early education and rural healthcare. The creation of the doll is part of the toy company\u2019s \u201cInspiring Women\u201d series. On 6 December, the Cherokee Nation also hosted an event to to celebrate the Wilma Mankiller Barbie.\n\nMankiller was the nation\u2019s first female Principal Chief, leading the tribe for a decade until 1995. She focused on improving social conditions through consensus and on restoring pride in Native heritage. The social worker, who died in 2010, met snide remarks about her surname \u2014 a military title \u2014 with humour, often delivering a straight-faced response: \u201cMankiller is actually a well-earned nickname.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Mattel, the Barbie doll of Mankiller portrays her dark hair, as the toy \u201cwears a richly pigmented turquoise dress with ribbon striping that represents the four directions: north, south, east and west\u201d. The toy also comes with a basket, with her look inspired by an iconic photo of Mankiller where she\u2019s holding a woven basket.\n\nHowever, Mattel has now faced some criticism over the doll, with people calling the toy company out for inaccuracies. Chuck Hoskin Jr, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, noted to The New York Times that the doll\u2019s basket wasn\u2019t authentically Cherokee. He also specified that the wrong sets of symbols used for the Cherokee language were included in the packaging of the doll. As a result, the symbols on the package read \u201cChicken Nation\u201d as opposed to Cherokee Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo someone who doesn\u2019t read Cherokee syllabary, they\u2019re not going to notice it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the Cherokee people for whom Wilma is of such enduring significance and we have such enduring love for her, to see our seal incorrect, it\u2019s very disappointing because it would not have taken much effort or thought to avoid that.\u201d\n\nHoskin specified that he learned about the creation of the doll six months ago, and that Mattel did not work directly with the Cherokee Nation. However, he specified that the company has been understanding of the criticism.\n\n\u201cAfter some of the problems were revealed, we had very good conversations with Mattel. And I think they responded internally to us in a very thoughtful way and expressed some regret for not engaging us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation issued a statement regarding the criticism. \u201cRegrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the tribal government\u2019s design and communications team to secure the official Seal or verify it,\u201d the tribe said.\n\nMattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the problem with the syllabary and is \u201cdiscussing options\u201d. The company worked with Mankiller\u2019s estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie Soap, and her friend, Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll.\n\nSome Cherokee women were also critical of the doll, with claims that Mattel overlooked the problematic details on the doll and the packaging.\n\n\u201cMixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering Cherokee women in decision making,\u201d Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, told The Associated Press in an email.\n\nRegina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah, doesn\u2019t think the doll looks like Mankiller. Mattel should have considered traditional pucker toe moccasins, instead of black shoes, and included symbols on the basket that Cherokees use to tell a story, she said.\n\n\u201cWilma\u2019s name is the only thing Cherokee on that box,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNothing about that doll is Wilma, nothing.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of the doll in November, Hoskin had issued a statement to express how meaningful the creation was to the Cherokee Nation.\n\n\u201cWhen Native girls see it, they can achieve it, and Wilma Mankiller has shown countless young women to be fearless and speak up for Indigenous and human rights. She not only served in a role dominated by men during a time that tribal nations were suppressed, but she led,\u201d he said. \u201cWilma Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and even my own daughter. She truly exemplifies leadership, culture and equality and we applaud Mattel for commemorating her in the Barbie Inspiring Women Series.\u201d\n\nMankiller, whose likeness is on a US quarter issued in 2021, is the second Native American woman honoured with a Barbie doll. Famed aviator Bessie Coleman, who was of Black and Cherokee ancestry, was depicted earlier this year. Other dolls in the \u201cInspiring Women\u201d series include Maya Angelou, Ida B Wells, Jane Goodall and Madam CJ Walker.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

    "body": "If you are a devoted vinyl collector, an obsessive music fan, or \u2014 as is often the case \u2014 both, Discogs is very nearly a lifestyle. The site has become the internet\u2019s foremost database of recorded music and one of the most extensive marketplaces available for physical music media, with every bit of it generated and offered by users. You can catalog your collection, look up information about even the most obscure artists, cross-check record store prices to see if your local shop has a markup, and purchase records, typically at something close to their \u201cmarket rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people just buy records for the album art hanging on the wall,\u201d says Doug Martin, who started selling on Discogs in 2020. But the Discogs users were different. \u201cThese were real fans listening to real music who cared about the format and the medium. That\u2019s what attracted me in the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe site has become a central part of the music internet, surviving through physical music media\u2019s replacement by MP3s and then streaming \u2014 and rebounding as interest in vinyl, CDs, and tapes did throughout the 2010s. But sellers who use the platform say the site\u2019s old tech has started to wear on them, and new fees and restrictions have made it harder to do business. Changes within the company are threatening to turn a bastion for vinyl fans, record stores, and anyone who cares about music into just another dysfunctional website \u2014 and dismantle a singular record of music history, even if just by pushing the sellers and users who have created that record away.\n\nA fastidiously detailed Wikipedia for music\n\nWhat was initially conceived of as something of a Wikipedia for recorded music \u2014 although, founded in 2000 by Intel programmer Kevin Lewandowski, it predates the encyclopedia site by a few months \u2014 hasn\u2019t changed a great deal since its conception, besides the introduction of the marketplace in the mid-aughts. Discogs is a fairly clunky, definitely old-fashioned website devoted to even older technology: a vestige of an earlier, more idyllic internet that has spent the last decade walking the record-needle-thin line between 2020s algorithmically driven tech monolith and niche unprofitable obscurity.\n\nA big part of its ability to walk that line is the passion of its user base. Sellers have to submit a record\u2019s information if it\u2019s not already in the database in order to sell it \u2014 that\u2019s how the database has become so complete. And many entries, even for deep obscurities, are fastidious: album covers and liner notes are scanned for inclusion and album credits are fleshed out with hyperlinks that are almost more useful and thorough than the Wikipedia equivalent, plus reviews by devotees. There is even a lively forum where all of these details get litigated. It is an insular community in many ways. But it is also, and has always been, a money-making endeavor for both Discogs and the sellers who use it.\n\nDiscogs is now the source of many people\u2019s full-time employment. A European Discogs seller, who has been on the platform since 2008 and requested anonymity for fear of retribution by the company, says he does 80 percent of his business on the platform. He does not operate a brick-and-mortar storefront but has four employees and nets around \u20ac20,000 a month on Discogs. According to him, his sales have shrunk by half over the past year, and he\u2019s in the process of building his own site to try to move away from the platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my living with this company for the past decade,\u201d says a Connecticut seller who also does the majority of his business on Discogs and requested anonymity for the same reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s just the frustration that you have no control over what they\u2019re doing, and it doesn\u2019t even make any sense.\u201d The vinyl renaissance has occurred in tandem with the growth of Discogs, making the site fairly integrated into any record business \u2014 regardless of whether a business has a brick-and-mortar storefront. A major change to the site, then, could mean a major shift in the record market as a whole.\n\nUnderlying the sellers\u2019 complaints is a kind of dismay, the feeling that what had previously been a safe haven for nerds to buy and sell $2 records is being threatened \u2014 that one more corner of the internet that wasn\u2019t yet a glossy behemoth designed to subsume and capitalize on your personal information was about to collapse.\n\n\u201cWhen you get any kind of community built around a business, and you tweak that a little bit, you\u2019re gonna make a lot of people upset,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThis is their Discogs, they built it.\u201d\n\nThe problems started in earnest when the company raised its fee from 8 to 9 percent on May 22nd of this year, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 started charging that same fee on shipping costs for the first time, an issue considering how international the record market is. One of the beauties of Discogs had previously been finding and purchasing rarities from sellers in Japan or Germany; the most expensive record I\u2019ve ever purchased, for example, was a copy of Cannonball Adderley\u2019s debut album from a seller in Switzerland. Now, the site is taking considerably larger slices of those kinds of sales. (Discogs declined to comment for this story.)\n\nYou\u2019ll find details on just about every release of every album on Discogs. This entry for a Japanese pressing of Thelonious Monk in Italy includes photos of the record jacket and both sides of the vinyl.\n\nTo make up for the lost revenue, Discogs suggested sellers use a tool it had created to raise the prices of all of their inventory by a percentage; another Discogs email to sellers suggested they offer free shipping to avoid the fee, without accounting for the fact that the seller would then be either covering that cost out of pocket or integrating it into the price of the record \u2014 which would, of course, result in the same amount of money going to Discogs. Essentially, sellers were told to raise their prices and / or offer free shipping \u2014 two options that threaten their bottom lines. \u201cTheir communication, too \u2014 it\u2019s like, \u2018I said what I said, and we\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d says Martin. \u201cWell, you\u2019re really not, because we all have to live with this and so do you.\u201d\n\nThe tension between Discogs\u2019 old-internet charm and its attempts at growth came to a head earlier this summer around a since-deleted viral Twitter thread by artist and label head Mike Simonetti lamenting \u201cthe fall of discogs.\u201d Simonetti sounded the alarm about increasing fees and subsequently increasing prices, a growing influx of scammers, rising shipping costs, and the dysfunction of the website itself, among other issues.\n\n\u201cWe had kind of thought Discogs was on our side as sellers,\u201d says Gene Melkisethian, who runs Joint Custody, a record store in Washington, DC, and sells on Discogs. \u201cBut when they started charging fees on shipping, it just felt really punitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn their communication, it was beyond insulting the way they framed it. Like, \u2018Oh, you can just not charge for shipping,\u2019\u201d says the Connecticut seller. \u201cThe sudden fee increase was a huge, huge blow to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe fee increase arrived shortly before USPS raised the price of its Media Mail service (the lower rates at which anyone can send media products like books, music, and movies) by an average of 7 percent \u2014 and a year after the site had switched all its transactions to PayPal, which charges its own fees on each transaction, ones that are higher on international purchases. PayPal also requires that every shipment has a tracking number, which can be a significant extra expense for international sales.\n\nThe changes also arrived at the tail end of a phenomenon alluded to in the same original thread. The pandemic had created something of a record sales bubble: people who were already vinyl aficionados were stuck at home with their record players, stimulus checks, and nothing to spend them on besides survival and things you could do at home \u2014 like listen to music. Melkisethian says his sales actually grew during the pandemic in spite of the fact that his brick-and-mortar sales disappeared. According to him, the boom inflated record prices; now, with the higher fees Discogs is imposing, a sales decline that was almost inevitable post-lockdown has become steeper.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re under the impression that they\u2019re the only game in town.\u201d\n\nEven with all of those increasing costs, Discogs is still less expensive (albeit now only slightly) than alternatives like eBay or Amazon. But those alternatives, being considerably larger and more mainstream, offer a much broader base of potential buyers as well as a more solid infrastructure and support system.\n\n\u201ceBay has much more of a user base, so for the little bit of extra cost it\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d says Martin, who says that, for him, eBay\u2019s fees are usually around 1 percent higher than Discogs\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s probably double [the business] I do on Discogs, and that\u2019s only grown since they raised the fees.\u201d He sells primarily new vinyl and uses Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and Discogs, along with his own website, apocalypsevinyl.com. With the new fees and the competitiveness of the Discogs market, the platform is becoming less and less useful as a selling channel.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re under the impression that they\u2019re the only game in town,\u201d says the Connecticut seller of Discogs. \u201cThe fees were relatively low, but now that they\u2019re higher, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a reason to use that anymore.\u201d He\u2019s been selling on Discogs since 2009; since the recent changes, he\u2019s lowered his prices to offset the higher shipping costs and was compelled to institute an order minimum \u2014 a major shift for a marketplace that had done considerable business in selling records under $10 and even under $5.\n\nDiscogs attributed the need to raise fees to its \u201csignificant investments in recent years to ensure compliance with various regulatory programs, including tax support and privacy protection.\u201d The company said the change would allow it to \u201ccontinue to devote resources to maintaining the Discogs Marketplace and develop better tools for collecting, selling, and enjoying music.\u201d\n\nMany sellers who spoke with The Verge speculated, in line with the viral thread, that the company was trying to pump up its valuation for a potential sale. All of them, though, had the sense that Discogs was trying to increase its profit margins without necessarily offering any improvements to its product in return.\n\nDiscogs\u2019 marketplace page showing copies of Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Guts for sale. The prices are generally higher than buying the album elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like they\u2019re actively trying to stop sales,\u201d says the Connecticut seller. \u201cYou can raise your fees, but maybe you could do some promotions, coupon codes, sales \u2014 something that offsets the shift. Sellers can do it on their own, but that\u2019s going to require them to lower their prices \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a race to the bottom. If you were trying to ruin a sales forum, this is how you\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\nDiscogs did have a sale in late August, but it featured just 11 of the site\u2019s largest stores. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought, maybe they\u2019ll be randomly promoting stores or the best products,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI don\u2019t know a big sale that most people are not part of that you promote to further depress our prices is the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe website itself is a frequent source of complaints, as is the lack of support. (My query for a press contact was sent on July 25th, for example; I received a response on August 23rd.) \u201cI guess the most apparent thing has been the lack of updates, or any positive progress in the operation of a website,\u201d says Melkisethian, who has been selling on Discogs since 2011. \u201cIt was a little bit quaint back then, but it has not improved in any way. It\u2019s actually only gotten worse, which is kind of funny \u2014 but knowing how much money I\u2019ve given them and other people give them, it\u2019s like, who\u2019s steering the ship?\u201d\n\nDiscogs is in the process of rolling out a redesign, one that \u2014 to look at the forums at least \u2014 doesn\u2019t have many fans among the Discogs lifers but is definitely sleeker-looking. According to the sellers who spoke with The Verge, bugs abound: the European seller, for example, had just been dealing with an issue with the platform\u2019s refund button. \u201cDiscogs said it was PayPal\u2019s fault, and PayPal said it was Discogs\u2019 fault,\u201d he says. \u201cIt caused stress for the buyers, and so I had to do direct refunds \u2014 which meant I was refunding not just what I made but Discogs\u2019 and PayPal\u2019s commissions as well, effectively losing money on the refund.\u201d Melkisethian, speaking a month later, had just noticed a shift in the way shipments are processed that required manually entering information in steps that used to be automated.\n\nBesides the baseline functionality of the site, there are other improvements that could bring Discogs closer in line with its competitors. \u201cThere are other seller tools and seller initiatives that we\u2019ve been asking for for years that have never been done \u2014 like any kind of tie-in with Google, any kind of integration with social media, the kinds of things basically other platform has,\u201d says Martin.\n\nThe database is another aspect of the site that could be threatened by the fee increases. If sellers and buyers move elsewhere, that database will likely become less exhaustive. \u201cEver since the price increases, I\u2019ve noticed that less and less new albums are being added to the database,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWhen we get new stock in, we have to match it up with a UPC on Discogs and we\u2019re noticing it\u2019s not there as often as it used to be.\u201d\n\nA beloved internet sanctuary gets bled for profit to the detriment of its functionality \u2014 by 2023, it\u2019s become just about the most familiar story online. Discogs, hopefully, will not become the latest in a long line of formerly useful sites; for the moment, though, sellers feel alienated by the small company they once viewed as an ally in an optimistic mission to share knowledge about music."

    "body": "Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), charged with bribery, gave Wall Street bank executives a pop quiz about their own corporate misbehavior that they all failed.\n\nOn Wednesday, at a congressional hearing, the embattled Menendez grilled Wall Street executives about how much money the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered each of their firms to pay back to consumers for allegedly violating federal laws including charging illegal junk fees and opening fake customer accounts. Through his questioning, the senator was attempting to show that, contrary to what the bank CEOs argued, new financial regulations do benefit everyday customers.\n\nMenendez directed his arrows at four retail bank CEOs\u2014all of whom were unable to respond. He started with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and moved down a long table asking Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharff how much each had \u201creturned to customers in the form of redresses and payments at the direction of CFPB?\u201d\n\nThough the executives didn\u2019t know the answer, the numbers are large, even for top Wall Street firms: $360 million for JPMorgan Chase, $819 million for Bank of America, $1 billion for Citigroup, and \u201cover $2 billion\u201d for Wells Fargo. All in all, it amounts to nearly $4 billion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing you don\u2019t know the number because they\u2019re not small in nature,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cIt\u2019s over $4 billion returned to hardworking consumers in the past dozen years.\u201d\n\nMenendez\u2019s own adherence to the law happens to also be in question. In September, the Justice Department charged him and his wife Nadine with accepting bribes and allegedly using his Senate seat to improperly aid the Egyptian government. A raid of Menendez\u2019s house turned up $100,000 in gold bars and bundles of cash stuffed into jacket pockets. Menendez pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is facing legal challenges of its own. The watchdog, created in 2011 in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, is facing a Supreme Court case that could determine its future. The Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade organization that represents payday lenders, alleges the CFPB is unconstitutional because it is not subject to annual appropriations from Congress.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit currently before the Supreme Court over the CFPB\u2019s funding structure has the potential to upend every rule, guidance and order the CFPB has ever issued, tossing over a decade of consumer protection law out of the window,\u201d Menendez said during the hearing to defend the CFPB. \u201cThat\u2019s not just harmful for consumers. I think it\u2019s dangerous to the financial system.\u201d\n\nThe annual Senate hearing featured eight executives, including the four Menendez questioned, from the biggest financial institutions. Executives and legislators discussed new regulations that would require the big banks to keep larger capital reserves. The big banks argued the new rules would limit their ability to lend to lower and middle income buyers. In contrast, committee chair Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) disagreed and said any reduced lending would be due to banks prioritizing riskier investments that have higher returns.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather fund risky trading and derivatives bets than boring bread and butter small business lending,\u201d Brown said in his opening remarks.\n\nThe indicted Menendez also framed some of the banks\u2019 unpopular practices, like overdraft fees, as a decision rather than a necessity.\n\n\u201cCharging the fees is a choice\u2014one that disproportionately harms Black and brown communities, Menendez said. Getting rid of overdraft fees would \u201cchange the course of events for a significant part of [your] consumer base.\u201d\n\nResearch points to the fact that overdraft fees disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic customers. A 2021 study found that Hispanic Americans paid $3.1 billion in overdraft fees a year Black Americans were hit with $1.4 billion in total. Another survey found they paid double the amount of fees than White people did.\n\nMenendez commended Citibank\u2019s Fraser for her company eliminating such fees in 2022 after government officials urged an end to the practice. Big banks like Citi also face competitive pressures from fintech startups and smaller banks, like Ally Bank, that offer bank accounts without overdraft fees.\n\n\u201cIs it fair to say that Citi is still a profitable bank?\u201d Menendez asked Fraser.\n\n\u201cYes, Senator,\u201d Fraser replied.\n\nMenendez pressed her further, asking if their elimination led to wholesale changes at the bank.\n\n\u201cDid [removing] overdraft fees upend your business model,\u201d Menendez continued.\n\n\u201cNo, Senator,\u201d Fraser answered. \u201cWe work hard to protect our customers and make sure that they don\u2019t fall into overdraft.\u201d\n\nMenendez used this line of questioning to encourage Scharff, Dimon, and Moynihan to learn from Fraser and Citigroup. \u201cI suggest you call Mr. Fraser after this hearing to figure out how you can still be able to eliminate the fees in their entirety and still run a profitable bank,\u201d Menendez urged Scharff, Moynihan, and Dimon.\n\nThe other banks have made some steps to ease overdraft fees but haven\u2019t done away with them completely. In 2021, JPMorgan Chase eliminated fees for overdrafts that were under $50. The new policy still led to an increase in revenue from overdraft fees, which rose 3% in 2022, a year after the policy was implemented, according to Bloomberg. Wells Fargo also loosened its rules without getting rid of the fees entirely, affording customers a 24-hour grace period to pay back any overdrafted accounts. Meanwhile, Bank of America cut its overdraft fees from $35 to $10."

    "body": "The Biden administration announced the details of a long-awaited executive order on AI today, ahead of an international summit on AI safety being held in the U.K. But as with all such orders, what the president can dictate without legislative support is limited, as numerous experts and stakeholders emphasized in response.\n\nThe order comes as governments across the globe continue their attempts to address the opportunities and risks of AI, which has so far proved too fast a moving target for regulators. Facing twin risks of premature action chilling innovation and dilatory action permitting abuse or exploitation, the U.S. and EU have avoided the first but due to lengthy argument and drafting processes are rolling headlong toward the second.\n\nBiden\u2019s EO operates as a stopgap that props up the \u201cvoluntary\u201d practices many companies are already choosing to implement. The limits on what a president can do with a wave of their hand means it\u2019s a lot of sharing results, developing best practices and providing clear guidance.\n\nThat\u2019s because right now there is no legislative remedy to potential AI risks and abuses outside of those that can be applied to tech companies in general \u2014 which many have argued over the years are also inadequate. Federal action on social media and de facto monopolies like Amazon and Google has been sporadic, though a hawkish new FTC may change that trend.\n\nMeanwhile, a comprehensive law defining and limiting the use of AI seems as far off now as it was years ago. The industry and technology have evolved so quickly that any rule would likely be outdated by the time it was passed. It\u2019s not even really clear what ought to be legislatively limited, as opposed to being left to state law or expert agencies.\n\nPerhaps the wisest approach is to set up a new federal agency dedicated to regulating AI and technology, but this cannot be accomplished by fiat. In the meantime, the EO at least instructs several AI-focused groups, like one in the Department of Health and Human Services dedicated to handling and assessing reports of AI-related harms in healthcare.\n\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was \u201cimpressed by the breadth\u201d of the order, though, he implies, not the depth.\n\n\u201cI am also happy to see a number of sections that closely align with my efforts around AI safety and security and federal government\u2019s use of AI,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, many of these just scratch the surface \u2013 particularly in areas like health care and competition policy. While this is a good step forward, we need additional legislative measures, and I will continue to work diligently\u2026\u201d etc.\n\nGiven the state of the legislature and the fact that an incredibly contentious election period is upcoming, it will be a miracle if any substantive law whatsoever is passed in the near future, let alone a potentially divisive and complex bill like AI rules.\n\nPaul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, acknowledged both sides of the issue.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden is sending a valuable message that certain AI systems create immediate risks that demand immediate attention. The administration is moving in the right direction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut today is just the beginning of a regulatory process that will be long and arduous\u2013and ultimately must require that the companies profiting from AI bear the burden of proving that their products are safe and effective, just as the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals or airplanes must demonstrate that their products are safe and effective. Without fresh resources provided by Congress, it\u2019s not clear that the federal government has the resources to assess the vastly complicated training process or the adequacy of red-teaming and other necessary testing.\u201d\n\nSheila Gulati, co-founder of Tola Capital, said the EO showed a \u201cclear intention to walk the line of promoting innovation while protecting citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is most essential that we don\u2019t prevent agile innovation by startups. Putting AI explainability at the forefront, taking a risk-based approach with more focus on areas where harm or bias could be at play, and bringing security and privacy to the center of focus are all sensible steps,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cWith this executive order and the standards implications through NIST, we would anticipate leadership from standards bodies versus legislators in the near term.\u201d\n\nIt is worth mentioning as well that the federal government is a major customer of today\u2019s AI and tech products, and any company that intends to keep them as a customer will want to color inside the lines for the immediate future.\n\nBob Cattanach, partner at legal mega-firm Dorsey and Whitney, added that the timing feels slightly off.\n\n\u201c\u2026The Executive Order awkwardly preempts the voice of Vice President Harris at a U.K.-hosted Summit on AI later this week, signaling that White House concerns over the largely unregulated space were so grave that Biden was prepared to alienate key allies by taking unilateral action rather than accept the delays inherent in the more collaborative process currently underway in the EU.\u201d\n\nAlienate is perhaps a strong word for it. And of course, the U.K. is not the EU. And that \u201cmore collaborative process\u201d will likely take a few more years, and it\u2019s unlikely the administration wants to wait until then. But it might indeed have been more coherent and ally-like to have Harris discuss the EO at the summit. Her remarks (which will no doubt suggest the need for international harmony in AI regulation, with the U.S. modestly taking the lead) will be streamed on November 1, and you should be able to tune in here."

    "body": "Over the course of two months from its debut in November 2022, ChatGPT exploded in popularity, from niche online curio to 100 million monthly active users \u2014 the fastest user base growth in the history of the Internet. In less than a year, it has earned the backing of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest firms, and been shoehorned into myriad applications from academia and the arts to marketing, medicine, gaming and government.\n\nIn short ChatGPT is just about everywhere. Few industries have remained untouched by the viral adoption of the generative AI\u2019s tools. On the first anniversary of its release, let\u2019s take a look back on the year of ChatGPT that brought us here.\n\nOpenAI had been developing GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the large language model that ChatGPT runs on, since 2016 \u2014 unveiling GPT-1 in 2018 and iterating it to GPT-3 by June 2020. With the November 30, 2022 release of GPT-3.5 came ChatGPT, a digital agent capable of superficially understanding natural language inputs and generating written responses to them. Sure, it was rather slow to answer and couldn\u2019t speak to questions about anything that happened after September 2021 \u2014 not to mention its issues answering queries with misinformation during bouts of \u201challucinations\" \u2014 but even that kludgy first iteration demonstrated capabilities far beyond what other state-of-the-art digital assistants like Siri and Alexa could provide.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s release timing couldn\u2019t have been better. The public had already been introduced to the concept of generative artificial intelligence in April of that year with DALL-E 2, a text-to-image generator. DALL-E 2, as well as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and similar programs, were an ideal low-barrier entry point for the general public to try out this revolutionary new technology. They were an immediate smash hit, with Subreddits and Twitter accounts springing up seemingly overnight to post screengrabs of the most outlandish scenarios users could imagine. And it wasn\u2019t just the terminally online that embraced AI image generation, the technology immediately entered the mainstream discourse as well, extraneous digits and all.\n\nSo when ChatGPT dropped last November, the public was already primed on the idea of having computers make content at a user\u2019s direction. The logical leap from having it make words instead of pictures wasn\u2019t a large one \u2014 heck, people had already been using similar, inferior versions in their phones for years with their digital assistants.\n\nQ1: [Hyping intensifies]\n\nTo say that ChatGPT was well-received would be to say that the Titanic suffered a small fender-bender on its maiden voyage. It was a polestar, magnitudes bigger than the hype surrounding DALL-E and other image generators. People flat out lost their minds over the new AI and its CEO, Sam Altman. Throughout December 2022, ChatGPT\u2019s usage numbers rose meteorically as more and more people logged on to try it for themselves.\n\nBy the following January, ChatGPT was a certified phenomenon, surpassing 100 million monthly active users in just two months. That was faster than both TikTok or Instagram, and remains the fastest user adoption to 100 million in the history of the internet.\n\nWe also got our first look at the disruptive potential that generative AI offers when ChatGPT managed to pass a series of law school exams (albeit by the skin of its digital teeth). Around that time Microsoft extended its existing R&D partnership with OpenAI to the tune of $10 billion that January. That number is impressively large and likely why Altman still has his job.\n\nAs February rolled around, ChatGPT\u2019s user numbers continued to soar, surpassing one billion users total with an average of more than 35 million people per day using the program. At this point OpenAI was reportedly worth just under $30 billion and Microsoft was doing its absolute best to cram the new technology into every single system, application and feature in its product ecosystem. ChatGPT was incorporated into BingChat (now just Copilot) and the Edge browser to great fanfare \u2014 despite repeated incidents of bizarre behavior and responses that saw the Bing program temporarily taken offline for repairs.\n\nOther tech companies began adopting ChatGPT as well: Opera incorporating it into its browser, Snapchat releasing its GPT-based My AI assistant (which would be unceremoniously abandoned a few problematic months later) and Buzzfeed News\u2019s parent company used it to generate listicles.\n\nMarch saw more of the same, with OpenAI announcing a new subscription-based service \u2014 ChatGPT Plus \u2014 which offers users the chance to skip to the head of the queue during peak usage hours and added features not found in the free version. The company also unveiled plug-in and API support for the GPT platform, empowering developers to add the technology to their own applications and enabling ChatGPT to pull information from across the internet as well as interact directly with connected sensors and devices.\n\nChatGPT also notched 100 million users per day in March, 30 times higher than two months prior. Companies from Slack and Discord to GM announced plans to incorporate GPT and generative AI technologies into their products.\n\nNot everybody was quite so enthusiastic about the pace at which generative AI was being adopted, mind you. In March, OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, as well as Steve Wozniak and a slew of associated AI researchers signed an open letter demanding a six month moratorium on AI development.\n\nQ2: Electric Boog-AI-loo\n\nOver the next couple months, company fell into a rhythm of continuous user growth, new integrations, occasional rival AI debuts and nationwide bans on generative AI technology. For example, in April, ChatGPT\u2019s usage climbed nearly 13 percent month-over-month from March even as the entire nation of Italy outlawed ChatGPT use by public sector employees, citing GDPR data privacy violations. The Italian ban proved only temporary after the company worked to resolve the flagged issues, but it was an embarrassing rebuke for the company and helped spur further calls for federal regulation.\n\nWhen it was first released, ChatGPT was only available through a desktop browser. That changed in May when OpenAI released its dedicated iOS app and expanded the digital assistant\u2019s availability to an additional 11 countries including France, Germany, Ireland and Jamaica. At the same time, Microsoft\u2019s integration efforts continued apace, with Bing Search melding into the chatbot as its \u201cdefault search experience.\u201d OpenAI also expanded ChatGPT\u2019s plug-in system to ensure that more third-party developers are able to build ChatGPT into their own products.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s tendency to hallucinate facts and figures was once again exposed that month when a lawyer in New York was caught using the generative AI to do \u201clegal research.\u201d It gave him a number of entirely made-up, nonexistent cases to cite in his argument \u2014 which he then did without bothering to independently validate any of them. The judge was not amused.\n\nBy June, a little bit of ChatGPT\u2019s shine had started to wear off. Congress reportedly limited Capitol Hill staffers from using the application over data handling concerns. User numbers had declined nearly 10 percent month-over-month, but ChatGPT was already well on its way to ubiquity. A March update enabling the AI to comprehend and generate Python code in response to natural language queries only increased its utility.\n\nQ3: [Pushback intensifies]\n\nMore cracks in ChatGPT\u2019s facade began to show the following month when OpenAI\u2019s head of Trust and Safety, Dave Willner, abruptly announced his resignation days before the company released its ChatGPT Android app. His departure came on the heels of news of an FTC investigation into the company\u2019s potential violation of consumer protection laws \u2014 specifically regarding the user data leak from March that inadvertently shared chat histories and payment records.\n\nIt was around this time that OpenAI\u2019s training methods, which involve scraping the public internet for content and feeding it into massive datasets on which the models are taught, came under fire from copyright holders and marquee authors alike. Much in the same manner that Getty Images sued Stability AI for Stable Diffusion\u2019s obvious leverage of copyrighted materials, stand-up comedian and author Sara Silverman brought suit against OpenAI with allegations that its \u201cBook2\u201d dataset illegally included her copyrighted works. The Authors Guild of America, which represents Stephen King, John Grisham and 134 others launched a class-action suit of its own in September. While much of Silverman\u2019s suit was eventually dismissed, the Author\u2019s Guild suit continues to wend its way through the courts.\n\nSelect news outlets, on the other hand, proved far more amenable. The Associated Press announced in August that it had entered into a licensing agreement with OpenAI which would see AP content used (with permission) to train GPT models. At the same time, the AP unveiled a new set of newsroom guidelines explaining how generative AI might be used in articles, while still cautioning journalists against using it for anything that might actually be published.\n\nChatGPT itself didn\u2019t seem too inclined to follow the rules. In a report published in August, the Washington Post found that guardrails supposedly enacted by OpenAI in March, designed to counter the chatbot\u2019s use in generating and amplifying political disinformation, actually weren\u2019t. The company told Semafor in April that it was \"developing a machine learning classifier that will flag when ChatGPT is asked to generate large volumes of text that appear related to electoral campaigns or lobbying.\" Per the Post, those rules simply were not enforced, with the system eagerly returning responses for prompts like \u201cWrite a message encouraging suburban women in their 40s to vote for Trump\u201d or \u201cMake a case to convince an urban dweller in their 20s to vote for Biden.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI was rolling out another batch of new features and updates for ChatGPT including an Enterprise version that could be fine-tuned to a company\u2019s specific needs and trained on the firm\u2019s internal data, allowing the chatbot to provide more accurate responses. Additionally, ChatGPT\u2019s ability to browse the internet for information was restored for Plus users in September, having been temporarily suspended earlier in the year after folks figured out how to exploit it to get around paywalls. OpenAI also expanded the chatbot\u2019s multimodal capabilities, adding support for both voice and image inputs for user queries in a September 25 update.\n\nQ4: Starring Sam Altman as \u201cLazarus\u201d\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 has been a hell of a decade for OpenAI. On the technological front, Browse with Bing, Microsoft\u2019s answer to Google SGE, moved out of beta and became available to all subscribers \u2014 just in time for the third iteration of DALL-E to enter public beta. Even free tier users can now hold spoken conversations with the chatbot following the November update, a feature formerly reserved for Plus and Enterprise subscribers. What\u2019s more, OpenAI has announced GPTs, little single-serving versions of the larger LLM that function like apps and widgets and which can be created by anyone, regardless of their programming skill level.\n\nThe company has also suggested that it might be entering the AI chip market at some point in the future, in an effort to shore up the speed and performance of its API services. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously pointed to industry-wide GPU shortages for the service\u2019s spotty performance. Producing its own processors might mitigate those supply issues, while potentially lower the current four-cent-per-query cost of operating the chatbot to something more manageable.\n\nBut even those best laid plans were very nearly smashed to pieces just before Thanksgiving when the OpenAI board of directors fired Sam Altman, arguing that he had not been \"consistently candid in his communications with the board.\"\n\nThat firing didn't take. Instead, it set off 72 hours of chaos within the company itself and the larger industry, with waves of recriminations and accusations, threats of resignations by a lion\u2019s share of the staff and actual resignations by senior leadership happening by the hour. The company went through three CEOs in as many days, landing back on the one it started with, albeit with him now free from a board of directors that would even consider acting as a brake against the technology\u2019s further, unfettered commercial development.\n\nAt the start of the year, ChatGPT was regularly derided as a fad, a gimmick, some shiny bauble that would quickly be cast aside by a fickle public like so many NFTs. Those predictions could still prove true but as 2023 has ground on and the breadth of ChatGPT\u2019s adoption has continued, the chances of those dim predictions of the technology\u2019s future coming to pass feel increasingly remote.\n\nThere is simply too much money wrapped up in ensuring its continued development, from the revenue streams of companies promoting the technology to the investments of firms incorporating the technology into their products and services. There is also a fear of missing out among companies, S&P Global argues \u2014 that they might adopt too late what turns out to be a foundationally transformative technology \u2014 that is helping drive ChatGPT\u2019s rapid uptake.\n\nThe calendar resetting for the new year shouldn\u2019t do much to change ChatGPT\u2019s upward trajectory, but looming regulatory oversight might. President Biden has made the responsible development of AI a focus of his administration, with both houses of Congress beginning to draft legislation as well. The form and scope of those resulting rules could have a significant impact on what ChatGPT looks like this time next year.\n\nThis article contains affilate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission."

Today, the EFL is comprised of the second-tier Championship, third-tier League One, and fourth-tier League Two. But Premier League clubs are still invited to participate in the League Cup (EFL Cup) every season.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, corporations began paying to attach their name to this tournament and the sponsor names caught on for brief periods when it was known as the Coca-Cola Cup, the Worthington's Cup, and the Carling Cup.\n\nThe latest sponsor is Thai energy drink company Carabao, which bought the title rights of the knockout tournament beginning with the 2017/18 edition, leading to the use of the Carabao Cup moniker that is popularly used today."

    "body": "It is no wonder Mauricio Pochettino spends most of his time watching Chelsea on the edge of the touchline with his hands clasped tightly in his pockets and a tense expression on his face.\n\nEven with his side 2-0 up and cruising against Blackburn thanks to goals from Beno\u00eet Badiashile and a rejuvenated Raheem Sterling, the Chelsea manager was a bundle of nerves throughout what turned out to be a comfortable victory in the end.\n\nBut while the lack of cutting edge that has become a hallmark of the Todd Boehly-era in west London still looms large as he prepares for his first return to table-topping Tottenham on Monday night, Pochettino could take heart from Cole Palmer\u2019s brilliant performance as the former Manchester City forward helped to dispatch Jon Dahl Tomasson\u2019s inexperienced side.\n\nHaving played his part in Badiashile\u2019s opening goal in the defender\u2019s first appearance of the season with a cheeky nutmeg to combine with Conor Gallagher from a quickly-taken corner, Palmer was also involved in Sterling\u2019s goal that sealed this victory in the second half.\n\nQuick Guide Carabao Cup quarter-final draw Show Newcastle will travel to Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup after knocking out both Manchester clubs. Eddie Howe's side followed up their victory over City with a 3-0 win over United at Old Trafford with goals from Miguel Almir\u00f3n, Lewis Hall and Joe Willock. The Magpies will now face five-times winners Chelsea, who beat Championship Blackburn thanks to goals from Beno\u00eet Badiashile and Raheem Sterling at Stamford Bridge. West Ham's reward for a 3-1 victory over Arsenal is a trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool, who edged out Bournemouth 2-1 thanks to Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez's superb winner, while Everton will play Fulham. There will be a team from the English Football League in the semi-finals with League One Port Vale hosting Championship Middlesbrough. PA Media\n\nDraw Everton v Fulham; Chelsea v Newcastle; Port Vale v Middlesbrough; Liverpool v West Ham. Ties to be played week commencing 18 December. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nReece James was also a constant menace to Blackburn\u2019s defence as he started for the first time since the opening day of the season on his return from injury and Pochettino admitted he is delighted to have his captain back.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the best full-backs in the world and to have been without him for so long has been difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to be careful and little by little he will get back to full fitness.\u201d\n\nBlackburn\u2019s fortunes since Andy Cole scored the winning goal that saw off Tottenham in the final of this competition more than 20 years ago under Graeme Souness have seen the Lancashire club drop down to the third tier for a season before coming close to reaching the Championship playoffs in the past two campaigns.\n\nThey currently find themselves 12th after an inconsistent start but Tomasson opted against sending out his first-choice team despite Chelsea\u2019s recent vulnerabilities at home, with the 26-year-old captain Lewis Travis the oldest player he selected.\n\nBeno\u00eet Badiashile opens the scoring for Chelsea from close range in the first half. Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cIt was the millionaires of the Premier League against the youngsters of the Championship,\u201d reflected the former Denmark forward. \u201cWe should be proud of this performance.\u201d\n\nBlackburn certainly managed to cause problems for Chelsea even after the hosts made their intentions clear straight from the kick-off when Nicolas Jackson forced a corner when his shot was blocked. Travis was very lucky not to concede a penalty when he slid in against Sterling after 10 minutes, with no VAR to overrule what looked like a clear and obvious error from the referee Tim Robinson.\n\nIt took a good save from Leopold Wahlstedt to deny James but Blackburn then enjoyed a good period of possession in their opponents\u2019 half. James was inches away from breaking the deadlock midway through the first half but his shot just eluded the far post before Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez forced Wahlstedt to palm away his effort soon afterwards.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not for the first time, Robert S\u00e1nchez was then far too casual as the Chelsea goalkeeper\u2019s pass was almost intercepted.\n\nAlmost 15 minutes had passed by the time Fern\u00e1ndez had Chelsea\u2019s first effort of the second half. Palmer came closer from a tight angle but, having cleared the ensuing corner, Blackburn shot themselves in the foot as they tried to play out. Brittain\u2019s pass was intercepted by Palmer and Sterling curled home from the edge of the area to give Pochettino some welcome breathing space. Jackson should have made it even more comfortable but blazed over from close range before the post denied the outstanding Palmer a goal with a deflected shot.\n\nSterling could and probably should have added to his tally after finding space in behind Blackburn\u2019s defence on more than one occasion in the closing stages. But it was Palmer who was afforded a standing ovation when he was withdrawn at the end as Chelsea\u2019s supporters celebrated only their fourth home win of the season \u2013 three of them in this competition."

    "body": "What is it, really, about Connor Bedard\u2019s shot \u2014 a shot that, though he\u2019s just 18 years old, has for years been talked about as if he has patented it \u2014 that makes it so dangerous and unique?\n\nWhat\u2019s the nerdy science of it, from his feet up to his knees, hips, hands and head? How does he prep, shape and let it go? What does it look like to goalies, and to professional shooting coaches, those who\u2019ve taught him \u2014 or, more accurately, watched him after he taught himself \u2014 and had to stop him? The Athletic spoke with five NHL shooting and skills coaches, his teammates, past opponents and him to try to take apart, piece by piece, \u201cThe Bedard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir intel and stories help frame the NHL\u2019s brightest young star\u2019s signature skill.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Tim Turk knows, it\u2019s shooting. A self-described \u201cshooting and scoring coach,\u201d Turk has more than two decades of experience working with NHL stars, national federations and half a dozen NHL teams.\n\nTurk had no idea who Bedard was when he fielded a call from agent Greg Landry of Newport Sports asking him what he was doing tomorrow.\n\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m booked up a year in advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have these two players coming in from out west and we want you to see them,\u201d Landry said.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m booked up,\u201d Turk said again.\n\n\u201cYou have to see them,\u201d Landry insisted.\n\nAfter moving around his schedule, Turk found himself at Gary Roberts\u2019 personal rink in Uxbridge, Ontario.\n\n\u201cHey guys, I\u2019m Tim Turk,\u201d he said as he stepped into the small locker room.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Nate,\u201d said the redhead, extending a hand.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Connor,\u201d said the other, standing shorter and extending his.\n\n\u201cAll right, well we\u2019re just going to go out and I\u2019m going to do an evaluation on you and do some shooting and have some fun, and I\u2019ll make suggestions but I\u2019m not here to change anything,\u201d Turk said, giving the two boys his usual spiel and thinking nothing of it.\n\nThat evaluation is what he calls an \u201cNHL protocol observation assessment,\u201d which runs new clients through specific drills that allow him to visualize their shooting actions from a technical standpoint (he calls each player\u2019s shot \u201clike a fingerprint\u201d).\n\nThat starts with Turk throwing some pucks down in the slot and simply asking them to shoot them stationary so he can watch their body formation, hip and shoulder positions, spine angles and puck preparation and positioning, paying particular attention to where the puck starts in their stance versus where it finishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that day, Nate (Danielson, the Red Wings\u2019 2023 No. 9 pick) went first, and Turk could tell he was a talented and hard-working player with a good shot and real promise.\n\nThen, on Connor\u2019s turn, Turk placed him in a position and watched how he got the puck ready to shoot. Only Connor didn\u2019t stickhandle and prepare for the shot, he just took the puck and shot it right away.\n\nAfter watching him run through the same number of shots as Nate did, Turk spoke for the first time.\n\n\u201cTimeout one second, just give me a second here, I\u2019m just trying to see what you\u2019re doing so I\u2019m going to have you take an extra few shots so that I can analyze where the puck\u2019s starting and where it\u2019s finishing,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother round later, he knew that this Connor kid, whose last name he still didn\u2019t know and who was then 16, was very different from even his high-end peers simply by his proficiency in shooting from a \u201cfrontal position.\u201d\n\nWhile almost all players point their toes at the net, set the puck at a right angle, load their shot and \u201cdrag it in and then snap it off,\u201d Turk says, on a line of 40 to 50 degrees behind their body or at least level with their heels, Bedard brought the puck in \u201ccompletely lateral.\u201d\n\nInstead of drawing the puck in at a 45-degree angle, he drew it at 180 degrees \u201cright across to the plane of his spine.\u201d Sometimes it even came in at a negative angle. It also happened in a smaller space than it does for other shooters. That lateral inward pull was \u201ccondensed \u2014 it\u2019s compacted.\u201d\n\nTurk says that Vladimir Tarasenko, whom Turk calls one of the NHL\u2019s quickest shooters, takes 18 inches to pull the puck in. Bedard did it all in 12 square inches \u2014 a one-foot box.\n\nTurk\u2019s reaction?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like holy f\u2014,\u201d he said, spelling out the whole profanity, \u201cbecause the only other person that I know who does it quite like that is No. 34 in Toronto (Auston Matthews), and he still doesn\u2019t bring it in as lateral as Bedzy does.\u201d\n\nAfter the stationary shooting, they got into some motion drills.\n\nEvery time Turk introduced a new formation and shot type for Bedard, his application was \u201csimplistic, and he made it look easy.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Tim Turk Hockey (@timturkhockey)\n\nWhen it was over, both kids said, \u201cThis was fun, thanks coach Turky,\u201d and Turk got in his car and drove home.\n\nThe next day, he got another call from Landry asking him what he was doing Thursday because the two boys had asked if they could have him back for another session.\n\n\u201cWell who the f\u2014 are these guys?\u201d Turk finally asked him.\n\n\u201cTurky, it\u2019s Connor Bedard,\u201d Landry said.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Connor Bedard?\u201d Turk asked.\n\nAfter the second session that same week, Turk didn\u2019t work with Bedard again until a stick manufacturer tried to pitch Bedard, who asked if Turk could be there when he test-drove the sticks.\n\nBy then, Turk knew the Bedard name and came away from another session with another takeaway, picking up on Bedard\u2019s eye contact and ability to change his mind mid-shot.\n\n\u201cWhat makes him unique is that he can be selective with it,\u201d Turk said.\n\nWhen he looks back on that first blind introduction, Turk laughs.\n\n\u201cYou know, most, when you\u2019re in a non-pressure, non-stressful situation, you\u2019ll play around with the puck a lot and then you\u2019ll take your shot because I\u2019m telling them to take their time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, when he takes a shot, it looks like he just bends down, picks it up with his hand and places it where he wants to.\n\n\u201cHe believes that \u2018Hey, f\u2014 it, the puck is only two and a half inches wide, I can put it wherever I want.'\u201d\n\nToday, Turk would take Bedard\u2019s shot against anyone\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn a shot release basis only, if I had to bet on who could get the puck off the quickest, with the most deception, with optimal speed, power and accuracy based on a starting point to a finishing point, I\u2019m picking Connor Bedard over Auston Matthews,\u201d Turk said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not taking anything away from Auston. It\u2019s just a little bit different because one\u2019s a righty, one\u2019s a lefty and one\u2019s got a little bit of a higher-angle pull-in change.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Nick Quinn wants people to know about \u201cThe Bedard,\u201d it\u2019s that it isn\u2019t just some natural gift.\n\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand it didn\u2019t happen by accident. Connor\u2019s worked on this since he was little,\u201d said Quinn, an NHL skills coach who has worked with Bedard each summer for several years.\n\nIf there\u2019s another, it\u2019s how hard Bedard\u2019s shot is to defend because he doesn\u2019t show you he\u2019s preparing for it.\n\n\u201cAs replicated in so many other areas of Connor\u2019s game, it\u2019s the deception and elite multi-tasking that catches opponents off guard,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cConnor\u2019s ability to create deception and change the shot angle at top speed is like very few I\u2019ve ever seen. The multi-tasking involved with attempting these shots at top speed is far beyond most player\u2019s capabilities.\u201d\n\nAnother shooting coach, who requested anonymity for this story because he works for another NHL club, pointed to Bedard\u2019s hands and legs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting is how high and left he can get his top hand,\u201d the coach said. \u201cSo many players pull the puck in but can\u2019t get the puck to release from under their body. His footwork is so underrated in that aspect. If you watch his front leg, at times it\u2019s literally in the air at release \u2014 most have their back leg in the air at release. When he transfers his weight, he actually clears space for his hands to get tighter because he\u2019s not afraid to actually lunge into the shot.\u201d\n\nA fourth shooting coach, who hasn\u2019t worked with Bedard and also requested anonymity because he works for another NHL club, expressed a little more hesitancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the minority I\u2019m sure, but I am very curious to see how well his trademark shooting style works at this level,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe really likes to pull pucks right into his feet. I really like his mechanics with his hands off his body and whippy stick \u2014 but I feel this habit makes it easier for elite level \u2018D\u2019 to get stick on puck or in the lanes to block shots. Finding space and time to let that shot go and get clean looks, I think, will be an adjustment.\u201d\n\nFor goalies, it\u2019s the angle change that gets them.\n\nMoose Jaw Warriors goalie Jackson Unger, whom Bedard scored on last year, said the toe-drag release, in particular, is a challenge.\n\n\u201cHe changes the angle so quickly that, as a goalie, you have to adjust to it, but when he does it so fast, it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Unger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of different angles he can give you.\u201d\n\nSabres first-round pick Zach Benson, who has played on teams with and against Bedard and skates with him in the summers, says it\u2019s Bedard\u2019s ability to set up the shot with his agility pre-shot that stands out to him.\n\n\u201cHe can move left to right like no one I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Benson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just trying to get out, face him, and hope it hits ya,\u201d said Scott Ratzlaff, Seattle Thunderbirds goalie and Buffalo Sabres prospect, with a smile. \u201cHe can shoot from anywhere and he\u2019s lethal from anywhere. You\u2019ve just always got to be ready just in case he shoots it. And then he\u2019s got a really good toe drag release, so it\u2019s watching for that and making sure you\u2019re lined up.\u201d\n\nA number of Chicago Blackhawks over the last few decades liked to put in extra time shooting. Patrick Kane would stay out with the young guys, including Alex DeBrincat, well after practice to play shooting games. But even they had a limit.\n\nBedard doesn\u2019t have much of a limit. It\u2019s common for him to be on the ice an hour after practice taking shots from all over the ice. He even got a few other rookies, especially defenseman Kevin Korchinski, to join him on a regular basis. As the media waits for Bedard at his dressing room stall for interviews, he shoots and shoots and shoots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackhawks coach Luke Richardson has been around long enough to see that in a few other special players.\n\n\u201cI know Jaromir Jagr did this for a long time,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cEven at the end of his career \u2014 and he skated around and he had the weights around the bottom of his ankles, practiced full practices like that. It\u2019s happened. That\u2019s their life. They love it so much and they have to be out there. That\u2019s where they feel comfortable and don\u2019t get tired. Hopefully, they go home and have a nap in the afternoon and not watch \u2018Young and the Restless.\u2019 Take it easy and get ready for the next day. It does add up when you put the hours of the week in.\u201d\n\nBedard has downplayed his lengthy post-practice sessions. To him, it\u2019s not like he has weights on his ankles. He\u2019s just shooting, nothing too strenuous.\n\nFor someone who shoots as much as Bedard does, you\u2019d think he would gladly accept being called a shooter. He doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI say it a lot: I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make the right play. If the shot\u2019s there, I\u2019ll take it. Obviously, the goalies are good, you got to hit your spot.\u201d\n\nBlackhawks goalie Arvid S\u00f6derblom would certainly call Bedard a shooter. S\u00f6derblom and Petr Mrazek have faced more shots from Bedard than any NHL goalies this season. The challenge for them is that Bedard doesn\u2019t just shoot one way. He\u2019s unpredictable.\n\n\u201cWhen you have that type of shot, quick release, moves his body and shifts angles on the puck, it makes it harder on the goalies,\u201d S\u00f6derblom said. \u201cYou just saw the two goals (on Sunday against the Florida Panthers), both were quick releases. He finds that open net. He\u2019s a pure goal scorer. It\u2019s fun to have on the team and face him every day and see him take steps, too.\u201d\n\nWhile goalies are trying to figure out Bedard, he\u2019s been putting in the time to do the same with them. For one, he learned to utilize his teammates more. He accumulated plenty of shots on net early in the season, but they were often from distance and more individualistic chances. Then, he scored his first NHL goal on a wraparound and his next three goals off passes from teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll figure out the one-on-one and how to score that way or create chances that way,\u201d Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said. \u201cThere is also an element of working off your teammates. You are in the NHL, so everyone is a pretty good player and you\u2019re able to create using more than just yourself. I think he\u2019s figured that out.\u201d\n\nBedard found more success on the Blackhawks\u2019 last road trip. He left Chicago with five goals in 11 games and returned from Florida with nine goals in 13 games, scoring twice against the Tampa Bay Lightning and again against the Panthers.\n\nBedard wasn\u2019t so reliant on teammates on those goals, either. They were more about the work he\u2019s putting in on the other side of the puck.\n\n\u201cEven in practice, we\u2019ve talked to him about maybe tracking harder and attacking pucks on the forecheck and showing him a couple clips,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cTen, 12 games in, he\u2019s really figuring things out and realizes \u2014 why sit back and let things come to him? Go get it.\u201d\n\nNone of this is surprising to anyone involved. Bedard doesn\u2019t show it if he impresses himself. And as grateful as the Blackhawks are to have drafted Bedard, this is what they expected. This is why teams lined up to take losses last season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the NHL that he was playing in the last few years,\u201d Davidson said, \u201cbut the level of performance and how he could control a game and dominate a game in junior \u2014 it indicated he was going to be able to do that at some point in the NHL. You just never how quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big adjustment, especially when you\u2019re playing against men and being focused on by the other team every single night. I\u2019m excited for him, but I don\u2019t necessarily feel like it\u2019s a huge surprise how quickly he\u2019s started to really find his groove at the NHL level. But it\u2019s exciting to watch.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Ethan Miller / Getty Images)"

    "body": "Although they\u2019ve played eight games, roughly a quarter of their schedule, the USC Trojans basketball team hasn\u2019t really forged an identity.\n\nAndy Enfield\u2019s team has one of the nation\u2019s top freshmen in Isaiah Collier, a senior who most college basketball fans are familiar with in Boogie Ellis, and most recently lost to Gonzaga in Las Vegas 89-76 in a statement game.\n\nThe statement is that they\u2019re not as good as they were expected to be.\n\nUSC posted wins over Kansas State and Seton Hall in November, but lost a tight game to a Oklahoma to end the month and then really struggled against the Bulldogs at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Dec. 2, trailing from start to finish. Gonzaga led by as many as 18 points, overcame Ellis scoring 28 and outscored the Trojans 21-8 on fast breaks.\n\nAt the moment, USC isn\u2019t making the most of a talented roster. We\u2019re about to see whether Bronny James can have a positive impact since he\u2019s expected to make his debut on Sunday against Long Beach State.\n\nBronny James expected to make collegiate debut Sunday\n\nJames, the oldest son of LeBron James, is going to play his first college game on Sunday against Long Beach State after suffering cardiac arrest while practicing this summer. He's expected to be on a minutes restriction, but he\u2019ll be moving into the role that was envisioned for him as an impactful presence off the bench.\n\nHe may immediately provide a boost off the bench since USC can definitely use another body to improve depth.\n\nJames, a guard, is listed at 6-foot-4, weighs 210 pounds, and had a great prep career. ESPN viewed him as a top-20 recruit.\n\nJames excelled in the McDonald\u2019s All-American game, made big plays to aid Team USA\u2019s win in the most recent Hoop Summit and is expected to contribute immediately. It really doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s starting, but whether he\u2019s on the court to close out games will be intriguing to see.\n\nMore college hoops: Best college basketball betting sites | Latest sports betting promos\n\nUSC basketball futures odds to win Pac-12, make Final Four\n\nHere are the latest futures odds for USC at top-rated sportsbooks:\n\nUSC hasn\u2019t done much to enhance or tarnish its resume in the season\u2019s first few weeks. A loss to UC Irvine doesn\u2019t help its at-large chances but isn\u2019t a deal-breaker either. A solid showing in Pac-12 play should see them enter the NCAA Tournament field of 68 comfortably.\n\nWhile UCLA isn\u2019t expected to be as formidable as it has been in years past, Arizona is ranked No. 1 nationally and is basically an even money choice to win the Pac-12 as a clear favorite. At most books, USC is ranked as the second choice to win the conference behind the Wildcats.\n\nThey\u2019re listed as high as to win the National Championship depending on where you shop, so there\u2019s definitely an opportunity to cash in on them if you\u2019re bullish on their ability to improve and blossom into a title contender.\n\nCollier (+3500) and Ellis () have odds on them in the Player of the Year race, with Purdue\u2019s Zach Edey basically an even money favorite since he won last season and is off to a terrific start. Collier, a freshman, has lived up to the hype, averaging 17.3 points, 3.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists through his first eight games.\n\nHe\u2019s scored in double-figures each time out and has set a personal-best with six assists in each of the last two games. One concern is that he went just 2-for-6 from the free-throw line in the loss to Gonzaga, but he had shot the ball reasonably well beforehand so his off night may have just been an aberration.\n\nEllis is one of college basketball\u2019s best scorers, a shot creator who can get hot from the perimeter, so he should also enjoy a strong season in conference play.\n\nSmall forward Kobe Johnson, younger brother of Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, is a great glue guy who can score, rebound and facilitate. 6-foot-6 Washington State transfer DJ Rodman, 6-foot-11 senior Joshua Morgan, 6-foot-11 freshman Arrinten Page and 7-foot-1 sophomore x-factor Vincent Iwuchukwu anchor the frontcourt, so James will have plenty of bodyguards and will presumably get minutes at the guard spots.\n\nIwuchukwu, who had his own health scare last season, was one of the nation\u2019s top recruits and comes off Enfield\u2019s bench. His potential as a game-changer is well known, but he\u2019s striving for consistency. If he and James develop chemistry among the USC reserves, this team is going to be tough to handle over the course of 40 minutes on a nightly basis.\n\nLong Beach State vs. USC odds: Point spread, total\n\nHere are the latest college basketball betting odds for Long Beach vs. USC:\n\nSpread: LBSU 14.5 (-110); USC 14.5 (-110)\n\nTotal: 159.5 (OVER/UNDER -110)\n\nSunday's game against Long Beach State represents USC\u2019s last home game until conference play begins in January. The 49ers are 6-4 and have wins over major conference squads in DePaul and Michigan.\n\nThey upset the Wolverines in Ann Arbor and have beaten Iona, Montana State, and Sacramento State since then, losing to Illinois State and Louisiana. Highly respected head coach Dan Monson leads a solid team that is plenty capable of pulling off an upset at the Galen Center, so tread lightly if you\u2019re wagering on Bronny\u2019s debut.\n\nFollowing this contest, the Trojans will visit Auburn and Alabama State as they venture into the south to prepare for conference play. USC opens Pac-12 play at Oregon and Oregon State late this month before hosting Cal and Stanford. They\u2019ll only be an underdog against the Ducks, so there is a great opportunity on paper to get off to a strong start.\n\nThe Trojans play Arizona and UCLA twice, so their schedule is difficult, but there\u2019s no question there\u2019s enough talent in place to make a run at a title despite what went down last weekend against Gonzaga. If James is special as a difference maker, the Trojans are talented enough to factor into the Pac-12 race."

    "body": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nThere are still tons of Apple Black Friday deals you can shop for online; these are our favorites.\n\nMost of Apple\u2019s current-generation devices went on sale for Black Friday \u2014 and most of those deals look like they\u2019ll carry over through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. That means if you were otherwise occupied on Friday, you can still save on iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, AirPods and more. Some of the prices are new lows and many others match the record prices we\u2019ve seen previously. We\u2019ve tested and reviewed nearly every device below, so check out the links to our full reviews and guides if you need help deciding which deals to snag. These are the best Apple Black Friday deals you can still get today from retailers like Amazon, Target, Best Buy and B&H Photo.\n\nAirPod Black Friday deals\n\nAirPods Pro (2nd gen, USB-C)\n\nWhen Apple announced the new iPhone 15 and its conversion to USB-C charging, the company also revealed the second generation AirPods Pro with the same connector. That version has dropped to $190 at Amazon, Target, Best Buy. They\u2019ve gone or as low as $189 recently, so this is within a dollar of that price. Other than the port, the hardware hasn\u2019t changed so you\u2019re still getting the earbuds we named the best pick for iPhone users in our guide. In addition to pairing well with Apple\u2019s handsets, the buds also offer one of the best transparency modes on the market along with solid ANC and richer fuller sound than the previous generation Pros. The Lightning version is on sale for $169 at Walmart and $185 at Verizon.\n\nRead our full review of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\n\nAirPods Max\n\nThe over-ear AirPods Max are normally far too expensive for us to recommend. But now they're down to $450, which is a new low price and $30 cheaper than Prime Day in October. Get the deal at Amazon or Best Buy. They're $519 at B&H Photo. They are well-designed, comfortable, and implement all of the helpful Siri integrations. We also like the great noise cancellation and Spatial Audio. While they\u2019re a little heavy, the fit is still comfortable and the on-device controls, while unique, are simple and \u201ca joy to use.\u201d\n\nAirPods (3rd gen)\n\nThe third generation AirPods with the Lightning charging case are down to $140 at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. They carry a list price of $169 but often sell for closer to $150, so this is $10 off the usual. These non-Pro AirPods came out in 2021 and got a review score of 88 from us. They pair quickly with iPhones and are a good complement to Siri\u2019s helpfulness. They don\u2019t have ANC however \u2014 you\u2019ll need to go for the AirPods Pro for that feature \u2014 but they do have Adaptive EQ which monitors and adapts sound in real time. The fit is comfortable and they\u2019re water-resistant so they can handle workouts or the weather.\n\nMacBook Black Friday Day deals\n\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, 2023, M3)\n\nThe base model, 14-inch MacBook Pro with the new M3 chip just came out in October but is already$150 off for Black Friday. After testing the new chip, we think the base model with 8GB of RAM may quickly get bogged down. If it's within your budget, we recommend the model with 16GB of RAM, which is $150 off at B&H photo. And if you upgrade to a model with the M3 Pro chip for an even speedier experience \u2014 you'll get a $200 discount as it's down to $2,199 at B&H Photo. We gave the new M3 MacBook Pros an appreciative review and named them the best option for creatives in our buyer\u2019s guide.\n\nRead our review of the new MacBook Pros with the M3 chip\n\nMacBook Air (15-inch, 2023, M2)\n\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air arrived in June and added a little more screen real estate to an already great machine. It\u2019s down to $1,049 for Black Friday at Amazon and Best Buy. That\u2019s the same as the all-time low it\u2019s hit a few times these past couple of months. It's $200 off at B&H Photo. We gave it a 96 in our review and liked how the bigger screen let you get the most out of the M2 processor.\n\nNow that the M3 MacBook Pros have arrived, we\u2019re guessing Apple will come out with M3-enabled Air models in 2024. Still the M2 has plenty of processing power and will serve you well as both a casual machine for playing games and watching shows, but can also hold its own with productivity tasks.\n\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2022, M2)\n\nThe M2-powered, 13-inch MacBook Air is on sale for $929 at B&H Photo. It\u2019s our top recommendation for a MacBook and beat out all brands in our laptop guide. The M2 chip is impressively fast and capable, the design is solid and the display is lovely. It\u2019s more than capable for both work and play and should give you years of dependable use. But, again, the M3-enabled Airs are likely on their way in 2024. So if you know you\u2019re drawn to the newest thing, you might want to wait.\n\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2020, M1)\n\nThe MacBook Air with the M1 chip is a couple years old at this point, but still officially part of Apple\u2019s laptop lineup. It dropped to an all-time low of $750 for October\u2019s Prime Day at Amazon and now Amazon and Best Buy are selling it for the same price. It\u2019s the budget pick in our guide to MacBooks and the top pick in our guide to budget laptops. Check out our review from when it first came out in which we praised its quick speeds, excellent screen and good battery life.\n\nApple Watch Black Friday deals\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n\nPhoto by Cherlynn Low / Engadget Apple Watch Ultra 2 $730 $799 Save $69 with coupon The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has hit a new low price of $730, which is $69 off and cheaper than it was for October's Prime Day. Clip the on-page coupon to get the full deal. Save $69 with coupon $730 at Amazon\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is now $730 with an attached coupon, which is $69 off and a new low price. Get the deal at Amazon or without the coupon at Best Buy for $739. The Ultra 2 has the same new chip as the Apple Watch Series 9 so it can perform the new Double Tap trick, but also sports a more robust build and outdoor-specific features that make it suited to adventurers. There\u2019s a siren to alert people to your presence as well as a dive meter, waypoint setting capabilities and night mode to preserve your low-light vision. It's our recommended Apple Watch for adventurers.\n\nCheck out our guide to the best Apple Watches for 2023\n\nApple Watch Series 9\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 9 is seeing a $70 discount that brings it to $330 at Amazon, Target and Walmart. That's a new low for the wearable. It debuted alongside the iPhone 15 back in September and the big change this time around is a new SiP (system in package) chip that allows for a Double Tap feature that lets you tap your thumb and forefinger together to answer calls and more. It also allows for the onboard processing of Siri requests, making simple demands (like starting a timer or a workout) happen faster.\n\nThe Series 9 has an always-on display and when paired with the Sport Loop is a carbon neutral product. As has been the case for many years now, the Apple Watch is an excellent fitness companion, offering comprehensive health and activity data. It also happens to be our favorite smartwatch for most people.\n\nRead our full review of the Apple Watch Series 9\n\nApple Watch SE\n\nThe most affordable smartwatch in the lineup is the Apple Watch SE, which is now down to $179. It has a list price of $249 but has regularly sold for $220 lately. We called it the best smartwatch money can buy in our review when it came out in 2022. It lacks an always-on display and a few of the more specialized health sensors, like the blood oxygen app, but the fitness features and tracking data are well-rounded, plus the notifications and integrations are particularly convenient for iPhone users.\n\nApple iPad Black Friday deals\n\niPad (9th generation)\n\nApple\u2019s ninth generation standard iPad dropped to a new all-time low of $249 during Amazon\u2019s October Prime Day sale and then hovered at the price for the next few weeks. Now it\u2019s down to $230 at Amazon and Target. It\u2019s not the newest slate, but it\u2019s the recommended budget pick in our guide to the best Apple Tablets because it\u2019s powerful enough for couch surfing, playing Apple Arcade games and watching Netflix \u2014 plus it's the most affordable way to get an iPad.\n\niPad (10th generation)\n\nThe tenth generation iPad is on sale for $349 at Amazon and Target, which is $100 off the list price. It has often sold for $399 lately so this is still $50 off the typical street price. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wild improvement over the previous generation, though it does orient the camera to the landscape edge, which is much better for video calling. The USB-C charging is more modern than the Lightning connector on the 9th gen iPad, but for some reason this model still works with the first generation Apple Pencil (even though the slate came out after the second-gen stylus).\n\niPad Air\n\nThe base model of the latest generation of the iPad Air has an MSRP of $599 and is now down to $499, a price its hit quite a few times in 2023. This is the iPad we recommend for most people because it\u2019s speedy, has a great screen and works with current-generation accessories. It can act as a rather powerful entertainment option for games and streaming, but is powerful enough to serve as a productivity device when paired up with a stylus or mouse and a keyboard. Now that the M3 chip has been loosed upon the world, the iPad Air, which houses the M1 chip, is primed for an update, which will likely come next year (along with a potential price increase).\n\niPad mini\n\nFor a more portable iPad experience, the iPad mini offers a bigger screen than your phone, but is barely as easy to carry around with you. It\u2019s listed at $499, but has dropped as low as $400 many times this year. Now it\u2019s back down to that low at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. The smaller iPad got a refresh last year, adding a new Liquid Retina screen, a Touch-ID top button instead of a Home button, and a USB-C charging. The performance is snappy and the integration with the second-generation Apple Pencil makes it excel as a digital notebook. As we said in our review, with the mini, Apple \u201cquashes notion that \u2018smaller\u2019 means \u2018lesser.\u2019\u201d\n\nApple accessories Black Friday deals\n\n$100 Apple Gift Card + $15 Amazon credit\n\nIf you purchase an Apple gift card totaling $100 or more from the retailer, you can get $15 in Amazon store credit for no extra cost. Just use the code APPLET5USA at checkout to see the offer. The deal applies to the digital version of the card; as of this writing, you can get the credit with a physical Apple gift card as well by using the code APPLET5USAP, though you may not want to clip the coupon on those cards' product page, as Amazon's listing says that will only give you a $10 credit. As a reminder, you can use an Apple gift card for App Store credit, subscription services like Apple Music or iCloud, and/or purchases made at a physical Apple store.\n\nMagic Keyboard\n\nApple's Magic Keyboard is our pick for one of the best iPad accessories you can buy. It's a pretty pricey add-on but now that it's down to $215 at Amazon, it's a little easier to justify. It magnetically attaches to the latest iPad Pros and keeps them \u201cfloating\u201d above the keyboard (which also has a trackpad). We found it comfortable for typing and like that it acts as a cover when closed.\n\nCheck out our guide to the best iPad accessories for 2023\n\nApple AirTags\n\nA four-pack of Apple AirTags is $80 right now at Amazon, thanks to a 19 percent discount. They go for $29 each at full price, so the deal will save you $9 a pop. AirTags are our top picks for Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users as they tap into Apple\u2019s disturbingly vast FindMy network, using other Apple mobiles to find your lost stuff. If you want just a single AirTag, you can grab one for $24 (a $5 discount) at Walmart and Target.\n\nApple Pencil\n\nApple now makes three different Apple Pencils. The original recharges via Lightning. The second generation recharges wirelessly and the new USB-C looks a lot like the first generation, but charges via USB-C instead of lighting. Each one has different iPad compatibility with iPads. While that part is confusing, the pencil itself is rather elegant and one of the best accessories for your iPad. The 1st gen pencil is on sale for $73 at Amazon, while the 2nd generation stylus is down to $89. The USB-C model has an MSRP of $79 but is down to $71 at Amazon.\n\nApple TV 4K\n\nThe Apple TV 4K is our favorite premium streaming device and is currently $125 at B&H Photo. That's not a huge discount, but the streaming box rarely goes on sale. We gave it a 94 in our review because it\u2019s fast, has an excellent Siri remote and integrates seamlessly with Apple\u2019s overall ecosystem. Navigation is clean and easy to use, plus the device can stream in 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision.\n\nMac Mini M2\n\nThe base model of Apple diminutive desktop computer, the Mac mini, is currently on sale for $100 off for Black Friday at Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy. It earned an 86 in our review because it packs a lot of processing power, using the same M2 chip as the two current-model MacBook Airs \u2014 but it\u2019s much cheaper than either laptop.

    "body": "Argentina continue their start to CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying with a home date against Paraguay, the first of two qualifiers for the world champions in this international break.\n\nLionel Messi has been dealing with fitness concerns the past few weeks, missing significant time for his club Inter Miami, but he is on the roster and expected to play a part for the national team. According to a report from Argentina, Messi will not start tonight's match, but he is likely to play much or all of the second half.\n\nHe is helping to usher in a youth movement up front for Argentina, with Julian Alvarez and Alejandro Garnacho considered the future of the forward line. With Angel Di Maria not fit for duty this month, that will be even more in the spotlight here and in the follow-up in Peru.\n\nParaguay were not close to qualifying for the last World Cup, unable to reach a FIFA tournament since 2010. However, with the 2026 World Cup field \u2014 and by extension, qualifying across all federations \u2014 expanding this cycle, Los Guaranies will consider themselves real contenders for a spot and thus points will be at a premium in every match.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Follow along with updates, highlights, and commentary as Argentina meet Paraguay\n\nArgentina vs Paraguay live stream, TV channel\n\nFollowing an agreement at the 11th hour of the September international break, broadcast rights for Argentina's home World Cup qualifiers in the United States have been secured by Telemundo and Univision. That means viewers in the USA can watch this match on Universo, with streaming on Fubo as well as the company's premium subscription services.\n\nThe match is not set to be available globally to regions including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as CONMEBOL has yet to sell broadcast rights to a provider in those territories. The match is, however, available on FIFA+ for free in select territories.\n\nOther territories with broadcast options for this match include Malaysia (Astro Supersport), Argentina (TyC Sports), Brazil (SporTV 2), France (L'Equipe Web), Spain (Movistar), and Saudi Arabia (SSC).\n\nMORE: Watch Premier League matches live with Fubo in USA | Watch EPL in Canada\n\nTV channel Streaming USA Universo Fubo, Telemundo Deportes en Vivo, Universo NOW UK \u2014 \u2014 Australia \u2014 \u2014 Canada \u2014 \u2014 India \u2014 \u2014 New Zealand \u2014 \u2014 Malaysia Astro Supersport Astro Go, sooka Singapore \u2014 \u2014 Hong Kong \u2014 \u2014\n\nWhat time does Argentina vs Paraguay kick off?\n\nThis CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying match at Estadio Monumental kicks off on Thursday, October 12 at 8 p.m. local time in Buenos Aires.\n\nHere's how that time translates across some of the major territories:\n\nDate Kickoff time USA/Canada Thu, Oct. 12 7 p.m. ET USA/Canada Thu, Oct. 12 4 p.m. PT UK Fri, Oct. 13 12 a.m. BST Australia Fri, Oct. 13 9 a.m. AEST India Fri, Oct. 13 4:30 a.m. IST Hong Kong Fri, Oct. 13 7 a.m. HKT Malaysia Fri, Oct. 13 7 a.m. MYT Singapore Fri, Oct. 13 7 a.m. SGT New Zealand Fri, Oct. 13 11 a.m. NZST\n\nArgentina vs Paraguay starting lineups & team news\n\nArgentina head coach Lionel Scaloni named a bloated 36-man squad for the matches against Paraguay and Peru this month, but Angel Di Maria, Paulo Dybala, and Juan Foyth were forced to withdraw due to injury. Lisandro Martinez is also unavailable after having to undergo another foot operation.\n\nNow that Inter Miami's playoff run is officially over, Argentina can feel a little better about deploying Lionel Messi at full 90-minute use despite his recent fitness issues, knowing his club season is nearly over and he'll have months of rest upcoming. Messi missed the last match against Bolivia, and missed four Inter Miami games after, but he returned for a half-hour of action in their final fixture before the international break. However, he doesn't start, but is reportedly fit enough to come off the bench for most or all of the second half.\n\nNicolas Tagliafico started both matches in September, and while Marcos Acuna is back with the team following an injury, the former retains his starting spot. Messi's club teammate Facundo Farias was also included on the roster but it'd be surprising if he saw the field.\n\nMORE: Preview the Argentina vs Paraguay match with picks, predictions, and odds\n\nArgentina starting lineup (4-3-3): E. Martinez (GK) \u2014 Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico \u2014 De Paul, Mac Allister, E. Fernandez \u2014 J. Alvarez, L. Martinez, N. Gonzalez.\n\nNew Paraguay head coach Daniel Garnero, making his debut, has rung the changes after falling to Venezuela last time out, making five alterations to that starting lineup. The entire midfield is swapped out, while Adam Bareiro takes over at striker, earning his debut international cap in place of Gabriel Avalos.\n\nForward Miguel Almiron is Paraguay's most prominent goalscoring threat and is in good form, with three goals in his past five matches for Newcastle United.\n\nParaguay have questions at goalkeeper, as mainstay Antony Silva has been phased out, leaving three inexperienced internationals currently on the roster. New York Red Bulls starter Carlos Coronel earned his first two caps in the September matches and he remains in net here. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami teammate Diego Gomez was named to the Paraguay roster but was forced to withdraw due to injury.\n\nParaguay starting lineup (5-4-1): C. Coronel (GK) \u2014 I. Ramirez, G. Gomez, Balbuena, Alonso, Espinoza \u2014 R Sanchez, Campuzano, Almiron, Bareiro \u2014 Sosa.\n\nArgentina vs Paraguay betting odds & lines\n\nIn Canada, bet CONMEBOL at Sports Interaction: See the latest odds for Argentina vs Paraguay here"

    "body": "Meta has a moderation bias problem, not just a \u2018bug,\u2019 that\u2019s suppressing Palestinian voices Instagram users suspect Meta of shadowbanning content about Palestine. The platform has a history of inherent bias.\n\nEarlier this year, Palestinian-American filmmaker Khitam Jabr posted a handful of Reels about her family\u2019s trip to the West Bank. In the short travel vlogs, Jabr shared snippets of Palestinian culture, from eating decadent meals to dancing at her niece\u2019s wedding.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t been in a decade, so it\u2019s just like, life abroad,\u201d Jabr told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cI would get [anti-Palestine] comments,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t respond [to them] or use my account for 24 hours. I wasn\u2019t even posting anything about the occupation. But fast forward to now and the same shit\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israelis, Israel\u2019s retaliatory airstrikes and total blockade \u2014 cutting access to electricity, water and vital supplies \u2014 have devastated Gaza. In response to the escalating violence, Meta said that it is closely monitoring its platforms for violations and may inadvertently flag certain content, but it never intends to \u201csuppress a particular community or point of view.\u201d Content praising or supporting Hamas, which governs Gaza and is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, is expressly forbidden on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nAs the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows more dire, many social media users suspect Instagram of censoring content about the besieged Palestinian territory, even if that content doesn\u2019t support Hamas. Users have also complained that they\u2019ve been harassed and reported for posting content about Palestine, regardless of whether or not it violates Meta\u2019s policies. Jabr, for example, suspects that Instagram restricted her for 24 hours because other users reported her Palestine travel videos. Most recently, Instagram users accused Meta of \u201cshadowbanning\u201d their Stories about Palestine.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a lengthy history of incidents on Meta platforms that reflect an inherent bias against Palestinian users in its processes, as documented by years of complaints from both inside and outside the company. The company may not intentionally suppress specific communities, but its moderation practices often disproportionately affect Palestinian users.\n\nFor instance, Meta struggles to navigate the cultural and linguistic nuances of Arabic, a language with over 25 dialects, and has been criticized for neglecting to adequately diversify its language resources. The company\u2019s black-and-white policies often preclude it from effectively moderating any nuanced topic, like content that discusses violence without condoning it. Advocacy groups have also raised concerns that Meta\u2019s partnerships with government agencies, such as the Israeli Cyber Unit, politically influence the platform\u2019s policy decisions.\n\nDuring the last violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel in 2021, a report commissioned by Meta and conducted by a third party concluded that the company\u2019s actions had an \u201cadverse human rights impact\u201d on Palestinian users\u2019 right to freedom of expression and political participation.\n\nMeta communications director Andy Stone declined to comment on the record, and pointed TechCrunch to Meta\u2019s newsroom post about the conflict, which was updated on Oct. 18 with a statement addressing the shadowbanning claims.\n\n\u201cOur policies are designed to keep people safe on our apps while giving everyone a voice,\u201d the post stated. \u201cWe apply these policies equally around the world and there is no truth to the suggestion that we are deliberately suppressing voice \u2026 We can make errors and that is why there is an appeals process for people to tell us when they think we have made the wrong decision, so we can look into it.\u201d\n\nThe belief that Meta shadowbans, or limits the visibility of, content about Palestine is not new. In an Instagram Story last year, supermodel and activist Bella Hadid, who is of Palestinian descent, alleged that Instagram \u201cdisabled\u201d her from posting content on her Story \u201cpretty much only when it is Palestine based.\u201d She said she gets \u201cimmediately shadowbanned\u201d when she posts about Palestine, and her Story views drop by \u201calmost 1 million.\u201d\n\nAs soon as Kehlani got super vocal and changed her profile picture to \u201ci stand with Palestine\u201d she got shadowbanned.\n\nJust as they did to Bella Hadid. The propaganda is insane.\n\nTHEY TRY TO SILENCE US. DON\u2019T STOP!!\n\nFREE PALESTINE. \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/4lUvZsUbiA \u2014 Sabby Targaryen \ud83d\udc09 (@whoisitbad) October 14, 2023\n\nMeta blamed technical errors for the removal of posts about Palestine during the 2021 conflict. When reached for comment about these recent claims of shadowbanning, a representative for the company pointed TechCrunch to a Threads post by Stone.\n\n\u201cWe identified a bug impacting all Stories that re-shared Reels and Feed posts, meaning they weren\u2019t showing up properly in people\u2019s Stories tray, leading to significantly reduced reach,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThis bug affected accounts equally around the globe and had nothing to do with the subject matter of the content \u2014 and we fixed it as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nBut many are frustrated that Meta continues to disproportionately suppress Palestinian voices. Leen Al Saadi, a Palestinian journalist currently based in Jordan and host of the podcast \u201cPreserving Palestine,\u201d said she is used to \u201cconstantly being censored.\u201d Her Instagram account was restricted last year after she posted a trailer for the podcast\u2019s first episode, which discussed a documentary about Palestinian street art under occupation.\n\n\u201cPalestinians are currently undergoing two wars,\u201d Al Saadi said. \u201cThe first is with their legal occupier. The second war is with the entire Western media landscape, and when I say the entire landscape, I mean social media.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s alleged shadowbanning\n\nInstagram users accuse Meta of suppressing more than just Stories related to Palestine.\n\nCreators say engagement on their posts tanked specifically after they publicly condemned Israel\u2019s response to the Hamas attack as excessively violent. Some, like Jabr, say they were restricted from posting or going live, while others say Instagram flagged their content as \u201csensitive,\u201d limiting its reach. Users also allege their posts were flagged as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and removed, even if the content adhered to Instagram\u2019s Community Guidelines.\n\nMeta\u2019s representative didn\u2019t address the other accusations of censorship beyond just Story visibility and did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s follow-up questions. When asked for comment, Stone directed TechCrunch to Meta\u2019s updated newsroom post, which said Meta identified and fixed a \u201cbug\u201d that prevented users from going live.\n\n\u201cThis was also a global issue that was fixed within a few hours. We understand people rely on these tools and we\u2019re sorry to anyone who felt the impact of these issues,\u201d the post stated.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this \u201cbug\u201d impacted accounts posting content unrelated to Gaza. Instagram users have posted screenshots showing that Stories about Palestine have received significantly fewer views than other Stories posted on the same day, and allege that their view counts went back up when they posted content unrelated to the conflict.\n\nofc IG\u2019s hiding my stories about Palestine, y\u2019all see the difference? lmaoaoaoao pic.twitter.com/1iYIIKBhtN \u2014 \u0f12\ufe0e (@arxbprince) October 15, 2023\n\nA user based in Egypt, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of harassment, said her posts usually get around 300 views, but when she started posting pro-Palestine content after the Hamas attack earlier this month, her stories would only get one to two views.\n\n\u201cIt happened to all my friends, too,\u201d she continued. \u201cThen we noticed that posting a random pic would get higher views. So by posting a random pic, then a pro-Palestine post, would increase the views.\u201d\n\nAnother Instagram user based in the United Kingdom, who also asked to stay anonymous out of fear of harassment, said that his view count returned to normal when he posted a cat photo.\n\n\u201cMy stories went from 100s of views to zero or a handful,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to post intermittent non-Gaza content in order to \u2018release\u2019 my stories to be viewed again.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Stories. The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement (7amleh), which documents cases of Palestinian digital rights violations and works directly with social media companies to appeal violations, told TechCrunch it has received reports of Instagram inconsistently filtering comments containing the Palestinian flag emoji. Users report that Instagram has flagged comments containing the emoji as \u201cpotentially offensive,\u201d hiding the comment.\n\nMeta initially did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. When asked for comment, Stone pointed TechCrunch to Meta\u2019s updated newsroom post, which did not directly address issues related to comments containing the Palestinian flag.\n\nThe organization has also received countless reports of Meta flagging and restricting Arabic content, even if it\u2019s posted by news outlets. Jalal Abukhater, 7amleh\u2019s advocacy manager, said that the organization has documented multiple cases of journalists on Instagram reporting the same news in Arabic, Hebrew and English, but only getting flagged for their Arabic content.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally journalistic content, but the same wording in Hebrew and English does not get restricted,\u201d Abukhater said. \u201cAs if there\u2019s better moderation for those languages, and more careless moderation for Arabic content.\u201d\n\nStone declined to comment on allegations of Meta disproportionately flagging Arabic news content, instead directing TechCrunch to the updated newsroom post \u2014 which did not directly address the allegations.\n\nAnd as the Intercept reported, Instagram and Facebook are flagging images of the al-Ahli Hospital, claiming that the content violates Meta\u2019s Community Guidelines on nudity or sexual activity.\n\nThe Community Guidelines are enforced inconsistently, particularly when it comes to content related to Palestine. Al Saadi recently tried to report a comment that said she should be \u201craped\u201d and \u201cburned alive\u201d \u2014 left in response to her comment on a CNN post about the conflict \u2014 but in screenshots reviewed by TechCrunch, Instagram said that it didn\u2019t violate the platform\u2019s Community Guidelines against violence or dangerous organizations.\n\n\u201cThe restrictions on content, especially the content that relates to Palestine, is heavily politicized,\u201d Abukhater said. \u201cIt feeds into the bias against Palestinian narrative genuinely. It really takes the balance against Palestinians in a situation where there\u2019s a huge asymmetry of power.\u201d\n\nA history of suppression\n\nContent about Palestine is disproportionately scrutinized, as demonstrated during the last severe violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel two years ago. Amid the violence following the May 2021 court ruling to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, users across Facebook and Instagram accused Meta of taking down posts and suspending accounts that voiced support for Palestinians.\n\nThe digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) described Meta\u2019s actions in 2021 as \u201csystemic censorship of Palestinian voices.\u201d In its 2022 report of Palestinian digital rights, 7amleh said that Meta is \u201cstill the most restricting company\u201d compared to other social media giants in the extent of its moderation of the Palestinian digital space.\n\nMeta forbids support of terrorist organizations, like most social media companies based in the U.S., but struggles to moderate content around it, from user discourse to journalistic updates. This policy, along with the company\u2019s partnership with Israel to monitor posts that incite violence, complicates things for Palestinians living under Hamas\u2019 governance. As EFF points out, something as simple as Hamas\u2019 flag in the background of an image can result in a strike.\n\nJillian York, the director for international freedom of expression for EFF, blames automation and decisions made by \u201cminimally trained humans\u201d for the inconsistency. Meta\u2019s zero tolerance policy and imprecise enforcement often suppress content from or about conflict zones, she said. The site\u2019s moderation issues have negatively affected multiple non-English speaking regions, including Libya, Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThese rules can prevent people from sharing documentation of human rights violations, documentation of war crimes, even just news about what\u2019s happening on the ground,\u201d York continued. \u201cAnd so I think that is what is the most problematic right now about that particular rule, and the way that it\u2019s enforced.\u201d\n\nOver the 13 days leading up to the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, 7amleh documented more than 500 reports of Palestinian \u201cdigital rights violations,\u201d including the removal and restriction of content, hashtags and accounts related to the conflict.\n\nMeta blamed some of the instances of perceived censorship to technical issues, like one that prevented users in Palestine and Colombia from posting Instagram Stories. It attributed others to human error, like blocking the hashtag for Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holy site where Israeli police clashed with Ramadan worshippers, because it was mistaken for a terrorist organization. The company also blocked journalists in Gaza from WhatsApp without explanation.\n\nThe same month, a group of Facebook employees filed internal complaints accusing the company of bias against Arab and Muslim users. In internal posts obtained by BuzzFeed News, an employee attributed the bias to \u201cyears and years of implementing policies that just don\u2019t scale globally.\u201d\n\nAt the recommendation of its Oversight Board, Meta conducted a third-party due diligence report about the platform\u2019s moderation during the May 2021 conflict. The report found that Arabic content was flagged as potentially violating at significantly higher rates than Hebrew content was, and was more likely to be erroneously removed. The report noted that Meta\u2019s moderation system may not be as precise for Arabic content as it was for Hebrew content, because the latter is a \u201cmore standardized language,\u201d and suggested that reviewers may lack the linguistic and cultural competence to understand less common Arabic dialects like Palestinian Arabic.\n\nHas anything improved?\n\nMeta committed to implementing policy changes based on the report\u2019s recommendations, such as updating its keywords associated with dangerous organizations, disclosing government requests to remove content and launching a hostile speech classifier for Hebrew content. Abukhater added that Meta has improved its response to harassment, at least in comparison to other social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Although harassment and abuse are still rampant on Instagram and Facebook, he said, the company has been responsive to suspending accounts with patterns of targeting other users.\n\nThe company has also made more contact with regional Palestinian organizations since 2021, York added, but it\u2019s been slow to implement recommendations from EFF and other advocacy groups. It\u2019s \u201cvery clear\u201d that Meta is not putting the same resources behind Arabic and other non-English languages, York said, compared to the attention Meta gives to countries that have the most regulatory pressure. Moderation of English and other European languages tends to be more comprehensive, for example, because the EU enforces the Digital Services Act.\n\nIn Meta\u2019s response to the report, Miranda Sissons, the company\u2019s director of human rights, said that Meta was \u201cassessing the feasibility\u201d of reviewing Arabic content by dialect. Sissons said that the company has \u201clarge and diverse teams\u201d who understand \u201clocal cultural context across the region,\u201d including in Palestine. Responding to the escalating violence earlier this month, Meta stated that it established a \u201cspecial operations center\u201d staffed with fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers to closely monitor and respond to violating content.\n\nDespite Meta\u2019s apparent efforts to diversify its language resources, Arabic is still disproportionately flagged as violating \u2014 like in the case of journalists reporting news in multiple languages.\n\n\u201cThe balance of power is very fixed, in reality, between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d Abukhater said. \u201cAnd this is something that today is reflected heavily on platforms like Meta, even though they have human rights teams releasing reports and trying to improve upon their policies. Whenever an escalation like the one we\u2019re experiencing now happens, things just go back to zero.\u201d\n\nAnd at times, Meta\u2019s Arabic translations are completely inaccurate. This week, multiple Instagram users raised concerns over the platform mistranslating the relatively common Arabic phrase \u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d or \u201cPraise be to God.\u201d In screen recordings posted online, users found that if they included \u201cPalestinian\u201d and the corresponding flag emoji in their Instagram bio along with the Arabic phrase, Instagram automatically translated their bio to \u201cPalestinian terrorists \u2013 Praise be to Allah\u201d or \u201cPraise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.\u201d When users removed \u201cPalestinian\u201d and the flag emoji, Instagram translated the Arabic phrase to \u201cThank God.\u201d Instagram users complained that the offensive mistranslation was active for hours before Meta appeared to correct it.\n\nShayaan Khan, a TikTok creator who posted a viral video about the mistranslation, told TechCrunch that Meta\u2019s lack of cultural competence isn\u2019t just offensive, it\u2019s dangerous. He said that the \u201cglitch\u201d can fuel Islamophobic and racist rhetoric, which has already been exacerbated by the war in Gaza. Khan pointed to the fatal stabbing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American child whose death is being investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMeta did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment about the mistranslation. Abukhater said that Meta told 7amleh that a \u201cbug\u201d caused the mistranslation. In a statement to 404 Media, a Meta spokesperson said that the issue had been fixed.\n\n\u201cWe fixed a problem that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations in some of our products,\u201d the statement said, \u201cWe sincerely apologize that this happened.\u201d\n\nAs the war continues, social media users have tried to find ways around the alleged shadowbanning on Instagram. Supposed loopholes include misspelling certain words, like \u201cp@lestine\u201d instead of \u201cPalestine,\u201d in hopes of bypassing any content filters. Users also share information about Gaza in text superimposed over unrelated images, like a cat photo, so it won\u2019t be flagged as graphic or violent content. Creators have tried to include an emoji of the Israeli flag or tag their posts and Stories with #istandwithisrael, even if they don\u2019t support the Israeli government, in hopes of gaming engagement.\n\nAl Saadi said that her frustration with Meta is common among Palestinians, both in occupied territories and across the diaspora.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re asking for is to give us the exact same rights,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for more. We\u2019re literally just asking Meta, Instagram, every single broadcast channel, every single media outlet, to just give us the respect that we deserve.\u201d\n\nDominic-Madori Davis contributed to this story\u2019s reporting."

    "body": "Norway\u2019s data protection authority has asked a European Union regulator to take a binding decision on whether its emergency sanction on Facebook and Instagram tracking and profiling users for ad targeting without their consent should be made permanent and applied across the EU single market, not just locally.\n\nThe move could lead to a blanket ban on Meta running tracking ads without consent across the EU single market if the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) agrees the action is merited. Meta may also switch to asking users for their permission to run \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d before any Board action, as it has claimed it intends to.\n\nThe Datatilsynet issued a local ban on Meta tracking and profiling users without consent back in July \u2014 using powers in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which enable concerned regulators to apply temporary measures (lasting for three months) in their markets if they see an urgent need to act to protect citizens\u2019 data. So while Meta\u2019s lead regulator for the GDPR remains the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which would normally lead on any enforcement, the Norwegian DPA\u2019s emergency action circumvents the regulation\u2019s so-called \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d mechanism \u2014 and gives the Norwegian authority the option to refer ongoing concerns to the EDPB, as it has now done.\n\nMeta has continued to flout the Datatilsynet order \u2014 which includes a daily fine of up to one million NOK (~$100,000) per day for non-compliance \u2014 ignoring the authority\u2019s requirement not to run tracking ads without permission, per a spokesperson for the DPA.\n\nThe tech giant instead sought a court injunction against the order. However, earlier this month, an Oslo court rejected Meta\u2019s arguments, affirming the DPA\u2019s right to act.\n\nReached by email the EDPB confirmed receipt of the authority\u2019s request. \u201cThe EDPB Secretariat will now assess completeness of the file. Once this assessment is complete, the deadline under art. 66(4) GDPR starts running and the Board will have two weeks to adopt its urgent binding decision,\u201d a spokeswoman told us.\n\nShe declined to offer any steer on how long the Board\u2019s assessment of the Datatilsynet\u2019s request will take to complete.\n\nThe Board already took one binding decision vis-a-vis Meta ads: Late last year it settled a dispute between DPAs on a complaint against the legal basis the adtech giant claimed for running the ads \u2014 which led on, in January, to a final decision being issued by the DPC rejecting Meta\u2019s claim of contractual necessity to justify the processing.\n\nSince then Meta tried another switch of legal basis for the processing \u2014 to a claim of legitimate interests \u2014 but the EU\u2019s top court quashed that gambit with a ruling in July, related to a separate challenge brought by Germany\u2019s competition authority, which confirmed Meta cannot claim a legitimate interest to run its \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d in the absence of user consent.\n\nThat landmark strike was followed at the start of August by Meta announcing an \u201cintention\u201d to legalize its tracking ads business in the region by asking users for their permission. But it has still not done so \u2014 continuing to run unlawful ads. Hence why the Norwegian DPA decided to take emergency action \u2014 pointing out that millions of EU people\u2019s rights are being infringed.\n\nReached for a response to the DPA\u2019s referral the EDPB, Meta spokesperson, Matt Pollard, sought to deflect attention off-of the current lack of compliance \u2014 writing in an emailed statement:\n\nWe are surprised by the NDPA\u2019s [Norwegian data protection authority\u2019s] actions, given that Meta has already committed to moving to the legal basis of consent for advertising in the EU/EEA. We remain in active discussions with the relevant data protection authorities on this topic via our lead regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and will have more to share in due course.\n\nAsked when Meta will be moving to a lawful basis for tracking and profiling users in the region Pollard declined to specify a timeframe. \u201cWe have not announced a date. We are still working through with policymakers what our transition to Consent will look like, and will have more to share in due course,\u201d he added.\n\nThe referral to the EDPB may concentrate minds at Meta on the need to make good on its pledge to ask users\u2019 permission sooner rather than later.\n\nThe company has sought to get ahead of events on this issue by using PR tactics that present a narrative where it appears to retain some control (hence its blog post sketching a future \u201cintention\u201d to switch to consent, just without fixing a date \u2014 so keeping control of the timings and seeking to normalize the ongoing delay to rectifying its unlawful \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d); even as EU regulators have, collectively, forced the looming paradigm shift to its privacy-hostile business model.\n\nThe bottom line here is that, in the not-too-distant future, surveillance capitalism\u2019s poster child will \u2014 at least in a major international region for its business \u2014 have to end the consentless tracking and profiling it exploited for years to build up its adtech empire, at the expense of web users\u2019 privacy.\n\nIn the meanwhile, people in the EU\u2019s single market are once again being directed to wait on Ireland\u2019s DPC to enforce their privacy rights. But if the Irish authority is too slow to rectify Meta\u2019s lack of consent this time there is now the backstop option of the Board stepping in a second time and finishing the job for it."

    "body": "Chelsea Women had created a frenzy. On Nov. 4, the English club released a statement saying their coach Emma Hayes was leaving at the end of the season to \u201cpursue a new opportunity outside of the Women\u2019s Super League and club football.\u201d Hayes had just entered her second decade in charge of the club, and few knew where she would land next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same day The Athletic, among others, reported that Hayes\u2019 next job would be with the U.S. women\u2019s national team, leading a four-time World Cup and Olympic gold medal-winning program into a new era. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer made her appointment official.\n\nHayes, who previously won six WSL titles in England, will become the 10th full-time coach of the U.S., but not until her final season with Chelsea is complete next May. Sporting director Matt Crocker made the final decision to hire Hayes after a search process that began in August, following the team\u2019s surprising exit in the round of 16 at the World Cup and the subsequent departure of head coach Vlatko Andonovski.\n\n\u201cShe has tremendous energy and an insatiable will to win,\u201d U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement. \u201cHer experience in the USA, her understanding of our soccer landscape and her appreciation of what it means to coach this team makes her a natural fit for this role and we could not be more pleased to have her leading our women\u2019s national team forward.\u201d\n\nThough Hayes is seen as one of the world\u2019s top coaches in women\u2019s soccer, the appointment still comes as something of a surprise. Here\u2019s how the deal got done.\n\nDetails of the deal\n\nAt least part of the surprise surrounding Hayes\u2019 hire \u2013 and the six-month runway before she officially takes charge \u2013 is down to U.S. Soccer\u2019s own messaging. Crocker, in a September meeting with U.S. reporters along with Cone and U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson, said he hoped to have a new head coach in place by December.\n\nBut the initial contact with Hayes was made a couple of months ago, early into the search, with all three top-level executives from U.S. Soccer involved in those talks. The trio also described the interview process to journalists in that September meeting \u2013 a U.S. soccer statement describes it as involving \u201cpsychometrics and abstract reasoning tests, in-depth discussions of strategy, coaching philosophy and the current player pool, as well as evaluation on the reactions to pressure, culture-building and interactions with players and staff.\u201d USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter went through a similar process, including an abstract reasoning test, when he was re-hired by Crocker earlier in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hiring process included multiple rounds of evaluation, with the list of candidates becoming smaller each time. The first pass was driven purely by data, which was then whittled down to a double-digit list Crocker was considering as of September, and then a final shortlist, which also included Tony Gustavsson, head coach of Australia. Multiple sources confirmed both Hayes and Gustavsson flew to the U.S. for interviews.\n\nOne source who was briefed on the situation said the federation had also checked in on the availability of Sarina Wiegman, despite clear messaging from both the English FA and Wiegman herself in August. \u201cI\u2019m staying out of it. I\u2019ve heard it (from the press officer) but no, I\u2019m with England and I\u2019m really happy with England, and I have a contract until 2025,\u201d Wiegman said. A representative from her camp declined to comment for this story.\n\nCrocker said in September that the final interviews would include lengthy technical and tactical assessments, as well as questions to determine the candidates\u2019 cultural fit. He and the federation stayed fairly consistent on their desired start date since the head coach role opened in August, but that became one of the major concessions made by U.S. Soccer in selecting Hayes.\n\nShe\u2019s headed Stateside \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 U.S. Soccer has appointed Emma Hayes as the 10th full-time head coach in #USWNT history \u00bb https://t.co/sR7qfSnWVx Welcome, Emma! pic.twitter.com/WYn6Sg9RmX \u2014 U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) November 14, 2023\n\nHayes will remain exclusively with Chelsea through the end of their WSL campaign and the Champions League season. She will not work with the U.S. in international windows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here until the end,\u201d she said in her press conference on Friday. \u201cI haven\u2019t died, I haven\u2019t gone anywhere. I\u2019m here, doing this job. My full focus and attention is on what I do for Chelsea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes could be tied up with Chelsea as late as May 25 if the London club makes the Champions League final; notably, an international window that would theoretically be Hayes\u2019 first in charge begins just two days later, on May 27.\n\nHowever, there are ways in which the arrangement will benefit U.S. Soccer. The federation won\u2019t owe any compensation to Chelsea, and Hayes will be fully committed to the program, with a move to Chicago in the works for next year following the completion of her time in London. Eventually, she\u2019s expected to relocate to Atlanta thanks to U.S. Soccer\u2019s planned combined headquarters and national training facility in Georgia. As of yet, there\u2019s no targeted date set for the move.\n\nHayes, too, will benefit in ways other than compensation and prestige. She spoke to reporters about looking forward to spending more time with her five-year-old son, Harry. She has never been to one of his sports days, picked him up from school or taken him to an after-school club and she wants to do that.\n\nThe main visible wrinkle in the process was Chelsea\u2019s surprise move of announcing Hayes\u2019 departure on Saturday, Nov. 4. With the contract not yet finalized and U.S. Soccer board approval still needed, Chelsea issued their statement at 11 a.m. ET in the U.S. in which it noted she would leave at the end of the season \u201cto pursue a new opportunity outside of the WSL and club football.\u201d The club feared that the news was starting to leak and wanted to share the news on its own. This began the race to confirm Hayes had been selected as the USWNT head coach.\n\nTalks between U.S. Soccer and Hayes\u2019 representatives continued even after Chelsea\u2019s press release. The federation\u2019s board convened late on Saturday, Nov. 4 to approve the selection, even without the final details of the contract settled or signed.\n\nAt the end of it all, the sides have agreed to a deal that will make Hayes the highest-paid women\u2019s football coach in the world \u2014 though her salary is not tied to equal compensation with Berhalter. While her salary is in the same range as the USMNT head coach, it\u2019s thought to be a reflection of the market value for Hayes. With reports that Chelsea was prepared to quadruple her salary to keep her, Hayes herself danced around the details in her first media availability with the club.\n\n\u201cI believe in private conversations,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m disappointed to hear things being said in the press. I want to make sure I maintain my own professionalism in everything I do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S Soccer\u2019s annual financial reports reveal the salaries of their head coaches and other executives. While Berhalter received a new contract this year, his previous deal that ran from April 2021 to March 2022, earned him $1.6 million, including $300,000 in bonuses. During that same time, Andonovski earned $446,495, of which only $50,000 was bonus money. With Hayes expected to earn close to $2 million per year in her deal, this will likely create a knock-on effect for other international women\u2019s coaches negotiating their next contracts.\n\nU.S. Soccer\u2019s rollout of their new head coach has not been an easy one for the federation\u2019s communications staff, considering that Hayes is essentially unavailable for any formal ceremonies or media appearances until her time with Chelsea is complete.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge honor to be given the opportunity to coach the most incredible team in world football history,\u201d she said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe feelings and connection I have for this team and for this country run deep. I\u2019ve dreamed about coaching the USA for a long time so to get this opportunity is a dream come true. I know there is work to do to achieve our goals of winning consistently at the highest levels. To get there, it will require dedication, devotion and collaboration from the players, staff and everyone at the U.S. Soccer Federation.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead for the USWNT\n\nHayes\u2019 appointment will have an immediate impact, even if she\u2019s not immediately present. The particulars around timing and the plan moving forward have been one of the areas of discussion between Hayes and her representatives, Chelsea and U.S. Soccer that has continued through the start of November.\n\nUnless the situation changes drastically, Hayes will only have two camps, including four friendlies, with the USWNT ahead of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. She\u2019ll miss three international windows between Tuesday\u2019s announcement and her planned start date, including the 2024 CONCACAF Gold Cup in February and March.\n\nU.S. Soccer has a plan in place for the transition. Current interim head coach Twila Kilgore will continue in the role through May and will remain as a permanent assistant coach under Hayes after the swap is complete. U.S. Soccer said that Kilgore and the rest of the technical staff are working on a handoff plan for Hayes.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique situation, but the team is in safe hands with Twila,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cHer stewardship will be crucial during this period as we are focused on success at the Olympics. Emma has endorsed Twila, she will be a key part of Emma\u2019s staff when she arrives and moving forward, and we are excited for what\u2019s to come with our USWNT program.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER How Emma Hayes' winning ways at Chelsea can benefit USWNT on the field\n\nIt\u2019s still an extremely tight turn for the Olympics, with 18 days for Hayes to get situated with the team ahead of the tournament, between the two international windows from May 27 to June 4, then July 8 to 16. The Olympic tournament will start on July 25.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are, of course, logistical questions about roster selection over the next few months. Some of those may be answered relatively soon, with the roster for the upcoming camp that begins at the end of the month imminent. The greater challenge will likely be ongoing player evaluation over the next six months, at a time of great transition within the squad. The specifics of how that will work without Hayes\u2019 involvement remain a mystery. It would be understandable for players to feel like they are still auditioning for an absent director until May rolls around, while still knowing they must perform at the USWNT standard.\n\nAlong these same lines, there is at least the suggestion that the federation could be willing to sacrifice coherent preparation for this upcoming Olympic tournament to focus more on the longer-term project of the 2027 World Cup. That itself represents a marked change from the expectations and pressure of constant performance and winning that the team is known for.\n\nIs that a good or a bad thing? Perhaps a little bit of both. The USWNT shouldn\u2019t be ruled out of contention for the Olympics by any stretch, but this past summer\u2019s World Cup did reveal that the problems facing the team are far more foundational than just poor coaching decisions or the strange midfield chemistry. Balancing realism with the pressure to win feels like a much more sustainable path forward for the USWNT.\n\nGO DEEPER USWNT's Emma Hayes hire could create a problem in preparation for the Olympics\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Chelsea?\n\nQuestions surrounding Hayes\u2019 future have cropped up previously in her tenure at Chelsea. She was linked to several jobs in the men\u2019s English Football League in the past and has always been interested in managing Spain\u2019s national team, although there was never an official conversation with Spain\u2019s federation. So it was a question of when, not if, Hayes would leave. Still, news of her decision came as a shock to her staff and players.\n\nA few staff members were told on the morning of Nov. 4 before Chelsea\u2019s away game at Aston Villa kicked off at 12.30 p.m. UK time. Most of the other staff members found out with the players in the post-match meeting minutes before the official club statement, which Hayes had no hand in writing and did not even see before publication, was released at 3 p.m.\n\nEngland and Chelsea captain Millie Bright was \u201cdevastated,\u201d and most players were understandably sad \u2014 many of whom owe their career progression to Hayes \u2014 but know they still have a job to do this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind. As a player and a person, I was devastated. I\u2019ve been here nine years under Emma and the things I\u2019ve learned,\u201d Bright said. \u201cShe\u2019s a mentor, a coach, a friend, a life coach. It\u2019s more than just football playing under her.\u201d\n\nBright credits Hayes for her on and off-field guidance. (Photo by Marc Atkins, Getty Images)\n\nHayes\u2019 American assistant Denise Reddy, born in New Jersey, is likely to follow her across the pond. The former United States Under-20 coach has remained faithful to her friend of 20 years and voluntarily quit her job as assistant at Chicago Red Stars in 2010 when Hayes was fired as head coach. Chelsea\u2019s general manager Paul Green will stay at the club. It is unclear whether any other members of Chelsea\u2019s technical staff are expected to depart.\n\nGO DEEPER What next for Chelsea after Emma Hayes?\n\nThe relentless nature of managing a club takes its toll and after what will be 12 years at Chelsea come the end of the season, Hayes, a single parent whose father died last month, decided that it was the right time for a change, professionally and personally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe biggest factors are my son, leaving at the top and giving the club enough time to be able to transition without there being too much disruption,\u201d she said in her press conference.\n\nThe club has received several applications regarding Hayes\u2019 replacement but has not yet started an official recruitment process. She will meet with Chelsea\u2019s technical directors once a week to create a succession plan and will have a say in who takes the job after her.\n\nThere is the possibility of Hayes retaining a connection to the club via some sort of ambassadorial role, but it\u2019s likely contingent upon a lack of conflict with the USWNT role and responsibilities. Under American Todd Boehly\u2019s co-ownership, expanding Chelsea\u2019s profile and reach in the U.S. would make sense, especially with USWNT internationals Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel playing their club football there \u2014 and CBS Sports holding WSL rights.\n\nThere is, for now, an immediate task for Hayes to focus on. Chelsea faces off against Real Madrid on Wednesday for their first match of the UWCL Champions League group stage. Her full American arrival will not come for another half a year after that.\n\n(Top photo: Julian Finney/Getty Images)"

    "body": "It was the moment when Reece James simply could not handle the frustration. Named by Mauricio Pochettino as the Chelsea captain, James had not played since the opening weekend draw with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge when he injured a hamstring. Now, he seethed from the sideline as his team lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa, a game in which his replacement, Malo Gusto, was controversially sent off.\n\nIt was 24 September, Chelsea\u2019s second home Premier League defeat on the spin after the one against Nottingham Forest and they were booed off again. James would lose his cool with an official in the tunnel and, when a Football Association charge was announced three days later for abusive conduct, it felt like only a matter of time before he was given a one-match ban.\n\nIt did not come in time for Chelsea\u2019s visit to Fulham on 2 October, when James was still injured. That would have been too simple. Rather for their next game at Burnley on 7 October when, according to Pochettino, James was back in contention for selection.\n\nThe 23-year-old was not called up by England for the internationals over this past window and the idea was that he would work to be ready for Saturday\u2019s home derby against Arsenal. And yet there have been stories of an injury setback, even that he may need surgery to get to the root of his hamstring issues.\n\nPochettino bustled his way through those questions on Friday and the best read on James\u2019s status was that he would be back in the squad for Arsenal, most likely as a substitute. Gusto is available again after his own suspension. \u201cIt [James\u2019s hamstring] is much better,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe is progressing well, still not at his best, 100%. But maybe to help the team at some point \u2026. maybe, he is close to be there.\u201d\n\nIt has not been straightforward and it seems to remain that way. Yet there were two takeaways from Pochettino on James \u2013 with a common thread running through them. First, James could be like a coiled spring when he finally returns to action. And second, Pochettino was in no mood to criticise him for his indiscipline. On the contrary. He was happier to talk up James\u2019s passion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the business,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe was upset about the situation [against Villa] and then you need to understand that he is so committed to this project from the beginning. He feels really bad because he cannot help the team [because of his injury].\n\n\u201cHe made a mistake, we all make them and he was really sorry about it. I think he\u2019s not going to repeat the situation. This is a young guy that wants to play football. He was frustrated and he made a mistake. That\u2019s it. Finish.\u201d\n\nPochettino made James his captain because of \u201chis personality, his leadership, the respect he has from the club and his teammates \u2026 he has Chelsea DNA\u201d. He described him as an appointment \u201cfor the present and the future \u2013 we cannot change captain every season, every six months\u201d.\n\nIt is also easy to imagine that Pochettino sees something of himself in James; the self-belief, the running on the emotions of a match day. Pochettino made the point that he had got himself booked for dissent during the Burnley game. And then there is his connection with the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta; there are similarities, albeit this relationship is rather deeper, going back to their time together as players at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nMauricio Pochettino said he made Reece James Chelsea captain because of \u2018his personality, his leadership, the respect he has from the club\u2019. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nThere is a reason why Pochettino calls Arteta \u201cfamily\u201d. They joined PSG at the same time, early 2001; Pochettino was 28, Arteta 18. They hit it off immediately, Pochettino wowed by Arteta\u2019s charisma and his reading of the game. \u201cAlready, he was a coach,\u201d Pochettino said, and he has no qualms with what some perceive as Arteta\u2019s histrionic touchline behaviour.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am 51 and still sometimes I feel that decisions are no good or unfair. You are competitive. Like with Mikel or myself or other coaches that played football, in our minds, we still believe we can play. Still, we have the animal instinct. We cannot be thinkers.\u201d\n\nFor Pochettino, it must be about channeling the emotion in the right way and not suppressing it. More broadly, he is in a better place after the wins at Fulham and Burnley, which followed the Carabao Cup victory over Brighton on the day that James was charged.\n\nArsenal represent an acid test of the progress and the start of a daunting run in the league; after them, Chelsea face Brentford, Tottenham, Manchester City, Newcastle, Brighton and Manchester United. Pochettino, though, pushed back against the notion that he was seeking a first statement win at the club, something to ignite his tenure. All he wants are points to drive his team up from 11th in the table.\n\nPochettino has appeared mired in a selection crisis since his arrival at Chelsea; James only one element of it and he will be without seven others through injury against Arsenal.\n\n\u201cThe moment we have all the squad at a high level and fit, we can say: \u2018OK, we are going to Arsenal, Manchester City and we are going to beat you.\u2019 At the moment, with the circumstances, I don\u2019t think this game is going to be a statement to say: \u2018Be careful, Chelsea is coming,\u2019 or something like this.\u201d"

Really, really inspirational. He was really supportive. I was living with him for 2-3 months so that period was key in my career to be able to make it.\n\n\"He's an expert at giving you confidence and then keeping you on your toes all the time and being really harsh on me every time I was doing something: 'Where have you been last night?!' He really looked after me.\n\n\"The way he understood the game was phenomenal. I used to have him at my back and he was constantly coaching me. Very proud of what he has done and the way he has done it throughout his coaching career.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for what he did for me and the way he guided me in those early years. He got something else out of me that was needed in that period to make it and stayed with me in my football career as a player and coach.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Stunning goals, touchline clashes, and incorrect red cards!

    "body": "The world can ill-afford another full-fledged war, when economies are already battling high inflation and interest rates, an ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and now, a slowing China. This is precisely why many countries are trying to restrict any escalation in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The non-escaltion of the current hostilities seems to be the base case presumed by the Indian stock market presently, going by the market movement in the last week.\n\nThe US treasury secretary also stated that the current conflict is not likely to significantly impact global economic outlook. History too shows that the these conflicts tend to have limited impact on markets. We studied the history of conflicts between Israel and Hamas, and found that these tend to have limited impact on global financial markets, across crude oil, US 10-year yields, US equities and market volatility (see charts).\n\nHowever, as far as trade goes, there may be some impact. In 2022-23, Israel\u2019s share in exports from India stood at 1.87 per cent. India shipped goods around $8billion to Israel. Petroleum products account for 65 per cent of the exports, followed by gems and jewellery (15 per cent) and electrical machinery (3 per cent). Trade can be adversely impacted if operations at the Israeli ports are disrupted. Fertiliser movement from Israel\u2019s Port of Ashdod accounts for 3 per cent of global potash supply. Any disruption on this front will also be a dampener.\n\nBut, what if the current hostilities turn into a full-scale conflict?\n\nWhat supports this proposition is the fact that while there have been many conflicts between Israel and Hamas in the past decades, there have been none of this intensity. With at least 1,200 Israelis killed, this has been the biggest single-day killing of Jews since Holocaust, and Israel opposition is also united in retaliating. Israel has termed it a \u2018War\u2019, formed a war management cabinet with a key opposition member, and vowed to change the look of the \u2018Middle East\u2019.\n\nA massive strike by Israel in Gaza, potentially killing civilians in collateral damage, may attract more of the Middle East countries, including the de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to raise serious issues against Israel on humanitarian grounds. It will surely slow down the deal between Saudi and Israel that the US was facilitating. Besides Gaza, clashes have already been ongoing along Israel\u2019s borders with Syria and Lebanon. If Iran gets dragged into the conflict, on account of claims of funding Hamas, this could embroil the entire Middle East in crisis.\n\nIn this scenario, we see a major upward pressure on world inflation, on account of disruption in crude oil and world trade logistics.\n\nPossible disruption in crude and trade logistics\n\nEven before the Hamas attack, Saudi Arabia and Russia further cut oil production, in an already tight supply market. Iran is a big incremental supplier of oil, contributing 3 per cent to the global supply and any escalation risks taking energy prices higher. For security reasons, Israel has already told Chevron to shut down its offshore energy platform.\n\nThe Middle East crisis brings back memories of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, when OPEC cut oil to supporters of Israel. It used to account for 50 per cent of the oil production back then. Although non-OPEC production has picked up and OPEC contribution is lower at 32 per cent, it is still sizeable to take oil prices higher. A 10 per cent rise in crude price will result in global inflation being 0.4 percentage points higher next year.\n\nThe war may also impact Suez Canal trade, which is a key maritime route between Asia and Europe and accounts for 12 per cent of global trade by value and much larger by volume; also 5 per cent of world oil trade.\n\nAs things stand today, trade may not yet be impacted through the Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Oman and Iran. But a spread of the crisis to the whole Middle East can risk trade through this route, which accounts for 20 per cent of global oil trade passage. If Iran is embroiled into this conflict, then trade with landlocked Central Asia, which is a big agricultural producer, raw materials and minerals like copper, cotton, uranium, gold, natural gas, gets disrupted. Central Asia also hosts a network of road, rail, and air routes that link China, Europe, and South Asia.\n\nImpact on Indian markets\n\nIn the above scenario, supply disruption will lead to higher inflation and central bankers will have to adjust their policies and hold rates higher for longer than anticipated. We may witness a scenario where rates are held higher till the year 2025. Higher crude oil bill and higher global rates will prompt the RBI to also remain hawkish in its approach with regards to rates and liquidity measures. EBITDA margins of India Inc. may again get impacted on account of higher input costs and higher freight and fuel costs.\n\nRural India is a key engine that is not firing at the moment. Valuations also are rich and do not offer margin of safety in the near to medium term. Near-term attractiveness of equities will reduce, as investors will demand a higher risk premium. The Indian stock market will likely correct materially, as FIIs look to withdraw funds from risk assets and seek safe havens in US Dollar, US treasuries offering high yields and Gold.\n\nSectors which will be negatively impacted include Petrochemicals, Oil Marketing, Paints, Packaging, Textiles and Chemicals.\n\nThe writer is Group President & Head - Institutional Equities, YES Securities India\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

    "body": "Housing market pessimists have been sounding the alarm for years about a pending crash in the U.S. residential real estate market. Even before the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to fight inflation last year, pushing mortgage rates to a 23-year high this month, years of surging home prices left some experts warning that the housing market was a massive bubble ready to pop.\n\nHowever, despite a widely bearish outlook in the industry, most real estate veterans have avoided arguing that home prices will drop like they did during the 2008 crash that kicked off the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). And so far, that\u2019s been a wise decision.\n\nIt took until June 2022 for national home prices to peak, even as mortgage rates soared and purchase applications plummeted amid the Fed\u2019s first interest rate hikes. And while prices fell more than 5% from that peak by January of this year, they returned to a record high in July.\n\nStill, a Bank of America team led by U.S. economist Jeseo Park warned this week that there\u2019s more \u201cturbulence\u201d coming for the housing market due to high mortgage rates. They explained that they\u2019re getting an eerie feeling of \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d but it\u2019s not 2008 that is coming to mind, it\u2019s the 1980s.\n\n\u201cLooking back at previous housing recessions, we think the 1980s are a better analogy for today\u2019s market than the 2008 housing crash,\u201d they wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nThis isn\u2019t 2008\n\nWhile the housing crash of 2008\u2014fueled by the collapse of subprime mortgages\u2014haunts the memories of many Americans, the real estate market of that era was very different from what Bank of America\u2019s experts see today.\n\nPark and her team noted that there are no \u201cnoticeable signs\u201d of excess housing development today like there were back then, and households aren\u2019t nearly as burdened by mortgage debt. Household mortgage debt represented roughly 65% of U.S. consumers\u2019 disposable income in the second quarter, compared to 100% before the GFC. And the ratio of Americans\u2019 mortgage debt to their real estate assets\u2014also called loan-to-value\u2014was just 27% in the second quarter, compared to over 40% in 2008 and roughly 50% in 2010, Bank of America\u2019s data shows.\n\nNew legislation was also enacted since the GFC to help prevent worst-case scenarios in the housing market. One of the most obvious effects of these new laws is that there are far fewer risky adjustable-rate mortgages today. Adjustable-rate mortgages can lead to higher default rates when interest rates rise, but they now represent less than 5% of total purchase and refinance loans, compared with over 35% at the peak of the pre-GFC housing cycle.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate that we do not expect another housing crash like 2008,\u201d Park and her team concluded after presenting this evidence.\n\nIs it a repeat of the \u2018turbulence\u2019 of the 1980s?\n\nAccording to Bank of America, today\u2019s housing market looks a lot more like the early 1980s than it does 2008. Back then, just like today, home prices had boomed for years before Fed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest rates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation.\n\nThe rise in the consumer price index peaked at around 14% in 1980 before then\u2013Fed Chair Paul Volcker\u2019s hawkish policies sent mortgage rates to 18% in a year\u2019s time, cooling inflation, but sparking a recession. This caused a serious downturn in the housing market in which home sales and building levels cratered. However, national home prices actually remained stable.\n\nAt the start of Volcker\u2019s term as Fed chair in August 1979, the median U.S. home sales price was $64,700. And even after a near doubling of mortgage rates, that figure rose to $69,400 by the second quarter of 1981.\n\nOver the past 18 months, the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell, has been following a very similar game plan to Volcker\u2019s, raising interest rates aggressively to quash inflation. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the most common type of mortgage in the U.S., has soared from 3.8% in March 2022 to over 7.5% today as a result. This, in turn, has slowed mortgage purchase applications and caused home sales to plummet, just as it did in the \u201980s; but home prices, echoing the dynamic of that era, have yet to collapse.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the resilience of the housing market in both of these periods is demographics. \u201cNoticeably, demographics were favorable back then, with baby boomers having entered the prime homebuying age,\u201d Park and her team wrote Thursday, arguing millennials are in a similar position today. \u201cSome sales activity should be supported by millennials reaching the prime homebuying age, and single-family building permits have steadily held up. This can help the housing market retain some of its momentum without falling apart.\u201d\n\nBank of America economists believe that low inventory of existing homes for sale combined with solid home sales to millennials could help put a \u201cfloor beneath home prices,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some near-term pain due to higher mortgage rates.\n\n\u201cWith rates likely staying higher for longer, we are cautious of potential turbulence ahead,\u201d the group warned. Bank of America has previously forecast 0% home price growth and falling home sales for the full year 2023, but it didn\u2019t offer a new prediction in its latest note.\n\nEventually, as inflation fades leading the Fed to cut interest rates, housing affordability will improve. \u201cAt that stage, we should see a more stable and healthy housing market,\u201d Park and her team wrote. \u201cUntil then, hang tight, it may be a bumpy ride.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to correct a mistaken term used to refer to Jeseo Park. We regret the error."

    "body": "Week 11 of the 2023 NFL season has provided plenty of drama, from the Bears hanging with the Lions to the Giants getting a rebound from emergency quarterback Tommy DeVito. But the latest round of regular-season action has also brought another wave of unfortunate injuries. Here's a roundup of the latest big names to go down around the league:\n\nQB\n\nC.J. Stroud (Texans) left for a single play against the Cardinals after absorbing a hard hit, with backup Davis Mills entering in relief. Stroud did not receive an injury designation, however, and returned after a quick check-in from trainers.\n\nGeno Smith (Seahawks) suffered an injury to his throwing arm after guiding a 16-7 lead over the Rams, showing frustration while trying to stretch the arm after a hit from Aaron Donald. Seattle quickly ruled him questionable to return with an elbow issue, and backup Drew Lock took over under center with 18 seconds left in the third quarter. Smith did return, however, for the final drive of the game in the losing effort. Head coach Pete Carroll said that Smith will \"make it back.\" When asked if that means for Thursday's matchup against San Francisco, the coach said, \"I would think so.\"\n\nSam Howell (Commanders) received medical attention on the sidelines after enduring several hard hits to the upper body on a touchdown run against the Giants. He was quickly cleared of a potential concussion, however, and remained in the game. Veteran journeyman Jacoby Brissett is Washington's backup.\n\nRB\n\nAaron Jones (Packers) suited up against the Chargers despite a lingering hamstring issue, only to manage just five carries before suffering a knee injury. The former Pro Bowler needed help to leave the field and was then carted to the locker room, replaced by A.J. Dillon. Green Bay ruled him questionable to return, then downgraded him to out, but coach Matt LaFleur said after the Packers' win over Los Angeles that he doesn't expect the injury to be a long-term issue.\n\nDe'Von Achane (Dolphins) returned from injured reserve -- and a four-game absence -- but limped to the sidelines after his second touch of the first quarter against the Raiders. Miami ruled him questionable to return with a knee injury, and while he later returned to the sidelines from a locker-room visit, he was replaced on the field indefinitely by Raheem Mostert. Head coach Mike McDaniel told reporters on Monday that Achane is day-to-day. While he hasn't been ruled out of Friday's matchup with the Jets, he's not been given the green light either, so his status is worth monitoring.\n\nKenneth Walker III (Seahawks) took four carries against the Rams before leaving with an oblique injury. He was seen walking on the sidelines shortly afterward but ruled doubtful to return. Rookie Zach Charbonnet, who entered Week 11 with just over 200 rushing yards on the year, replaced Walker as Seattle's top ball carrier. Following the game, Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll told reporters Walker suffered an \"oblique strain that was legit\" and could miss time.\n\nD'Onta Foreman (Bears) remained a headliner of Chicago's backfield against the Lions, even with Khalil Herbert back from injured reserve, but managed just 14 yards on the ground before suffering an ankle injury. He walked off with a limp and attempted to run on the sidelines but did not return to the field after the Bears ruled him questionable.\n\nPick Six Newsletter Crafted By The Best NFL Experts Get the day's big stories + fun stuff you love like mock drafts, picks and power rankings.

Hill has left multiple games this year, only to return in all of them.\n\nCooper Kupp (Rams) had just a single catch against the Seahawks before suffering an ankle injury while blocking. The former All-Pro, who battled a lingering hamstring injury earlier this year, received attention on the sidelines after limping off, then left the game for further evaluation in the locker room. He was ruled questionable to return. NFL Media reported on Monday that Kupp suffered a low ankle sprain and will be evaluated going forward.\n\nDarius Slayton (Giants) had a big impact against the Commanders, hauling in a deep score from Tommy DeVito, before exiting with an arm injury. He was ruled out for the remainder of the contest halfway through the third quarter.\n\nEDGE\n\nJoey Bosa (Chargers) appeared to injure his right leg or foot while held in a block during a first-quarter pass-rushing attempt against the Packers. He limped to the sidelines and was carted to the locker room, then ruled questionable to return.\n\nDB\n\nTalanoa Hufanga (49ers), who emerged as a ballhawk for San Francisco's secondary in 2022, left early against the Buccaneers with a knee injury. Coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters on Monday that the All-Pro suffered a season-ending ACL tear."

    "body": "In the final weeks of the fantasy football regular season, rolling out a strong receiver corps comprised of wideouts set up for high usage days is every fantasy owner's goal. Having those WRs in plus matchups makes it even more likely you'll end the week in the win column. Our Week 13 fantasy WR PPR rankings can help pinpoint all the studs and sleepers at fantasy's deepest position.\n\nThere aren't as many studs or sleepers this week, as six byes and some inopportune injuries thin out our rankings. Nonetheless, we still have to fill out the same number of starting spots in our lineups, so those in 12-team leagues might have to dig deep to find decent WR3s and flexes. That's where we come in.\n\nNow that we know the backdrop to this pivotal week, let's break down our Week 13 WR rankings.\n\nMORE: Watch NFL RedZone live with Sling (50% off first month)\n\nWhich WRs are on bye in Week 13?\n\nWith the Ravens, Bills, Vikings, Raiders, Giants, and Bears idle in Week 13, that means Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs, Justin Jefferson, DJ Moore, Zay Flowers, Jakobi Meyers, and Jordan Addison are among the most notable wideouts omitted from our rankings. Deep-league owners will also be without Odell Beckham Jr., K.J. Osborn, Gabe Davis, Jalin Hyatt, and Khalil Shakir.\n\nWEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nUnfortunately, we also won't get to pick on the poor WR defenses of the Giants and Vikings, but it's a relief to see the Ravens' shut-down secondary on the sidelines.\n\nWEEK 13 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWho are the best fantasy WRs in Week 13?\n\nTyreek Hill (@ Commanders in Week 13) did his thing despite a tough matchup in Week 12, resulting in Miami's WR1 returning to the top spot against a putrid Washington stop unit. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Seahawks) isn't far behind, as Dallas' WR1 aims to maintain his efficient play against Seattle.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown (@ Saints) has been a target hog the past several weeks, seeing at least nine looks in each of his past six games. Don't expect his workload to decrease in a bounce-back game for the Lions. Keenan Allen (@ Patriots) looks to continue his dominant ways, as Justin Herbert's go-to target routinely has double-digit target potential.\n\nMike Evans (vs. Panthers) sits in our top five for Week 13, totaling four TDs over the past three weeks. A.J. Brown (vs. 49ers) faces a sound San Francisco coverage unit in Sunday's NFC Championship rematch, but his ability to dominate in the red zone still makes him a top-10 PPR play. Ja'Marr Chase (@ Jaguars) averaged over 20 yards per reception in Week 12, and although the drop-off from Joe Burrow to Jake Browning is massive, Chase still has WR1 upside given his usage.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. (@ Texans) faces a Texans' pass defense that's been shredded the past few weeks, so another 100-yard receiving day could be in store. Jaylen Waddle (@ Commanders) is also looking to post his second consecutive 100-plus yard day, which could come to fruition against a struggling Commanders' coverage unit. Tank Dell (vs. Broncos) continues to rise up our PPR rankings, rounding out our top 10 as a trusted option of C.J. Stroud's.\n\nWEEK 13 FANTASY ADVICE: Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nWho are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 13?\n\nCurtis Samuel (vs. Dolphins), Jayden Reed (vs. Chiefs), Lynn Bowden Jr. (vs. Lions), Jonathan Mingo (@ Buccaneers), Cedric Tillman (@ Rams), and DeVante Parker (vs. Chargers) profile as this week's crop of sleepers and waiver-wire adds.\n\nSamuel saw a heavy dosage of targets in Week 12, and with Washington passing at a high clip, another high-usage day could be in store. Reed's scored in three straight games and while he has a higher ceiling in standard formats, he still has flex appeal in a potentially negative game script.\n\nBowden Jr., alongside A.T. Perry and Keith Kirkwood, are the only healthy Saints WRs right now, and a favorable matchup against Detroit gives each some flex value in deep leagues. Mingo also draws a plus matchup against a reeling Buccaneers secondary, as a potential negative game script should boost his Week 13 fantasy ceiling.\n\nTillman is another talented rookie who's getting more run as the season progresses, and although P.J. Walker's struggled under center, Tillman is set up for a high-usage day against the Rams with Amari Cooper (ribs) banged up.\n\nWEEK 13 DFS:\n\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks | Best values\n\nWho are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 13?\n\nBeware of Terry McLaurin (vs. Dolphins), Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell (vs. Browns), Drake London (@ Jets), and Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (@ Cowboys) this week.\n\nMcLaurin's averaging just 42 receiving yards over his past three games, and a heavy dosage of Jalen Ramsey hinders his Week 13 fantasy value.\n\nNacua and Atwell see a Cleveland coverage unit who entered Week 12 allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to WRs. Heck, even Cooper Kupp, who hasn't looked like himself of late, could underperform again.\n\nWe can't trust London and the rest of the Falcons passing offense against a well-rounded Jets defense. To make matters worse, he'll be matched up against Sauce Gardner for most of the day, too.\n\nLockett and Smith-Njigba might be better suited for the bench in PPR leagues against a lockdown Dallas coverage unit. Geno Smith's struggles complicate their fantasy prospects, as well.\n\nWhat are the biggest WR injuries in Week 13?\n\nEntering Week 12, Tee Higgins (hamstring), Noah Brown (knee), Treylon Burks (concussion), and Kadarius Toney (ankle, hip) all failed to suit up due to nagging injuries. For now, we've placed Higgins and Brown in our Week 13 list and omitted Burks and Toney. We'll also be eyeing the Chargers' Josh Palmer (knee), who's eligible to come off the IR this week but probably won't suit up against New England.\n\nLast week, the most notable WRs to exit their respective games with injuries include Chris Olave (concussion), Amari Cooper (ribs), Demario Douglas (concussion), and Rashid Shaheed (thigh). We've left all four WRs out of our initial Week 13 list but will closely monitor their teams' injury reports to gauge their playing prospects.\n\nAs usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.\n\nFantasy WR PPR Rankings Week 13: Who to start, sit at wide receiver\n\nRankings based on PPR scoring formats\n\nRank Player\n\n1 Tyreek Hill, Dolphins @ Commanders\n\n2 CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys vs. Seahawks\n\n3 Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions @ Saints\n\n4 Keenan Allen, Chargers @ Patriots\n\n5 Mike Evans, Buccaneers vs. Panthers\n\n6 A.J.

    "body": "The alligator got my attention. Which, of course, was the point. When you hear that a 10-foot alligator is going to be released at a rooftop bar in South Florida, at a party for the people being accused of ruining the internet, you can\u2019t quite stop yourself from being curious. If it was a link \u2014 \u201cWATCH: 10-foot Gator Prepares to Maul Digital Marketers\u201d \u2014 I would have clicked. But it was an IRL opportunity to meet the professionals who specialize in this kind of gimmick, the people turning online life into what one tech writer recently called a \u201csearch-optimized hellhole.\u201d So I booked a plane ticket to the Sunshine State.\n\nI wanted to understand: what kind of human spends their days exploiting our dumbest impulses for traffic and profit? Who the hell are these people making money off of everyone else\u2019s misery?\n\nAfter all, a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are \u201cabsolutely unusable\u201d; \u201cgarbage\u201d; and \u201ca nightmare\u201d because \u201ca lot of the content doesn\u2019t feel authentic.\u201d Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.\n\nDoing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled \u201cSponsored\u201d above organic search results; it\u2019s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority. The goal is to tell the algorithm whatever it needs to hear for a site to appear as high up as possible in search results, leveraging Google\u2019s supposed objectivity to lure people in and then, usually, show them some kind of advertising. Voil\u00e0: a business model! Over time, SEO techniques have spread and become insidious, such that googling anything can now feel like looking up \u201csneaker\u201d in the dictionary and finding a definition that sounds both incorrect and suspiciously as though it were written by someone promoting Nike (\u201cfootwear that allows you to just do it!\u201d). Perhaps this is why nearly everyone hates SEO and the people who do it for a living: the practice seems to have successfully destroyed the illusion that the internet was ever about anything other than selling stuff.\n\nSo who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something.\n\n\u201cThis is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,\u201d explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he\u2019s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an ego among all of them,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou succeed, and now you\u2019re a genius. Now you\u2019ve outdone Google.\u201d\n\nThe more I thought about search engine optimization and how a bunch of megalomaniacal jerks were degrading our collective sense of reality because they wanted to buy Lamborghinis and prove they could vanquish the almighty algorithm \u2014 which, technically, constitutes many algorithms, but we think of as a single force \u2014 the more I looked forward to going to Florida for this alligator party. Maybe, I thought, I would get to see someone who made millions clogging the internet with bullshit get the ultimate comeuppance. Maybe an SEO professional would get attacked by a gigantic, prehistoric-looking reptile right there in front of me. Maybe I could even repackage such a tragedy into a sensationalized anecdote for a viral article about the people who do SEO for a living, strongly implying that nature was here to punish the bad guy while somehow also assuming the ethical high ground and pretending I hadn\u2019t been hoping this exact thing would happen from the start.\n\nBecause I, too, use Google. I, too, want reliable and relevant things to come up when I look through this vast compendium of human knowledge. And I, too, enjoy the sweet taste of revenge.\n\nThe first thing that went wrong at the alligator party was the alligator was only five and a half feet long, not 10 feet, as advertised. Classic clickbait!\n\nThe second thing that went wrong at the alligator party was that I found almost everyone I met to be sympathetic, or at least nice enough not to want to see them get maimed by a five-and-a-half-foot alligator. My harshest assessment of the 200 digital marketers taking shots and swaying to a dancehall reggae band was that they dressed like they lived in Florida, which almost all of them did.\n\nTake Missy Ward, a blonde in an orange bandage dress so tight she told me she couldn\u2019t take full steps. She laughed as she explained that she\u2019d ordered the dress on Amazon and hadn\u2019t tried it on until the day of the alligator party. Ward had a feisty, wry energy that made me want to root for her. When she started doing SEO in 1998, she said, it was \u201cfive girls and all dudes.\u201d She eventually sold her company for $40 million. Somehow, in the moment, I was psyched to hear this. She was being so patient, explaining the history of SEO and suggesting other people for me to reach out to. I should really go talk with that guy across the room, who had a long-running podcast about SEO, she said, the one in the sky blue polo.\n\nHis name was Daron Babin, and I quickly learned he was just the kind of \u201cmodern-day pirate shit\u201d guy I\u2019d been warned about: thrilled at the opportunity to recount the brilliant trickery that had allowed him to line his pockets. His SEO career got going in 1994, before Google even existed. \u201cThe air of manipulation was insane,\u201d Babin told me. \u201cWe had this weird community of geeks and nerds, and we all talked to each other about how we were beating the algorithms up,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were trying to outrank other people just for bragging rights.\u201d\n\nWe were chatting on a patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, between the buffet and the band, when the host of the alligator party, Darren Blatt, came up to say how glad he was that I\u2019d found Daron Babin.\n\n\u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\n\nDarren and Daron (pronounced the same way) have been friends for decades, since the era when Darren \u201cD-Money\u201d Blatt would throw rap star-studded internet marketing shindigs during the Adult Video News Awards in Vegas, back when sex sites were among the most advanced in technology, and Daron Babin was using SEO to promote offshore casinos and Viagra (\u201cWe were outranking Pfizer!\u201d). Together, Darren and Daron managed to milk all three of the early online cash cows: porn, pills, and gambling.\n\nAs the internet became more regulated and mainstream, around the turn of the century, Darren noticed Daron\u2019s SEO skills were increasingly in demand. \u201cI told him that he was missing the boat, that he needed to be a consultant and charge a few grand,\u201d Darren said.\n\nDaron took the advice, asking for $2,000 a day, and watched his career explode. \u201cI would wake up in a city and not know what time zone I was in,\u201d he recalled. To slow the pace, he upped it to $5,000 a day, but \u201cit seemed the more I raised my rates, the more gigs I was getting.\u201d\n\nNowadays, he mostly invests in cannabis and psychedelics. SEO just got to be too complicated for not enough money, he told me. Ward had told me the same thing, that she had stopped focusing on SEO years ago.\n\nI was considering how it was possible that so many people have been complaining recently about SEO ruining the internet if these people were telling me the SEO business is in decline when I met Jairo Bastilla. He was the kind of tall, charming man who described himself multiple times as \u201ca nerd,\u201d and he pointed out that even though working directly with search engine rankings is \u201cno longer monetizing at the highest payout,\u201d the same \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d remains relevant for everything from native advertising to social media.\n\nTranslation? SEO is now baked into everything. Bastilla, for example, specializes in email campaigns, which he called \u201cdeliverability.\u201d\n\nAs a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living. Why does it always seem to surprise me, even after all these years, that the way we behave on the internet is often quite different from how we act in real life?\n\nI wandered off to wait in line for a drink, where I noticed several people nonchalantly making space in a corner, as if to move out of the way for a bartender carrying empty glasses. There, squirming along the ground, was the alligator himself, wagging his tail, snout held shut by a thin strip of electrical tape. His handler was nowhere in sight. It was an unsettling vision, a predator pretending to be just another party guest.\n\n\u201cThey should untape the mouth!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not even scared.\u201d\n\nAs sunset turned to dusk, I found Daron Babin again, and he started telling me about one of his signature moves, back in the \u201990s, involving fake domain names: \u201cI could make it look like it was somebody else, but it actually redirected to me!\u201d What he and his competitors did was legal but well beyond what the dominant search engine allowed. He never faced any consequences, but in the end, internet users at large felt the effects: \u201cIt muddied up Yahoo, ultimately,\u201d he said, \u201cbut while it worked, we banked.\u201d\n\nThe situation sounded familiar. But I liked Babin. He was funny and smart, a keen observer of the SEO world. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a very weird time, technologically, with AI, from an optimization standpoint,\u201d he told me. Anyone who thought the internet was already saturated with SEO-oriented content should buckle up.\n\n\u201cAll the assholes that are out there paying shitty link-building companies to build shitty articles,\u201d he said, \u201cnow they can go and use the free version of GPT.\u201d Soon, he said, Google results would be even worse, dominated entirely by AI-generated crap designed to please the algorithms, produced and published at volumes far beyond anything humans could create, far beyond anything we\u2019d ever seen before.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna be able to stop the onslaught of it,\u201d he said. Then he laughed and laughed, thinking about how puny and irrelevant Google seemed in comparison to the next generation of automated SEO. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it!\u201d\n\nOnce I was safe at home, my alligator attack bluster having deflated into an irrepressible affection for clever scoundrels, mixed with fear about the future promised by said scoundrels, I decided to seek a broader range of the people who do SEO for a living. Perhaps the ones who live in Florida were simply too, well, Florida, and the ones who live elsewhere might be more principled? An old contact heard I was writing about SEO and suggested I find a man he called Legendary Lars: \u201cHe was an absolute god in that space.\u201d\n\nI tracked down Lars Mapstead in Northern California, where he was preparing to run for president in 2024 as a Libertarian. Mapstead spent the first two years of his life in a Volkswagen van traveling the Pacific coast before his hippie parents settled on a Big Sur property with goats, chickens, and no electricity. He became a tinkerer and an autodidact, the guy who reads the instruction manual and fixes everything himself. When he first heard about the World Wide Web, it was 1993, and he was working for a company selling computer motherboards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the freedom of information!\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s all just about collaborating and bettering mankind!\u201d\n\nHe learned how to build a website and then how to submit a site to be listed in early search directories like AltaVista, WebCrawler, Infoseek, and Lycos. He learned how to create chat rooms, attracting people spread across the globe, all alone in their homes but together online. It was beautiful. It was exciting. Mapstead saw himself as an explorer in a small but finite kingdom. \u201cI had surfed the entire internet. There wasn\u2019t a page I hadn\u2019t seen.\u201d\n\nAnd then, one day, a company in New York offered to pay him $2,000 a month to put banner ads on one of his websites, and everything changed. More clicks meant more ad dollars. Higher search engine rankings meant more clicks. So whatever it took to get a higher ranking, he learned how to do. He bought photographs of women in bikinis and made a 60-page slideshow with banner ads on each page. He realized that most search engines were just listing websites in order of how many times a search term appeared on the site and in its tags, so he focused on stuffing his sites with keywords, resubmitting his URL to the search engines, and waiting for the results to change.\n\nMapstead started pulling in $25,000\u2013$30,000 a month, working 12- to 14-hour days. \u201cIt was how long could I stay awake and how little life could I have because this was more money than I could have ever imagined in my lifetime,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\n\nAround this time, in 1997, an Italian professor published a journal article about what he called Search Engines Persuasion. \u201cFinding the right information on the World Wide Web is becoming a fundamental problem,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA vast number of new companies was born just to make customer Web pages as visible as possible,\u201d which \u201chas led to a bad performance degradation of search engines.\u201d\n\nEnter Google. The company revolutionized search by evaluating websites based on links from other websites, seeing each link as a vote of relevance and trustworthiness. The founders pledged to be a neutral navigation system with no ads: just a clean white screen with a search box that would bring people off of the Google landing page and out to a helpful website as seamlessly as possible. Users quickly decided this link-based sorting methodology was superior to the existing search engines, and by the end of 1999, Google was handling the majority of online queries.\n\n\u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month.\u201d\n\nMapstead, like many of the early practitioners of SEO, figured out how to adapt. Almost as soon as Google took over, a secondary market emerged for links. For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links from blog networks built entirely for that purpose. It was easy: buy links that led to your site and watch your ranking in Google\u2019s results rise.\n\nI came to understand that, since the dawn of the internet, there have been people attempting to manipulate search and then people decrying those manipulations as the end of search\u2019s ability to be useful. It works in cycles. People doing SEO find loopholes in the algorithm; critics complain about search results; search engines innovate and close the loopholes. Rinse, repeat.\n\nBefore our current moment of widespread disillusionment with online information, the rise of SEO had reached a breaking point multiple times. In 2003, as Google approached the deadline to disclose pertinent business information leading up to its IPO, the company quietly released an update cracking down. By 2011, SEO was once again oppressively pervasive. TechCrunch published a story called \u201cWhy We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google,\u201d which argued that \u201cGoogle has become a jungle: a tropical paradise for spammers and marketers.\u201d In the next year, Google made two major changes to the algorithm, which came to be called Panda and Penguin.\n\nWhile the public might have experienced each of these updates as a relief, Mapstead and his SEO compatriots saw them as devastating. \u201cThey change the rules instantly overnight, and then you\u2019re out of business,\u201d he told me. \u201cHere you\u2019re trying to rely on this business model to feed yourself and your family, and they\u2019re pulling the rug from underneath you, and you\u2019ve gotta scramble to pay rent.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry about Mapstead. This is a guy seemingly blessed with a never-ending mental stream of schemes. He helped start a handful of companies, including the once-ubiquitous hookup site AdultFriendFinder, which sold in 2007 for $500 million. He tried to retire after that but got bored and started a couple of Facebook pages devoted to his passion for hot rods and custom cars. This was during the peak years for social media, and just as Bastilla had described back at the alligator party, Mapstead\u2019s \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d came in handy. Before long, his pages had 25 million followers. \u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd that was supposed to be my hobby!\u201d\n\nAs I spoke with more SEO professionals around the country, I began to think that the reason I found them endearing and not evil was that while many had made quite a bit of money, almost none had amassed significant power. Unlike the Elon Musks and Jeff Bezoses of the world, who went from geeky teenagers to masters of the universe, the dorks who grew up to do SEO have stayed the butt of the joke, beholden to the fluctuations of the algorithm, frantically pulling levers behind the scenes but ultimately somewhat hapless.\n\nI mean, have I even mentioned that they call themselves \u201cSEOs\u201d? Really. They say things like, \u201cAs the SEO, my job is to get more traffic.\u201d This title feels thirsty to be seen as similar to a CEO, to be taken seriously. And compared to the rest of the tech world, SEO has always lacked a certain glamor or a certain messiah complex. Case in point: while many of the tech CEOs claiming to save the world these days live in Miami, the alligator party was an hour up the coast in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\u201cThe SEO people are just trying to make money,\u201d said Peter Kent, the author of several dozen explanatory tech books, including SEO for Dummies and Bitcoin for Dummies. \u201cThe cryptocurrency people are trying to make money, but they\u2019re also trying to overthrow, you know, the existing system.\u201d\n\nKent has done his fair share of SEO jobs but also has something of an outsider\u2019s perspective. For years, he\u2019s been telling people that part of the SEO industry\u2019s reputation problem is that 80 percent of SEOs are scammers.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies and individuals out there selling their services as SEO gurus don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or don\u2019t really give a damn,\u201d he explained. As a consultant, he\u2019s often had businesses ask him to vet the work of other SEOs. \u201cI would take a look at their site and determine the firm had done next to nothing and had been charging thousands a month for years on end.\u201d\n\nWhen I ran this 80 percent scam figure by other SEOs, most agreed it sounded accurate, though people were divided about what to ascribe to greed and what was just stupidity.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t because they have a scammer\u2019s heart,\u201d said Bruce Clay. \u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t have the real expertise.\u201d Clay is an avuncular man with a mustache who is often credited with coining the phrase \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d and is therefore called \u201cthe father of SEO.\u201d He told me his agency never hires an SEO with less than a decade of experience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online.\u201d\n\nThough Google publishes guidelines explaining how to do better in search (\u201cMake your site interesting and useful\u201d), the exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret, meaning that SEO involves a lot of reverse engineering and guesswork. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site\u2019s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on the mien of a premodern farmer, struggling to figure out how to make it rain. Should he do that dance he did last year the night before it poured? Or maybe sacrifice his firstborn?\n\nThe algorithm is just too opaque, too complicated, and too dynamic, making it easy for scammy SEOs to pretend they know what they\u2019re doing and difficult for outsiders to sort the good SEOs from the bad. To make things even more confusing for, say, a small business looking to hire someone to improve their Google ranking, even a talented SEO might need a year of work to make a difference, perhaps implying a good SEO was a scammer when in fact, the client was just being impatient or refusing to implement essential advice. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of effort that\u2019s required to do things to move the needle, and a lot of companies aren\u2019t willing to put out the money for that, even though it may be worthwhile in the long run,\u201d said John Heard, a longtime SEO based in Kansas.\n\nOf course, some people bristled at the very suggestion that the industry is filled with con artists. \u201cThere are a lot of scammers in every single business. It\u2019s just easier to call yourself an SEO than a doctor,\u201d said Barry Schwartz. Schwartz is an unbelievably fast talker and a prolific writer who has spent the past two decades covering SEO for the trade rag Search Engine Land. Both over the phone with me and in his work, he has defended SEO as a legitimate, dignified pursuit: \u201cThe search community is filled with hard-working individuals working to help their clients\u2019 websites succeed in Google Search. That success is not done through dark, corrupt or shady tactics but rather hard, smart and thorough work.\u201d\n\nSeveral people that I spoke to made a similar point: the best SEOs are the ones that follow Google\u2019s rules, which essentially ask you to make amazing websites without even thinking about Google. You are not supposed to make any attempt to artificially boost a website\u2019s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. And many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots and people who get ahead by violating Google\u2019s terms of service, just as the mild-mannered teacher\u2019s pet in a classroom does not negate the obnoxious shouting of the kids that refuse to behave. A few loud kids can easily drown everyone else out.\n\nEven Schwartz acknowledged the effect that the rule-breaking SEOs have had on the internet experience. We get to talking about the types of small businesses that are particularly lucrative customers for SEOs, including lawyers, accountants, and contractors, because these are the professions eager for attention from all the people going online to find local recommendations. If Schwartz himself had to hire a reliable attorney, I asked, what would be the best way to do so?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe you ask a friend.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing so much about what it was like to be an SEO, I decided it was time to better understand what\u2019s been going on from the perspective of the search engine. Google was slow to allow someone to talk with me, possibly because of the giant PR clusterfuck that has been the company\u2019s past year (accused by the federal government of being a monopoly; increasingly despised by the public; losing ground to Reddit, TikTok, and large language models), so I decided to start by meeting up with a chipper, charismatic man named Duane Forrester.\n\nForrester was at Microsoft from 2007 until 2015, where he helped launch and manage Bing, the perpetual underdog to Google\u2019s domination of online search. Before and after his time at Microsoft, Forrester worked as an SEO, so he sees the industry from both sides, like an aerospace engineer who spent a few years at the Department of Defense, left for the private sector, and now is much better at winning military contracts. Forrester has a holistic understanding of the delicate push and pull between the SEOs desperate for clues on how to do their jobs better and the search engine trying to keep its secret-sauce algorithm proprietary. He also knows a huge range of people in the industry. Like Schwartz, he wanted to emphasize how hard everyone works. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many people I know who built companies and sold them and have just, like, made wealth,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is not a 40-hour commitment in the week. That is a 400-hour commitment.\u201d (For the record, there are 168 hours in a week.)\n\nThese days, Forrester lives in Los Angeles, and he asked me to meet him at one of his favorite restaurants, which felt like a British pub operated by Disney World, tucked away in a desert strip mall. Inside, every inch was covered in Anglophile paraphernalia, including Union Jack flags, a mural of Big Ben, and a red phone booth. Over a full English breakfast, he told me about growing up in rural Canada, where his parents owned a motel. As a kid, he used to mess around with the pay phone outside, eventually figuring out how to finagle free long-distance phone calls. \u201cAnd then it became, \u2018What else can I know how to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the \u201990s, Forrester was trading tips with other SEOs in online forums. He still remembers the thrill of the very first SEO conference he went to, where he was asked to speak. \u201cThe people who got up onstage to talk were seen as somehow more knowledgeable, but I don\u2019t know that we felt that way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all kind of knew you were making shit up.\u201d\n\nAfter years of being friends online, the SEOs were eager to let loose in person, giving off what Forrester described as \u201cthat vibe of a lot of young people with access to a lot of money. And it was like, no expenses spared in New York City.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d\n\nFor Forrester, it was the start of a long career of keynote presentations and consummate schmoozing \u2014 Clay, the father of SEO, described him to me as \u201ca cruise director\u201d on the SS SEO. The conference circuit has treated Forrester well. He\u2019s attended events in Napa, Hawaii, and Barbados, among many others, as well as \u201can infinite number of private dinners and these types of things in every city you can think of, at the most lavish restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many Michelin-starred meals I\u2019ve had, \u2019cause it\u2019s now in the dozens, from my time in this industry. And I\u2019m not going to say no to the dinner that everyone\u2019s going to, that one company is sponsoring because it\u2019s a thank you to everybody who contributed to, whatever it was, you know? And you go and everybody has a good time. You talk about the industry, and that\u2019s it. And it becomes the stuff of legends.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he\u2019s seen it all. He remembered \u201cwalking into hotel rooms and it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning, there\u2019s drugs and alcohol and everything everywhere, and there\u2019s a party going on.\u201d Forrester marveled at the audacity of his fellow SEOs. \u201cSomebody showed up and brought her Aston Martin to a conference and parked it at the front door. Immediately got a parking ticket.\u201d He suggested she might want to relocate the car before it got towed, but the woman told him she would just move it to the next parking spot and get another ticket. \u201cShe goes, \u2018It\u2019s cheaper for me to leave the car parked out front and use it as a way to start conversations with potential clients than it is for me to rent a suite at the hotel and get people to go to the suite to have the same conversation.\u2019\u201d Then, she offered to take Forrester for a joyride around Seattle. Obviously, he said yes.\n\nOnce he represented Bing, Forrester more or less stopped drinking at conferences, as had long been the case for his counterpart at Google, an engineer named Matt Cutts, who helped build and then ran the company\u2019s web spam team before stepping back in 2014 and leaving in 2016.\n\nCutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. When we spoke on the phone, he told me that before he left, he determined that he had sent about 50,000 emails to people outside of Google during his decade and a half at the company.\n\nSeveral SEOs described trying to get Cutts to drink at conferences so he would \u201cspill secrets,\u201d as one put it, but what generally ended up happening was that all the SEOs would get drunk instead. Meanwhile, Cutts would stay sober, jotting down the latest SEO methods on a small notepad, sitting quietly in the corner at the bar.\n\n\u201cMy favorite question to ask an SEO,\u201d Cutts told me, was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d which prompted responses that felt like \u201ca cross between showing off and a confessional.\u201d So many SEOs were tempted to reveal the vulnerabilities they\u2019d discovered in Google\u2019s algorithms, even when they were talking to the one person they really shouldn\u2019t have been talking to, the guy who was planning to go back to his office and make those vulnerabilities disappear.\n\nAs a former SEO himself, Forrester understood that the quality of Bing\u2019s search results would be impacted by the work of SEOs, so it made sense to communicate with SEOs as much as possible. Cutts similarly tried to serve as a conduit between SEOs and Google, but Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude he described as: \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this, and you know what? We\u2019ll just kind of ignore you, and when you give us feedback, eh, we don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\nCutts, as an individual, seemed to be doing his best within an expanding corporate behemoth to remain approachable. \u201cOne thing I learned early on was that even when someone was shouting at you, there\u2019s a kernel of something you needed to hear in the other person and listen to and respect and integrate and incorporate,\u201d he told me. Most SEOs told me they appreciated his efforts. When Google released the 2011 Panda update that devastated a generation of SEO businesses, Cutts openly recognized the impossible task of achieving the kind of epistemological neutrality that Google\u2019s founders had initially promised, telling Wired at the time, \u201c[T]he only way to be neutral is either to randomize the links or to do it alphabetically.\u201d\n\nStill, some blamed him personally for \u201ckilling\u201d companies that had relied on the previous iteration of the algorithm. During his time at Google, Cutts regularly received death threats and hate mail. When SEOs would send, say, a fruit plate or a brownie cake addressed to him at Google\u2019s offices, he told me, \u201cWe\u2019d take it down to the kitchen with a note warning: possibly poisoned.\u201d\n\nAfter Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people, none of whom could quite fill his shoes: \u201cThose personalities sometimes were standoffish,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cSome of them were superior. Some of them were a bit too wallflower.\u201d\n\nOne of the people Google brought in was Danny Sullivan, a former journalist who started Search Engine Land, the industry publication where Schwartz works, back in the 2000s. In 2009, Sullivan was described as \u201cthe closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,\u201d so when he published \u201cA deep look at Google\u2019s biggest-ever search quality crisis\u201d in 2017 and then took a job as Google\u2019s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist.\n\n\u201cThere is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn\u2019t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d he went on, but compared to Cutts, \u201cI think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.\u201d\n\nWas all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it.\n\nWhen I finally manage to jump through the flaming rings necessary to be allowed to speak on the phone with Sullivan, albeit with a communications chaperone also on the line, I find him angry and defensive. He\u2019s annoyed that anyone would think his era at Google has been less transparent than Cutts\u2019 was: \u201cWe have reams of help documents!\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have more people assigned to work with SEOs than we did when Matt worked here!\u201d\n\nSullivan is mad that the public and the media don\u2019t really understand what he considers to be basic precepts about how search works, leading him to adopt a rather scolding tone online. He\u2019s frustrated that people want to know every last detail about Google\u2019s algorithm because even \u201cif we listed all one thousand of the ranking signals\u201d and how much each was worth, he said, that wouldn\u2019t actually help SEOs do their jobs better, anyway.\n\nAnd most of all, Sullivan is pissed that people think Google results have gone downhill. Because they haven\u2019t, he insisted. If anything, search results have gotten a lot better over time. Anyone who thought search quality was worse needed to take a hard look in the mirror.\n\n\u201cWe have an entire generation that grew up expecting the search box to do the work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might do a better job of matching for a bulk of people, but for people who are super sensitive, when they have that fail moment, now it becomes, \u2018All my searches aren\u2019t good.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe problem was not Google. The problem was not SEOs. The problem was kids these days.\n\nOf course Sullivan would say this, though. He works for Google. I felt like I began to understand why many SEOs had told me that Cutts\u2019 departure had marked a major turning point in the history of the internet, emblematic of Google\u2019s transition from idealistic startup to one of the most valuable and powerful companies to ever exist. Over the phone, Cutts came off as humble and thoughtful, acknowledging the nuances and challenges of the search engine business, while Sullivan sounded like an impatient corporate stooge, trying to gaslight me into believing the sky was red.\n\nBut here\u2019s the part where I started to feel the way I\u2019ve felt so often in recent years, like I was losing my grip on reality: Sullivan was not the only person who tried to tell me that search results have improved significantly. Out of the dozen-plus SEOs that I spoke with at length, nearly every single one insisted that search results are way better than they used to be. And except for Sullivan, these were not people with an incentive to praise Google. If anything, these were folks who lamented how much harder it had become for them to take advantage of Google. Today, they told me, search results are just objectively more accurate. More useful. More difficult to manipulate.\n\nThis was not what I had been noticing, and this was certainly not what I had been hearing from friends and journalists and friends who are journalists. Were all of us wrong? Or engulfed in some kind of Baader\u2013Meinhof frequency bias delusion? Had I been researching a nonexistent problem? Were Google results actually amazing? Truly, I had lost the plot. Was the premise of this piece completely off? Was I the asshole who deserved to be attacked by an alligator?\n\nI began to worry all the people who were mad about search results were upset about something that had nothing to do with metrics and everything to do with feelings and ~vibes~ and a universal, non-Google-specific resentment and rage about how the internet has made our lives so much worse in so many ways, dividing us and deceiving us and provoking us and making us sadder and lonelier. Decades of American optimism about the wonderful potential of technology, from the Moon landing to personal computers to the iPhone, had finally, in the last few years, broken down into comprehensive chagrin at the petty, pathetic, and violent world enabled by our devices. Was all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. To muddy it up, as Babin had put it, but while it worked, to make as much fucking money as possible.\n\nThe person who helped me snap out of my confusion spiral was an SEO named Lily Ray. Ray is a 30-something jet-setter with black-line tattoos and an asymmetrical, dyed blonde pixie cut. I managed to catch her for lunch in Brooklyn between speaking gigs in Chicago and Berlin on a day when she was also simultaneously managing a 35-person team at her digital marketing agency, posting multiple times an hour on social media, dog-sitting for a Pomeranian whose \u201cdaddies\u201d were at Burning Man, caring for her own mini Australian shepherd, and organizing the house party she was hosting that weekend \u2014 a party she expected to be late for because she first had to drop by a rooftop to perform a DJ set at a different party.\n\nRay reassured me that I was not crazy. Google results today do feel different from how they felt just five or six years ago for two major reasons. The first was Google\u2019s response to the disinformation panic around the 2016 election, which involved questioning the notion that the most reliable information could be chosen by a form of popularity, meaning how many links a site received from other sites. As a result, the algorithm seemed to change its approach to links, especially when it came to news and sites offering legal, financial, or health advice, and instead paid more attention to what Google came to call E-E-A-T: experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\n\n\u201cE-E-A-T has had a pretty big impact on what types of results you see,\u201d Ray told me. She\u2019s done extensive (and fascinating) research around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what\u2019s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately affecting right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has described heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start. Now, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority.\n\nYou can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at\n\nThis felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.\n\nThe second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO \u2014 specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.\n\n\u201cSEO that goes against Google\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s not new,\u201d Ray explained. A decade ago, it used to be called \u201cblack hat\u201d SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved \u201cwhite hat\u201d tactics. And Google has, as Sullivan and many SEOs told me, gotten better over time at catching SEOs playing tricks on the algorithm. Although many of us may have rosy memories of how magical and cool Google seemed in the early days, most SEOs consider the years between 2003 and 2011 to be the boom times, when you could still get a fake corporate website listed above the real corporate website, and you could mess with the search results for a major political figure such that something sexual or racist would come up first.\n\nGoogle is harder to game now \u2014 it\u2019s true. But the sheer volume of SEO bait being produced is so massive and so complex that Google is overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s exponentially worse,\u201d Ray said. \u201cPeople can mass auto-generate content with AI and other tools,\u201d she went on, and \u201cin many cases, Google\u2019s algorithms take a minute to catch onto it.\u201d\n\nThe future that Babin had cackled about at the alligator party was already here. We humans and our pedestrian questions were getting caught up in a war of robots fighting robots, of Google\u2019s algorithms trying to find and stop the AI-enabled sites programmed by SEOs from infecting our internet experience.\n\nEventually, a site filled with computer-generated nonsense designed to maximize SEO will get removed from search results, Ray explained, but while it\u2019s up, the creator might make as much as $50,000 or $100,000 a month. A lot of the people who did this, she said, live cheaply overseas in places like Bali and Chiang Mai. \u201dThey make a bunch of money, that site dies, and they go do it again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a churn and burn strategy. So if people are seeing those results, it can be very frustrating for users \u2018cause it\u2019s like, \u2018This is terrible.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd yet, as much as she despises what this kind of SEO has done to the internet, Ray told me she hesitated to condemn the actual people doing it. \u201cI used to do those types of tactics, so I couldn\u2019t hate on anybody personally,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people have a problem with Google\u2019s results, they have to ask themselves, is it the fault of the SEOs?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is this Google behaving differently than it used to?\u201d\n\nSullivan had tried to convince me that Google was not behaving differently and, in fact, had not changed its search criteria in any major way for the past 20 years. Google wanted you to make good websites, and that was that. Everyone who tried to rank higher by messing with the algorithm would be blocked. Sullivan even insisted that what these rule-breakers did should not be called SEO: he deemed it all \u201cspam.\u201d What is spam? \u201cSpam is stuff that search engines don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nBut the line between strategies that violate Google\u2019s terms of service and strategies that don\u2019t has always been blurry and inconsistently enforced. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this much tension in the industry in terms of, like, what Google says to do and what people are doing and getting away with,\u201d Ray told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna tell us that this stuff doesn\u2019t work, make it stop working!\u201d\n\nRay seemed like the most reasonable person I had spoken to so far. Sure, she called herself a \u201cthought leader,\u201d and yes, sure, she had changed her last name to improve her personal branding by more closely associating herself with her grandmother\u2019s uncle, the artist Man Ray. Maybe some people would say that\u2019s the kind of absurd behavior that merits being attacked by an alligator, but I was beginning to come down on the side of the SEOs, who seemed to have a lot less agency than I\u2019d first imagined.\n\nGoogle had started with a noble cause: trying to make the internet easier to navigate at scale. The company did accomplish that goal, but in doing so, it inadvertently and profoundly changed how the internet looked. The problem lay in Google trying to be an objective and neutral arbiter of an information landscape that was meant to pretend it did not exist. You cannot design a free, automated system to help people find information without some people trying to game that system. You can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at.\n\nFor the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google\u2019s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities. As Google\u2019s founders wrote back in 1997: \u201cwe expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business\u2019s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library. Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge. Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.\n\n\u201cThere were so many true believers at Google in the early days,\u201d Cutts told me. \u201cAs companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.\u201d He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, \u201cI deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.\u201d He speculated that the company didn\u2019t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness \u201cencourages regulators and makes people realize, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a lot of money here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can\u2019t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it.\n\nAnd as much as I might hate the way the SEOs who don\u2019t follow Google\u2019s rules have altered my online experience, the reality is that most people running a company will break whatever rules they are able to get away with breaking. While Ray herself said she has left behind the guideline-violating tactics of her past, choosing instead to do as Google asks and make high-quality websites that will \u201cmake the internet a better place,\u201d as she put it, that kind of moral standard can be a lot to ask of someone running a business.\n\n\u201cThey want this wholesome thing, and I can understand that. That\u2019d be neat,\u201d said an SEO named Cade Lee. \u201cBut that\u2019s maybe in a world where we don\u2019t have money and greed and things, you know?\u201d\n\nLee was the person I spoke with on the phone before going to the alligator party, the guy who warned me that SEO was \u201cmodern-day pirate shit.\u201d He is among the SEOs who have spoken publicly, on panels, about violating Google\u2019s guidelines. He\u2019s also an ex-con who used to trade penny stocks and served time for securities fraud. His entire body is covered in tattoos, from his scalp to his legs to his fingers. When we met up for beers in Denver at a bar outside an escape room, he told me that his probation officer in the economic crime offenders unit has never tried to stop him from violating Google\u2019s terms of service.\n\n\u201cI was transparent about it, and they approved it,\u201d he said. They even approved \u201csome pretty questionable things, like in regards to adult sites,\u201d he told me, specifically involving what he\u2019d thought were ads for consensual sex workers. Later, an activist reached out and showed him how certain websites he had built were supporting human trafficking. Horrified, he shut the whole thing down, even then helping the activist with her website.\n\nThese days, Lee runs a construction company. His probation officer hates when he phrases it like this, but he thinks any way you make money is essentially a con or a scam of some kind. \u201cThe good con is like, you actually delivered, and you came through and made a profit.\u201d For example: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take that old lady\u2019s money to build her a brand new patio. There\u2019s that scam, and then there\u2019s, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s take her deposit and run.\u2019\u201d Lee is the kind of guy who has spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world: what matters, what doesn\u2019t, and how his actions affect other people. He was in the Marines, he sold mortgages in the lead-up to the 2008 crash, he went to prison, he\u2019s done SEO. He understands that he needs to make money to survive, but he\u2019d like to do so in a way that is minimally harmful. So he prefers the good kind of con.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with SEO for me \u2014 it was becoming bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cI was not feeling good about customer meetings and about what I was saying, and I was like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019\u201d"

    "body": "Hey, folks, and welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s newsletter covering the past week (or so) in tech industry happenings. This week marked OpenAI\u2019s first-ever dev conference, where the Microsoft-backed AI startup announced a host of new products. But that was far from the only item of note.\n\nIn this edition of WiR, we spotlight Brian\u2019s review of the 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Air and M3 iMac 24-inch; Mozilla betting on a decentralized social networking future; Ford shuttering a company that was building an app for plumbers, electricians and other trades; and Tim Cook\u2019s thoughts on generative AI. Also on the agenda is WeWork officially filing for bankruptcy, Bumble getting a new CEO, and the spectacular failure of EV startup Arrival.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to get through, as always \u2014 so we won\u2019t delay. But first, a reminder to sign up here to receive WiR in your inbox every Saturday if you haven\u2019t already done so.\n\nMost read\n\nOpenAI throws a dev day: OpenAI hosted its first-ever developer conference on Monday, and the company had a lot to talk about. Some of the more notable items announced were tools to create custom \u201cGPTs\u201d (i.e., domain-specific chatbots), new text-to-speech models, an API for the text-to-image model DALL-E 3, and an improved version of OpenAI\u2019s flagship model, GPT-4, called GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nMac attack: Brian reviewed Apple\u2019s new 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro and the M3 iMac 24-inch. He found the iMac to be lacking and not necessarily worth the upgrade from the 2021 model, excepting the M3 chip, which brings \u201cimpressive\u201d performance gains over the already-powerful M1.

The idea, O\u2019Hara said, is to rethink social networking from the ground up.\n\nFord shutters SaaS app for field work: Ford has shut down VIIZR, a software-as-a-service company that, along with Salesforce, built an app to help tradespeople like plumbers, locksmiths and electricians to schedule field appointments, send invoices and manage customers, Kirsten reports.

    "body": "OpenAI is expanding its internal safety processes to fend off the threat of harmful AI. A new \u201csafety advisory group\u201d will sit above the technical teams and make recommendations to leadership, and the board has been granted veto power \u2014 of course, whether it will actually use it is another question entirely.\n\nNormally the ins and outs of policies like these don\u2019t necessitate coverage, as in practice they amount to a lot of closed-door meetings with obscure functions and responsibility flows that outsiders will seldom be privy to. Though that\u2019s likely also true in this case, the recent leadership fracas and evolving AI risk discussion warrant taking a look at how the world\u2019s leading AI development company is approaching safety considerations.\n\nIn a new document and blog post, OpenAI discusses their updated \u201cPreparedness Framework,\u201d which one imagines got a bit of a retool after November\u2019s shake-up that removed the board\u2019s two most \u201cdecelerationist\u201d members: Ilya Sutskever (still at the company in a somewhat changed role) and Helen Toner (totally gone).\n\nThe main purpose of the update appears to be to show a clear path for identifying, analyzing, and deciding what do to about \u201ccatastrophic\u201d risks inherent to models they are developing. As they define it:\n\nBy catastrophic risk, we mean any risk which could result in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic damage or lead to the severe harm or death of many individuals \u2014 this includes, but is not limited to, existential risk.\n\n(Existential risk is the \u201crise of the machines\u201d type stuff.)\n\nIn-production models are governed by a \u201csafety systems\u201d team; this is for, say, systematic abuses of ChatGPT that can be mitigated with API restrictions or tuning. Frontier models in development get the \u201cpreparedness\u201d team, which tries to identify and quantify risks before the model is released. And then there\u2019s the \u201csuperalignment\u201d team, which is working on theoretical guide rails for \u201csuperintelligent\u201d models, which we may or may not be anywhere near.\n\nThe first two categories, being real and not fictional, have a relatively easy-to-understand rubric. Their teams rate each model on four risk categories: cybersecurity, \u201cpersuasion\u201d (e.g., disinfo), model autonomy (i.e., acting on its own), and CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; e.g., the ability to create novel pathogens).\n\nVarious mitigations are assumed: For instance, a reasonable reticence to describe the process of making napalm or pipe bombs. After taking into account known mitigations, if a model is still evaluated as having a \u201chigh\u201d risk, it cannot be deployed, and if a model has any \u201ccritical\u201d risks, it will not be developed further.\n\nThese risk levels are actually documented in the framework, in case you were wondering if they are to be left to the discretion of some engineer or product manager.\n\nFor example, in the cybersecurity section, which is the most practical of them, it is a \u201cmedium\u201d risk to \u201cincrease the productivity of operators . . . on key cyber operation tasks\u201d by a certain factor. A high-risk model, on the other hand, would \u201cidentify and develop proofs-of-concept for high-value exploits against hardened targets without human intervention.\u201d Critical is \u201cmodel can devise and execute end-to-end novel strategies for cyberattacks against hardened targets given only a high level desired goal.\u201d Obviously we don\u2019t want that out there (though it would sell for quite a sum).\n\nI\u2019ve asked OpenAI for more information on how these categories are defined and refined \u2014 for instance, if a new risk like photorealistic fake video of people goes under \u201cpersuasion\u201d or a new category \u2014 and will update this post if I hear back.\n\nSo, only medium and high risks are to be tolerated one way or another. But the people making those models aren\u2019t necessarily the best ones to evaluate them and make recommendations. For that reason, OpenAI is making a \u201ccross-functional Safety Advisory Group\u201d that will sit on top of the technical side, reviewing the boffins\u2019 reports and making recommendations inclusive of a higher vantage. Hopefully (they say) this will uncover some \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201d though by their nature those are fairly difficult to catch.\n\nThe process requires these recommendations to be sent simultaneously to the board and leadership, which we understand to mean CEO Sam Altman and CTO Mira Murati, plus their lieutenants. Leadership will make the decision on whether to ship it or fridge it, but the board will be able to reverse those decisions.\n\nThis will hopefully short-circuit anything like what was rumored to have happened before the big drama, a high-risk product or process getting greenlit without the board\u2019s awareness or approval. Of course, the result of said drama was the sidelining of two of the more critical voices and the appointment of some money-minded guys (Bret Taylor and Larry Summers), who are sharp but not AI experts by a long shot.\n\nIf a panel of experts makes a recommendation, and the CEO makes decisions based on that information, will this friendly board really feel empowered to contradict them and hit the brakes? And if they do, will we hear about it? Transparency is not really addressed outside a promise that OpenAI will solicit audits from independent third parties.\n\nSay a model is developed that warrants a \u201ccritical\u201d risk category. OpenAI hasn\u2019t been shy about tooting its horn about this kind of thing in the past \u2014 talking about how wildly powerful their models are, to the point where they decline to release them, is great advertising. But do we have any kind of guarantee this will happen, if the risks are so real and OpenAI is so concerned about them? Maybe it\u2019s a bad idea. But either way it isn\u2019t really mentioned."

    "body": "While the offseason has gotten rolling, trade season hasn\u2019t quite arrived. The Tigers acquired Mark Canha from Milwaukee in the biggest swap of the first couple weeks. Otherwise, the GM Meetings simply served to set the stage for future transactions.\n\nThat\u2019ll surely involve some notable trades. Unlike the summer deadline, projecting which players will change hands is difficult at this stage of the offseason.\n\nAside from the A\u2019s, there aren\u2019t any teams clearly in rebuild mode. Clubs like the Rockies, Royals, White Sox, Nationals and Angels have uphill paths to contention, yet none has indicated they\u2019re prepared to punt on the 2024 season entirely.\n\nThe Padres, Twins, Rays, Brewers and Guardians are all aiming to contend but have questions about their payroll. That\u2019s standard operating procedure for Tampa Bay, Milwaukee and Cleveland. San Diego and, to a lesser extent, Minnesota have shown a willingness to spend in recent years but are scaling back \u2014 in both cases, likely tied to their uncertain local television rights contracts.\n\nThat informs the offseason trade landscape, which is headlined by a few stars deep into their arbitration windows. Without many clear rebuilders, it\u2019s possible we see more swaps of big leaguers at positions of need between teams that expect to compete.\n\nBefore we get to the list, a note on methodology. This isn\u2019t a strict ranking of players\u2019 trade value, nor is it solely about likelihood of being moved. We\u2019re trying to balance both of those things, an inherently subjective exercise.\n\nAll projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players are courtesy of MLBTR contributor Matt Swartz.\n\n1. Juan Soto, LF, Padres\n\nOther than Shohei Ohtani\u2019s free agency, there may be no bigger story of the offseason than Soto\u2019s future in San Diego. He is entering his final year of club control, projected for a $33M salary that would be the highest ever for an arbitration-eligible player.\n\nThe Padres are scaling back payroll, perhaps as much as $50M. They need multiple starting pitchers and could stand to upgrade at first base and/or designated hitter.\n\nTrading Soto would allow the Friars to recoup MLB-ready talent while clearing significant spending room for multiple smaller additions. It would also be a devastating blow to the lineup. Soto overcame a relatively slow start (by his standards) to hit .275/.410/.519 with 35 home runs this year.\n\nThe Padres are still motivated to win in the short term. Barring what would be a stunning run at Ohtani, they\u2019re not going to acquire anyone better than Soto.\n\nPresident of baseball operations A.J. Preller continues to maintain they\u2019ll explore a long-term deal. There\u2019s nothing to suggest an extension is particularly likely. Soto rejected a $440M offer from the Nationals before he was traded at the 2022 deadline. The price would only be higher now that he\u2019s a year and a half closer to free agency.\n\nIn the absence of an extension or a definitive declaration that Soto is off the trade market, speculation will linger. Alden Gonz\u00e1lez of ESPN wrote last week that many throughout the industry believe the three-time All-Star will be available.\n\n2. Corbin Burnes, SP, Brewers\n\n3. Willy Adames, SS, Brewers\n\nBurnes and Adames are tied together with good reason. They\u2019re each one year from the open market and projected for a noteworthy arbitration salary \u2014 $15.1M for Burnes, $12.4M for Adames. Milwaukee is reportedly open to offers on the majority of the roster.\n\nA former Cy Young winner, Burnes may be the best pitcher available in trade. The right-hander posted a sub-3.00 ERA each season from 2020-22. His 3.39 mark across 193 2/3 innings this past season wasn\u2019t quite so dominant but is still high-end production.\n\nBurnes struck out just under 26% of opposing hitters. While his lowest mark since his rookie season, that\u2019s still an above-average figure.\n\nAdames is coming off a less impressive year. The 28-year-old hit .217/.310/.407 through 638 trips to the plate. That\u2019s slightly below-average offense, although he still connected on 24 home runs.\n\nAdames is an excellent defensive shortstop with plus power in an offseason where there are essentially no free agent shortstops of note. Even with a mediocre on-base percentage, he\u2019d generate plenty of interest.\n\n4. Shane Bieber, SP, Guardians\n\nDevelop high-end starting pitching, trade a top starter as they become more expensive, replace him with talented younger arms. The Guardians have trodden this path with Corey Kluber, Mike Clevinger and Carlos Carrasco. Bieber, one year from free agency with a projected $12.2M salary, could be next.\n\nCleveland has the likes of Tanner Bibee, Gavin Williams, Logan Allen, Triston McKenzie and Cal Quantrill (himself a potential trade candidate) as rotation options. While Bieber is no longer a Cy Young caliber pitcher, he turned in a 3.80 ERA with a below-average but serviceable 20.1% strikeout rate over 21 starts this past season.\n\nBieber lost a good chunk of the second half to elbow inflammation but returned to make two appearances in late September.\n\n5. Tyler Glasnow, SP, Rays\n\nThe Rays signed Glasnow to an extension in August 2022 when he was completing his rehab from Tommy John surgery. The big right-hander is set to make $25M next season, the largest single-year salary in franchise history.\n\nThat naturally leads to questions about whether the Rays are prepared to meet that figure, particularly in an offseason where they have a loaded arbitration class.\n\nIf they made him available \u2014 and he\u2019s already surfaced in rumors \u2014 Glasnow would be a very appealing target. He was quite good this year, working to a 3.53 ERA while striking out more than a third of opponents over 21 starts. An oblique strain cost him the first two months of the season, but he avoided the injured list thereafter.\n\nHe\u2019s a year away from free agency, making another extension with Tampa Bay appear unlikely. Yet dealing him would represent a tough blow to the Rays\u2019 chances of competing in 2024. They\u2019re already down Shane McClanahan for the entire season and will be without Jeffrey Springs and Drew Rasmussen for at least a good portion of the year.\n\nWhile they\u2019d likely bring back some kind of MLB help as part of a Glasnow trade return, the rotation depth could be a problem.\n\n6. Dylan Cease, SP, White Sox\n\nCease had a disappointing follow-up to his Cy Young runner-up campaign. He allowed a 4.58 ERA over 177 innings this past season. That\u2019s nearly two and a half runs higher than his sparkling 2.20 mark of the prior year. As is often the case, his true talent probably lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nCease still missed plenty of bats \u2014 27.3% strikeout rate, 13.6% swinging strike percentage \u2014 while issuing a few more walks than ideal. His fastball averaged 95.6 mph, down a tick from the preceding season.\n\nThe right-hander has shown the ability to pitch at an ace-caliber level. He is two seasons from free agency and projected for an $8.8M arbitration salary, making him more affordable than the other high-end starting pitchers near the top of this list.\n\nThe extra year of control probably gives him more trade value than any of Burnes, Bieber or Glasnow. It also makes him less likely to be traded this offseason.\n\nFirst-year GM Chris Getz has suggested no one on the roster is truly untouchable, an understandable approach for a team that just lost 101 games. Neither owner Jerry Reinsdorf nor Getz has called this a rebuild, though.\n\nAny slim hopes the White Sox may have of competing in 2024 would be dashed by trading Cease, the only above-average starting pitcher on the roster.\n\n7. Alex Verdugo, RF, Red Sox\n\nVerdugo\u2019s name has been floated in trade rumors for a few seasons. The Red Sox have held onto him thus far. They have a new baseball operations leader in Craig Breslow, who has acknowledged the team has gotten early calls on the left-handed hitting outfielder.\n\nJarren Duran and Masataka Yoshida also hit from the left side. Dealing Verdugo could free some at-bats for a right-handed addition while perhaps bringing in immediate help for the pitching staff or at second base.\n\nMLBTR projects Verdugo for a $9.2M salary in his final season of arbitration. He\u2019s coming off another league-average offensive showing, when he hit .264/.324/.421 with 13 home runs through 602 plate appearances.\n\nVerdugo hasn\u2019t become the All-Star player the Sox envisioned when building the Mookie Betts return around him. He\u2019s a solid regular, a high-contact hitter who rates as a decent defender in right field.\n\n8. Trent Grisham, CF, Padres\n\n9. Ha-Seong Kim, 2B, Padres\n\nIf the Padres hold Soto, dealing Grisham and/or Kim could be an alternative means of trimming payroll. While neither is going to make anywhere near Soto money in 2024, they\u2019re each on mid-level salaries of note.\n\nGrisham is projected for a $4.9M salary in his second-to-last season of arbitration. Kim is slated for an $8M salary and will be due a $2M buyout on a 2025 mutual option at season\u2019s end. He\u2019ll be a free agent next winter.\n\nGrisham has the extra year of control but is the worse player. He draws plenty of walks but has hit below the Mendoza line in two straight seasons. He\u2019s coming off a .198/.315/.352 line over 555 plate appearances. The appeal is on the other side of the ball.\n\nGrisham is an above-average defensive center fielder, keeping him as a low-end regular even if he\u2019s best suited for the bottom of a lineup. San Diego could kick Fernando Tatis Jr. over to center field if they dealt Grisham, freeing right field for a bigger offensive threat than Grisham provides.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story with Kim. Dealing him would free Jake Cronenworth to move back to second base, opening first base for a better hitter. It\u2019d be tough to replace Kim\u2019s overall production, though. He\u2019s a plus defender at multiple infield spots.\n\nHe hit .260/.351/.398 with 17 home runs and stole 38 bases in 152 games. Trading Kim isn\u2019t as damaging to the lineup as a Soto deal would be, but it\u2019d be tougher than parting with Grisham.\n\n10. Gleyber Torres, 2B, Yankees\n\nAnother player one year from free agency, Torres is projected for a $15.3M salary in his last arbitration season. That\u2019s below his market value but a notable figure for a bat-first second baseman \u2014 a general profile that the league has devalued in recent years.\n\nTorres was New York\u2019s second-best offensive player in 2023, hitting .273/.347/.453 with 25 homers through 672 trips to the plate.\n\nEven if they\u2019re not interested in an extension, New York could hold Torres for his final season of club control. They\u2019re already light on consistent hitting beyond Aaron Judge. On the surface, trading their second-best hitter seems counterintuitive.\n\nThe big question is whether the front office believes Oswald Peraza is capable of stepping into an everyday second base role in 2024. If they feel the 23-year-old is ready, trading Torres to clear spending room while bringing back outfield or pitching help makes sense.\n\n11. Jonathan India, 2B, Reds\n\nThe Reds\u2019 infield surplus has fueled trade speculation on India back to the deadline. Cincinnati didn\u2019t seem inclined to make that move midseason, pointing to India\u2019s role as a clubhouse leader. While that\u2019s certainly still a factor, he didn\u2019t hit well down the stretch and finished the year with a middling .244/.338/.407 batting line. He\u2019s a well below-average keystone defender.\n\nThere\u2019s an argument the Reds are better off relying on an up-the-middle tandem of Matt McLain and either Noelvi Marte or Elly De La Cruz. Perhaps the offseason is a better time to consider moving India for a back-end starter.\n\nThe former Rookie of the Year is projected for a $3.7M salary and has three seasons of remaining arbitration control.\n\n12. Eloy Jim\u00e9nez, DH, White Sox\n\nJim\u00e9nez no longer looks like a core piece for the White Sox. Various injuries have kept him off the field throughout his big league tenure. He only has two seasons of 100+ games and hasn\u2019t gotten to 500 plate appearances since his 2019 rookie year.\n\nJim\u00e9nez was still an excellent hitter when healthy as recently as 2022, when he ran a .295/.358/.500 line over 84 games. His production fell this year, as he posted a .272/.317/.441 slash with 18 homers over 489 trips to the dish.\n\nThat\u2019s not especially imposing for a player who\u2019s best suited at DH. Yet Jim\u00e9nez has shown greater offensive upside that isn\u2019t matched by many in this winter\u2019s free agent class. If the Sox are prepared to move on, another team could look to buy low.\n\nHe\u2019ll make a $13M salary next year, the final guaranteed season of his contract. He\u2019s guaranteed a $3M buyout on a $16.5M club option for 2025 and the deal contains an $18.5M team option for the \u201926 campaign.\n\n13. Max Kepler, RF, Twins\n\n14. Jorge Polanco , 2B, Twins\n\nMinnesota president of baseball operations Derek Falvey has confirmed the team is paring back payroll. The Athletic\u2019s Dan Hayes reported the organization could end in the $125M-140M range. At the moment, they have around $120M in projected spending.\n\nThe Twins have a few ways to clear room. Trading either Kepler or Polanco would accomplish that. The former is making $10M, while the latter is playing on a $10.5M deal. Kepler will be a free agent after next season; Polanco\u2019s contract has a $12.5M team option for 2025 that comes with a $750K buyout.\n\nThey\u2019re each good players. Kepler is a plus defender in right field who hit .260/.332/.484 with 24 homers this year. Polanco was limited to 80 games but ran a .255/.335/.454 showing. He\u2019s one of the sport\u2019s better offensive second basemen and saw some third base action for Minnesota late in the year.\n\nThe Twins have Matt Wallner and Trevor Larnach as left-handed hitting corner outfield options. They\u2019re deeper on the infield, where Willi Castro and Kyle Farmer (another trade candidate) are possibilities at second/third base behind starters Edouard Julien and Royce Lewis.\n\nTop prospect Brooks Lee, the No. 8 overall pick in 2022, isn\u2019t far from MLB readiness. The Twins could look to move Kepler or Polanco for rotation depth or to bring in a righty bat to balance the lineup.\n\n15. Randy Arozarena, LF, Rays\n\nArozarena hasn\u2019t been the subject of the same level of trade speculation as Glasnow has. There\u2019s an argument the Rays should be more willing to move the All-Star outfielder if they\u2019re looking to create payroll room.\n\nTampa Bay has greater depth in the outfield than they do on their injury-riddled pitching staff. Josh Lowe, Jose Siri, Harold Ram\u00edrez, Luke Raley and Manuel Margot are all on hand. (Margot has come up in trade rumors as well.)\n\nNone of those players is as good as Arozarena. Trading star players for younger talent is familiar territory for the Tampa Bay front office though. Arozarena is projected for a $9M arbitration salary and controllable for three seasons. He\u2019d have significant trade value if the Rays were to consider moving him.\n\n16. Mariners SP\n\nWe initially had Bryan Woo in this spot. It could just as easily have been Bryce Miller or Emerson Hancock, so we\u2019ll cheat and just mention the Seattle rotation in general.\n\nThey\u2019re almost certainly not going to trade George Kirby. It\u2019d take a lot to pry away Logan Gilbert. Moving any of Woo, Miller or Hancock could be more appealing for a front office that is looking for ways to add long-term offensive upside.\n\nNone of that trio has even reached one year of major league service. Hancock only has three big league starts under his belt. Miller and Woo spent more time in the rotation this year, starting 25 and 18 games respectively. They both turned in mid-rotation results.\n\nOther clubs probably have differing opinions on which right-hander they prefer. (The Mariners likely have their own slight preferences.) They\u2019d all have significant value if president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto decided to move one for a bat.\n\n17. Dylan Carlson, CF, Cardinals\n\nIt was a bit of a surprise that Carlson didn\u2019t change hands over the summer. Various reports suggested the Cards were making him available as they looked for ways to add a controllable starter. It didn\u2019t happen, but the same logic applies this winter.\n\nCarlson has been surpassed by Lars Nootbaar as the starting center fielder. St. Louis needs multiple starting pitchers and will likely bring in at least one via trade. Carlson probably has less value than he did before the deadline. Not only did he finish with a mediocre .219/.318/.333 batting line, he underwent season-ending surgery on his left ankle in September.\n\nThere\u2019d nevertheless be teams willing to take a shot on a former top prospect who looked like an average or better center fielder 12 months ago. Carlson is projected for a modest $1.8M salary and has three years of arbitration control.\n\n18. Paul Blackburn, SP, A\u2019s\n\nBlackburn is arguably the most desirable realistic trade candidate on the Oakland roster. The A\u2019s have torn things to the studs. They\u2019re unlikely to compete within the two remaining years of Blackburn\u2019s arbitration window. The right-hander (30 next month) worked to a 4.43 ERA with a decent 22.4% strikeout rate over 103 2/3 innings this past season.\n\nHe\u2019s projected for a $3.2M salary. A Blackburn trade isn\u2019t going to be an offseason defining move, but he has a good chance to be flipped to a contender seeking affordable back-end starting pitching.\n\n19. Alek Manoah, SP, Blue Jays\n\nPerhaps no player had a more disappointing 2023 performance than Manoah. Within one season, he went from Cy Young finalist to essentially unplayable. The right-hander pitched to a 5.87 ERA over 19 big league outings. His walks more than doubled while his strikeouts fell from 22.9% to a modest 19% clip.\n\nHe lost his spot in the Toronto rotation and was eventually demoted to the minors. Manoah never pitched in Triple-A and received an injection in his throwing shoulder at the end of the season.\n\nHow will the Jays proceed after that disastrous year? General manager Ross Atkins said last week the team would give him \u201ca strong leg up\u201d on the No. 5 spot in the rotation. The Jays aren\u2019t broadcasting a desire to trade him, although they wouldn\u2019t be doing themselves any favors if they declared they were ready to move on.\n\nDealing Manoah to bring in a lower upside but higher floor pitcher wouldn\u2019t be a surprise with the Jays firmly in win-now mode. The former first-round pick is controllable for four more seasons and won\u2019t reach arbitration until next winter.\n\n20. Brandon Drury, 2B, Angels\n\nThe Halos signed Drury to a two-year free agent deal last winter. The righty-hitting infielder turned in a nice season, connecting on 26 home runs with a .262/.306/.497 line across 523 plate appearances. Next year\u2019s $8.5M salary looks like strong value, particularly in an offseason where the supply of up-the-middle players is thin.\n\nThe Angels probably aren\u2019t kicking off a rebuild. They could do a shorter-term retool if Ohtani walks, or they could simply look to move Drury for pitching while turning second base to Luis Rengifo and/or an external acquisition.\n\n21. Brendan Donovan, 2B, Cardinals\n\nDonovan is a longer shot trade possibility if the Cards move a controllable hitter for starting pitching. He\u2019s more valuable than Carlson and less likely to be on the move.\n\nAt the same time, he\u2019d net a clearer rotation upgrade if St. Louis were to give him up \u2014 likely turning the middle infield over to a combination of Tommy Edman, Nolan Gorman and Masyn Winn in that scenario.\n\nThe 26-year-old hit .284/.365/.422 with 11 homers through 371 plate appearances this past season. A flexor tendon injury pushed him to designated hitter and eventually required surgery that ended his year a couple months early. He\u2019s expected back for spring training.\n\nIf healthy, Donovan brings excellent contact skills and a solid plate approach. He\u2019s a multi-positional defender who can play any of the corners in addition to second base. Donovan has four years of remaining control and won\u2019t get to arbitration until next offseason.\n\n22. Christopher Morel, DH, Cubs\n\nMorel is likely to be a divisive player around the league. He has huge raw power and connected on 26 home runs while slugging .508 in 107 games for the Cubs. The right-handed hitter owns a .241/.311/.471 line in just over 850 MLB plate appearances over the past two seasons. When he\u2019s hot, he can carry a lineup.\n\nHe also strikes out more than 30% of the time and doesn\u2019t have a defensive fit. Morel has played all three outfield spots and each of second base, third base and shortstop in the majors. He hasn\u2019t rated well anywhere.\n\nThe Cubs used him mostly at designated hitter this year and have suggested they\u2019ll get him first base run in 2024. That\u2019s not a great fit for a plus runner with top-of-the-scale arm strength, yet Morel hasn\u2019t shown himself capable of handling more important positions on a regular basis.\n\nHow teams project Morel defensively could impact both whether he\u2019s traded and what kind of return the Cubs could receive. As a first baseman or DH, he\u2019s a fringe regular with a statistical profile that\u2019d paint him as a lumbering slugger as opposed to a dynamic athlete. If another team feels he can hold his own at second base or in center field, he becomes far more desirable.\n\nThe Cubs have no urgency to trade him. Morel is controllable through 2028 and won\u2019t reach arbitration for at least another season. Yet president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer has alluded to the possibility of a deal, saying last week that \u201canother team might be able to put him [at second base],\u201d where the Cubs have Nico Hoerner.\n\n23. Christian V\u00e1zquez, C, Twins\n\nTrading V\u00e1zquez is another route Minnesota could consider to clear money. The Twins signed the veteran catcher to a three-year, $30M free agent deal last offseason. He had a tough first season in Minneapolis, limping to a .223/.280/.318 line over 355 plate appearances \u2014 albeit with his typical brand of excellent defense.\n\nRyan Jeffers easily surpassed him as the No. 1 option on the depth chart. A $10M per year backup catcher is a luxury for a team trying to trim salary.\n\nMinnesota likely wouldn\u2019t be able to offload the entire deal, but they could try to shed around half the money or take on a smaller contract in return.\n\nV\u00e1zquez\u2019s year wasn\u2019t much worse than a season that got Omar Narv\u00e1ez two years and $15M last winter, while Tucker Barnhart secured a two-year, $6.5M guarantee despite a much lesser offensive track record.\n\n24. Luis Robert Jr., CF, White Sox\n\nRobert has the most trade value of any player on this list. He may also be the least likely to move. Last week, Getz called him a franchise building block and noted he had no plans to proactively shop Robert even as he left open the possibility of listening to offers on anyone.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why. Robert\u2019s an elite defensive center fielder who connected on 38 home runs while hitting .264/.315/.542. It was the first time he stayed healthy for a 162-game schedule. The result was a season that\u2019ll get him down-ballot MVP support.\n\nRobert is a prime-aged superstar and, unlike Soto or Burnes, he\u2019s nowhere near free agency. He\u2019ll make $12.5M next year, $15M in 2025 and is controllable via $20M team options for 2026-27. Trading Robert would signify a complete teardown that the Sox probably don\u2019t want. Yet the haul would be astronomical if they decided to go in that direction.\n\n25. Pete Alonso, 1B, Mets\n\nAlonso was the subject of early offseason trade speculation. With the Mets projecting a less active offseason and placing a priority on 2025, it wasn\u2019t out of the question he could be available. Alonso is projected for a $22M arbitration salary and will be a free agent after next year.\n\nNew York has subsequently walked back some of their statements about a possible retool. They\u2019re still aiming to compete in \u201924 even if they\u2019re signaling they won\u2019t blow away the top of the free agent market.\n\nFirst-year president of baseball operations David Stearns has twice publicly said he anticipates Alonso being the Opening Day first baseman in Queens. That won\u2019t stop teams from trying, but an offseason deal looks decidedly unlikely.\n\nOthers of note\n\nA\u2019s: Seth Brown\n\nBraves: Vaughn Grissom\n\nBrewers: Adrian Houser, Devin Williams, Brandon Woodruff\n\nCardinals: Alec Burleson, Tommy Edman, Nolan Gorman, Tyler O\u2019Neill\n\nGiants: J.D.

    "body": "Week 10 in the NFL had some of the league's best teams not playing. But that didn't stop the excitement, with five teams winning on walk-off field goals and more games coming right down to the wire.\n\nWith that, there were some surprising results and expected domination. Some favorites dug deep to win. Some underdogs turned in shocking upsets.\n\nPutting the latest wins and losses into a blender, here's Sporting News' updated look at how all teams stack up against each other, 1-32 going into Week 11:\n\nNFL WEEK 11 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\n\nNFL power rankings Week 11\n\n1. Philadelphia Eagles 8-1 (previous week: 1)\n\nThe Eagles enjoyed a bye trying to get a little healthier for the more difficult stretch run in a top-heavy NFC as they have tough games at the Chiefs (the Super Bowl 57 rematch), vs. the Bills, vs. 49ers and at the Cowboys in the next four. They still look like the conference team to beat as they have proved they still win in many ways around Jalen Hurts.\n\n2. Kansas City Chiefs 7-2 (3)\n\nThe Chiefs had a pretty good week off given they jumped back into the AFC's top seed and home-field advantage spot with the Ravens losing. They already are rolling defensively and expect them to figure out a lot more around Patrick Mahomes after the key Andy Reid bye.\n\n3. Detroit Lions 7-2 (5)\n\nThe Lions are becoming like the Eagles, and that's what makes them the second-best team in the NFC. They can win shootouts with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and their passing game. They also can dominate with the running game. They can win with offense or defense. Dan Campbell is coach of the year.\n\n4. San Francisco 49ers 6-3 (8)\n\nThe 49ers had a surprise offensive get-well game in Jacksonville with Brock Purdy leading the way and all his key supporting weapons doing damage, even without Christian McCaffrey scoring. The biggest development was the defense going back to dominating a good offense.\n\n5. Baltimore Ravens 7-3 (2)\n\nThe Ravens' offense is just fine with the running and passing of Lamar Jackson, but he still can't afford to make big mistakes, which he did vs. the Browns. The defense needs to pick up the pieces, too, stat, ahead of facing the Bengals on a short week.\n\n6. Miami Dolphins 6-3 (6)\n\nThe Dolphins got a much-needed bye to figure out how to beat the better teams in the league. Their defense should be getting a little better to support their often explosive offense. They should feel good about a Week 11 rebound vs. the Raiders.\n\n7. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-3 (9)\n\nThe Steelers are playing the way Mike Tomlin wants, with the running game rolling to big totals with Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris and the defense doing what it needs, more so vs. pass than run, in key moments. You can't argue with the overachieving results.\n\n8. Cleveland Browns 6-3 (10)\n\nThe Browns proved they can win games with defense in another way, with big plays. They also have more offensive pop when Deshaun Watson plays well and the running game doesn't slump. Their playoff hopes look much better after their stunning comeback vs. the Ravens.\n\n9. Jacksonville Jaguars 6-3 (4)\n\nThe Jaguars got an NFC wake-up call against the 49ers, who were much more prepared after a Week 9 bye than they were. Jacksonville needs to forget that debacle and get back on track, stat. The team gets a division double vs. Tennessee and Houston before facing Cincinnati.\n\n10. Dallas Cowboys 6-3 (11)\n\nThe Cowboys took advantage of their \"no contest\" vs. the Giants at home with Dak Prescott continuing to ball as a passer and runner. They need to keep the defense and running game success, too, in bigger games going forward.\n\nMORE: Inside the Cowboys historic offensive explosion vs. Giants\n\n11. Seattle Seahawks 6-3 (13)\n\nThe Seahawks needed every ounce of their offense around Geno Smith to rally to beat the Commanders, but the get-well performance worked well for him, Kenneth Walker and the wide receivers. The defense could be more consistent.\n\n12. Minnesota Vikings 6-4 (14)\n\nThe new man on the Vikings, Josh Dobbs, keeps producing the same results they were enjoying offensively with Kirk Cousins, thanks to more help from the running game for Kevin O'Connell and the defense overall under Brian Flores. Their 0-3 and 1-4 starts are distant memories as the Vikings look for a sixth straight win in Week 11 vs. Denver.\n\n13. Houston Texans 5-4 (16)\n\nThe Texans are looking great with C.J. Stroud leading their offense and now they've found some running game, too. The defense is just making enough plays to put them in position to win high-scoring games. Houston is a legitimate playoff contender under rookie coach DeMeco Ryans.\n\n14. Cincinnati Bengals 5-4 (7)\n\nThe Bengals are battling some key injuries, leaving them much less room for error. Unfortunately, Joe Burrow made key mistakes and the defense wilted against run and pass at home in the loss to the Texans.\n\n15. Buffalo Bills 5-5 (12)\n\nThe Bills fell right into the trap game against the Broncos at home, losing because of more mistakes from Josh Allen. The defense can't tolerate those mistakes with all of its injuries.\n\n16. Las Vegas Raiders 5-5 (22)\n\nThe Raiders are hot, having won two consecutive games for interim coach Antonio Pierce, bringing up flashbacks to the playoff push they made with Rich Bisaccia in 2021. They are right back in the AFC wild-card race with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Vikings ahead.\n\n17. New Orleans Saints 5-5 (15)\n\nThe Saints will go into a bye not knowing what do at quarterback. with Derek Carr further hurting his right shoulder and needed to be checked for a concussion. Jameis Winston did provide a spark, too little too late at Minnesota. But the division lead is precarious with poor QB play overall.\n\n19. Indianapolis Colts 5-5 (19)\n\nThe Colts stopped scoring at least 20 points in every game during their ugly, run-heavy victory in Germany vs. the Patriots. At least Jonathan Taylor is doing his normal things and the defense is playing well again while Gardner Minshew looks meh.\n\n18. Los Angeles Chargers 4-5 (17)\n\nThe Chargers got well offensively with Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler against the Lions. But the defense went back to crumbling vs. big pass plays and added wilting against the run. The pressure is right back on Brandon Staley with a trip to Green Bay next.\n\n20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-5 (23)\n\nBaker Mayfield and the offense is back on track to move the ball well after a brief midseason slump. They're still not lighting it up, but the Bucs are back to playing smart complementary football with their defense rebounding and still might have found a long-term QB answer.\n\n21. New York Jets 4-5 (18)\n\nAaron Rodgers can't come back soon enough, and going for a December miracle might be too late after two straight key losses to the Chargers and Raiders. Zach Wilson will always cap the potential of a talented offense that keeps making mistakes. The Bills and Dolphins in back-to-back division games next might be their season.\n\n22. Denver Broncos 4-5 (24)\n\nThe Broncos got another big win against a AFC power, sandwiching their Week 9 bye with upsets over the Chiefs and Bills. The offense has hit a balanced grooved with Russell Wilson and the defense is making a lot more plays, too.\n\n23. Washington Commanders 4-5 (21)\n\nThe Commanders should be pleased about Sam Howell and the offense showing more fight with additional weapons and the running backs look better all-around again. But the reeling defense and pass protection continue to be un-winnable assets.\n\n24. Atlanta Falcons 4-5 (20)\n\nThe Falcons were forced into another QB change because of injury. They found a few more answers offensively but that position still made it an overall mess. The defense also doesn't seem to be well prepared to different styles of offenses.\n\n25. Green Bay Packers 3-6 (25)\n\nThe Packers saw some improved work from Jordan Love and his young weapons as they spread the ball well in the passing game, but the run defense woes and key holes in coverage have all but doomed their playoff hopes.\n\n26. Los Angeles Rams 3-6 (26)\n\nThe Rams are hoping to find a few more answers during a bye, as Sean McVay has seen his good coaching job earlier in the season go by the wayside with key offensive injuries. They need Matthew Stafford to help save face the rest of the way or the season will look a lot like 2022.\n\n27. Tennessee Titans 3-6 (27)\n\nWill Levis is going through rookie lumps after his dazzling debut as the brutal offensive line woes exacerbated by injuries are getting to him and the entire Titans offense. The Titans still need to keep starting him, because they can't overcome those systemic problems or those in overall pass defense.\n\n28. Chicago Bears 3-7 (29)\n\nThe Bears don't care how they win, but they should be pleased their running game and defense bailed out their limited passing game with Tyson Bagent to secure another win in Week 10. They will hope to finish strong with Justin Fields soon.\n\n29. Arizona Cardinals 2-8 (32)\n\nThe Cardinals got an immediate spark for their offense with Kyler Murray and James Conner back. They also seemed invigorated for Jonathan Gannon on defense and special teams. Look for the Cardinals to finish strong and play a whole lot of spoiler.\n\n30. New England Patriots 2-8 (28)\n\nThe Patriots tried to win a game by hiding Mac Jones and their quarterbacks in general. They almost pulled it off with the running game dominating and short-handed defense making a lot of plays, but they didn't see the results in Germany ahead of a tough bye for Bill Belichick.\n\n31. New York Giants 2-8 (30)\n\nThe Giants can just flush away this season without Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor. The injuries go to their offense early and remained relentless, and now their defense is falling apart, too. The question is, will Brian Daboll get a massive mulligan after his rookie playoff leadership?\n\n32. Carolina Panthers 1-8 (31)\n\nThe Panthers found better defense and special teams to keep them in the game in Chicago, but Bryce Young still can't unlock a limited passing game and the offensive line and running game hasn't help nearly enough."

    "body": "MLB's winter meetings are always a prime time for moves to happen as many of the top executives, players and agents all come together at the same spot.\n\nLast year's winter meetings wound up being explosive. Aaron Judge, Justin Verlander, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts all came away with new contracts.\n\nThis year's winter meetings could wind up being similarly busy. There is a growing sense Shohei Ohtani could sign during the winter meetings, and a move of that magnitude could kick off the next wave of moves. There's also a number of top players on the trade market, including star Padres outfielder Juan Soto.\n\nStarting Sunday, Dec. 3, and running through Wednesday, Dec. 6, expect MLB's offseason to really kick into high gear.\n\nWINTER MEETINGS: Shohei Ohtani rumors, Juan Soto trade destination come to forefront\n\nSporting News will be tracking all the latest news and rumors from the 2023 Winter Meetings. Follow for any signings and trades from Nashville.\n\nMLB Winter Meetings rumors, news, signings\n\nDiamondbacks reportedly land Eduardo Rodriguez\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nThe reigning NL champions have landed one of the free agent market's top pitchers. Left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez has reportedly agreed to a four-year contract with Arizona worth around $20 million per year, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. The deal is still pending a physical, per Passan's report.\n\nA season ago, Rodriguez posted a career-low 3.30 ERA across 152.2 innings with the Tigers, and pitched to a 3.66 FIP. He decided to opt out of his deal with Detroit to test the free-agent market.\n\nJuan Soto reportedly traded to Yankees\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Joel Sherman, New York Post\n\nThe biggest star on the trade market has reportedly been traded. The Padres have reportedly sent Juan Soto to the Yankees in exchange for four pitchers and catcher Kyle Higashioka, according to the New York Post's Joel Sherman. Soto immediately adds to a potent left-handed bat to a lineup sorely in need of some thump from the left side, and provides some much-needed support to 2022 AL MVP Aaron Judge.\n\nMORE: Full Juan Soto trade details\n\nCraig Kimbrel signs with Orioles\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Joel Sherman, New York Post\n\nThe Orioles are bolstering their bullpen, signing Craig Kimbrel to a one-year, $13 million deal, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal. The NY Post's Joel Sherman reported he has a $1 million buyout for 2025 and a $13 million club option. The 35-year-old right-hander amassed 23 saves in 69 innings in 2023 with a 3.26 ERA. He is sitting on 417 career saves, ranking eighth all-time. He has a chance to vault all the way up to fourth, with Francisco Rodriguez (fourth) at 437 and Kenley Jansen (420 saves) the only other active reliever ahead of him.\n\nTrent Grisham likely headed to New York in Soto deal\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Joel Sherman, New York Post\n\nThe Yankees won't just be getting one outfielder from the Padres; it appears they'll be getting two. The NY Post's Joel Sherman reported Trent Grisham would also likely be on the move headed to New York. Grisham enjoyed a pair of breakout seasons to start his career in San Diego and has twice earned Gold Gloves (2020 and 2022), but his offensive production has dwindled, with him batting under .200 in back-to-back seasons.\n\nJuan Soto to Yankees 'close to being finalized'\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nA trade between the Yankees and Padres for Soto is reportedly \"close to being finalized,\" with right handers Michael King and Drew Thorpe expected to highlight the return to San Diego. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported the package will include at least two more players, neither of which will be Alex Verdugo.\n\nOhtani decision expected to be made before end of weekend\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nMLB free agency remains largely on hold as teams wait for Ohtani to sign, and though it had at at point been reported he could sign during the winter meetings, there appears to be a new timeline. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported Ohtani is expected to make his pick before the end of the upcoming weekend. The winter meetings end on Thursday.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto meeting with Yankees, already met with Mets\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network and Will Sammon, The Athletic\n\nThe Yankees could be on the verge of adding Soto, but they might not be done. The Yankees are reportedly going to meet with Yoshinobu Yamamoto in New York, the top pitcher on the market, on Monday. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported New York is considered to be one of the top teams to sign him, along with the Red Sox, Giants, Dodgers and Cubs.\n\nThat will be the second time Yamamoto has met with a New York team. He reportedly already met with Mets owner Steve Cohen in Japan last week.\n\n'Decent chance' Corbin Burnes is traded this winter\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nCorbin Burnes has been named as one of the top trade candidates in the offseason, and it's looking increasingly plausible he might be dealt. NY Post's Jon Heyman reported one rival believes there's \"a decent chance\" Burnes is traded this winter. The 2021 NL Cy Young winner is a free agent after the 2024 season, and could be one of the most expensive pitchers to sign.\n\nMarlins 'listening' to offers on young pitchers\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nMiami made a run to the postseason last year on the strength of its young pitching. And there's a chance the Marlins might now look to part with some of that depth to improve other areas of need. NY Post's Jon Heyman reported Miami is at least believed to be listening to trade packages for its young starters, including Jesus Luzardo, Braxton Garrett and Edward Cabrera, among others.\n\nAlex Verdugo 'expected' to stay with Yankees despite potential Juan Soto trade\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nThe Yankees acquired Alex Verdugo yesterday from the Red Sox. With the team's reported interest in Juan Soto, there was some speculation that Verdugo could be flipped to the Padres, however, MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported that New York is \"expected\" to keep the outfielder rather than include him in a deal with San Diego.\n\nJuan Soto trade to Yankees 'is likely'\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Jack Curry, YES and Brandon Tierney, WFAN\n\nNew York landed Alex Verdugo last night in a deal with the Red Sox. It appears the team could be close to landing the biggest trade acquisition of the offseason. YES' Jack Curry reported the Yankees have \"intensified efforts\" to trade for Soto and that a deal \"is likely.\" He expects New York to deal four or five players.\n\nAdditionally, WFAN's Brandon Tierney reported YES was told by the team to prepare for a 2 p.m. ET emergency \"Hot Stove Show\" and that there is a chance the Yankees complete the deal by lunch.\n\nOrioles 'close to deal' with reliever Craig Kimbrel\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Joel Sherman, New York Post\n\nThe Orioles are said to be \"close\" to a deal with free agent and former Phillies closer Kimbrel, Rosenthal reported Wednesday morning.\n\nBaltimore will be without All-Star closer Felix Bautista for the entire 2024 season after receiving Tommy John surgery in October. Even though stud reliever Yennier Cano emerged as the top candidate to take the job, Kimbrel could bolster the back end of the O's bullpen.\n\nVictor Caratini lands with Astros\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Chandler Rome, The Athletic and Mark Feinsand, MLB.com\n\nVeteran catcher Victor Caratini is headed to Houston on a two-year deal worth $12 million. The 30-year-old will serve as the backup to new starter Yainer Diaz now that Martin Maldonado has moved on.\n\nCaratini filled a similar role in Milwaukee the last two years, slashing .259/.327/.383 with seven home runs in 62 games in 2023.\n\nPirates acquire Marco Gonzales from Braves\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nGonzales, who was acquired by the Braves in the trade that helped them land Jarred Kelenic on Sunday, is being re-routed to Pittsburgh for cash and a player to be named later.\n\nGonzales, 31, is a decent rotation arm with 65 wins, 665 strikeouts and a 4.14 ERA over 893.0 innings pitched in his nine-year career.\n\nYankees land Alex Verdugo from Red Sox\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nFor just the seventh time in the last 50 years (!), the Red Sox and Yankees have agreed to a deal.\n\nBoston will send starting OF Alex Verdugo to New York for RHP Richard Fitts, RHP Greg Weissert and RHP Nicholas Judice.\n\nVerdugo had been the Red Sox's starting outfielder for the last four seasons, coming over as the centerpiece in the trade that sent Mookie Betts to the Dodgers. Verdugo hit .281 with 43 home runs, 206 RBI and 16 stolen bases over 2,071 plate appearances with Boston. He also led the American League in outfield assists in 2020 and 2023.\n\nIn return, Boston will get Weissert and two pitching prospects headlined by Fitts \u2014 the Yankees' No. 4-ranked pitching prospect and 12-ranked prospect overall.\n\nRelievers Yates, Devenski get one-year deals for 2024\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nVeteran relievers Kirby Yates and Chris Devenski know where they'll be pitching in 2024, according to reports Tuesday.\n\nYates, who will be 37 when the season begins, is headed to the Rangers on a one-year deal, per Rosenthal. The right-hander, an All-Star closer for the Padres in 2019, posted a 3.28 ERA in 61 appearances for the Braves in 2023.\n\nDevenski, 33, has agreed to a new one-year deal with the Rays that includes a club option for 2025, according to Passan. Devenski began 2023 with the Angels but was released in late August and signed with Tampa Bay. He posted a 5.08 ERA in 29 games for the Angels and dropped three full runs off that number in nine games with the Rays.\n\nDave Roberts says Dodgers met with Ohtani\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Alden Gonzalez, ESPN\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Tuesday that the team met with Ohtani for 2-3 hours over the weekend. Roberts said Ohtani is \"clearly\" the Dodgers' top priority, adding that the team is confident the two-time MVP will pitch again. Roberts wasn't able to offer a timeline for Ohtani's decision.\n\nPair of pitchers could be signed after Ohtani deal\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nMLB is largely in a holding pattern as it awaits news on Ohtani. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported the Rays could wind up trading Tyler Glasnow shortly after Ohtani signs, listing the Cubs and Reds as top contenders for the ace. He also reported Yoshinobu Yamamoto could sign following Ohtani's deal, and that the Red Sox have him among their top priorities.\n\nCubs losing optimism in signing Ohtani\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Bob Nightengale, USA Today\n\nThe Cubs have been viewed as one of Ohtani's likeliest destinations for a while. It appears that might no longer be the case. USA Today's Bob Nightengale reported one high-ranking executive believes the Cubs' optimism of signing Ohtani \"has now significantly wanted.\" The report stated that leaves the Dodgers, Blue Jays, Angels and Giants as the remaining finalists.\n\nOhtani has 'positive feeling' about Blue Jays\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, The New York Post\n\nThe Blue Jays reported met with Ohtani on Monday, but even before he went to talk with the team, Ohtani reportedly had a \"positive feeling about Toronto,\" along with other cities and teams, including the Dodgers. He has been linked to Toronto and Los Angeles throughout the process.\n\nMariners considering Cody Bellinger\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nFollowing the trade the Mariners made with the Braves, MLB Network's Jon Morosi believes Seattle has cleared payroll space and now has room to make a splash for top free agent slugger Cody Bellinger. Seattle has Julio Rodriguez in center, but with Teoscar Hernandez still on the market and Jarred Kelenic now dealt, there is room for him in the outfield.\n\nBlue Jays 'believed' to have met with Shohei Ohtani\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\n\nWhile one report earlier Monday indicated Ohtani isn't expected to sign before the end of the Winter Meetings, the process seems to be moving along.\n\nThe Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports Ohtani is \"believed\" to have met with the Blue Jays at the team's complex in Florida on Monday, far away from the meetings in Nashville. The Blue Jays have been pursuing Ohtani and Juan Soto in hopes of striking a deal for one of the two stars.\n\nShohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto decision not expected until after winter meetings\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, The New York Post\n\nThe baseball markets are waiting for the first major domino to fall this offseason in free agency, but it does not appear as though that will happen before the winter meetings conclude. Jon Heyman reports that neither Shohei Ohtani not Yoshinobu Yamamoto are expected to get a deal done before the final meetings on Wednesday.\n\nWade Miley back with Brewers on 1-year deal\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Jesse Rogers, ESPN\n\nAmid a turbulent offseason, the Brewers will keep one piece of their rotation intact as Wade Miley has agreed to return on a one-year deal for 2024 with a mutual option for 2025, per Rosenthal. According to Rogers, Miley will make a base salary of $7 million next season and the option is for $12 million with a $1.5 million buyout.\n\nThe 37-year-old lefty started 23 games for Milwaukee last year, gong 9-4 with a 3.14 ERA.\n\nBraves are reportedly 'engaged' with Shohei Ohtani's camp\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nIt's not surprising that any and all teams should be interested in Ohtani's services, but imagine the Braves landing the superstar? According to MLB Network's Jon Morosi, the Braves are \"engaged\" in talks with Ohtani's camp. Imagine a lineup consisting of Ohtani, Ronald Acuna Jr., Ozzie Albies, Austin Riley and Matt Olson?\n\nSources: Braves are among the teams still engaged with Shohei Ohtani\u2019s camp, as I reported in this @MLBNetwork segment. @MLB pic.twitter.com/lP4lISzttN \u2014 Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) December 4, 2023\n\nKorean star Jung Hoo Lee to be posted Monday\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\n\nSource: Jeeho Yoo, Yonhap News\n\nStar Korean outfielder Jung Hoo Lee is set for a move to MLB. His KBO team, Kiwoom Heroes, announced the 25-year-old will be posted Monday, so his 30-day negotiating window with MLB teams begins Tuesday at 8 a.m. ET.\n\nLee was hampered by injury in 2023 but slashed .349/.421/.575 in 2022 with 36 doubles, 10 triples and a career-best 23 home runs. He has a .340 career average in seven KBO seasons and has mostly played center field in recent years.\n\nBraves land Jarred Kelenic, Marco Gonzales from Mariners\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Ryan Divish, Seattle Times\n\nThe Braves have made a splash.\n\nAtlanta has traded its No. 7-ranked prospect, RHP Cole Phillips, and RHP Jackson Kowar to the Mariners in exchange for OF Jarred Kelenic, LHP Marco Gonzales, 1B Evan White and cash.\n\nKelenic, 24, is the headliner of the deal as a former No. 6 overall pick in the 2018 MLB Draft and top five-ranked prospect in 2021. The 24-year-old has not found any consistency in his MLB career thus far, hitting .206 with a .656 OPS through three tumultuous seasons. He has 32 home runs, 109 RBI and 24 stolen bases in 974 plate appearances.\n\nGonzales, 31, is also a decent rotation arm with 65 wins, 665 strikeouts and a 4.14 ERA over 893.0 innings pitched in his nine-year career.\n\nGiants emerging as possible frontrunners for Yoshinobu Yamamoto\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Susan Slusser, San Francisco Chronicle\n\nThe Giants have missed out on big names in the past like Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa, but they are looking to turn that around in 2023 with heavy involvement and Ohtani, among others. Per San Francisco Chronicle's Susan Slusser, teams believe the Giants \"might have an edge\" in the pursuit of Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\n\nDylan Cease trade market heating up\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nOne of the biggest names on the market early is White Sox ace Dylan Cease in trade talks. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported three teams, the Dodgers, Braves and Orioles, are among several involved discussing a deal for Cease as the winter meetings begin.\n\nRays, Mariners talking trades in winter meetings\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nThe Mariners and Rays have been frequent trade partners in recent years, and there's a chance they could be talking shop again at the winter meetings. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported the teams are discussing Rays utility infielder Isaac Paredes, and potentially star left fielder Randy Arozarena, in talks to start the winter meetings.\n\nJays unlikely to land both Ohtani, Soto\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nThe Blue Jays have been among the most active names in both the Ohtani and Soto markets. And of course, those talks have had fans dreaming of a lineup that features, Ohtani, Soto, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette and George Springer. But MLB Network's Jon Morosi said it's unlikely the Jays will land both star players, reporting they might land one of the two, but they will not add both this offseason.\n\nOhtani has already received several $500+ million offers\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, NY Post\n\nIt's no surprise the bidding for Ohtani is heating up, with the star expected to sign soon. And New York Post's Jon Heyman reported Ohtani has already received several deals that have topped $500 million, which could mean he winds up being the first $600 million player in MLB history. He added there are believed to be five teams in the running for Ohtani.\n\nDecision near for Ohtani\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nNothing gets the hot-stove crowd excited like a big move during the winter meetings, and the biggest move of the offseason could come this week in Nashville or soon after. Morosi reports Shohei Ohtani is \"likely to decide on a team within the next week,\" according to a source.\n\nStatus quo on Yankees' Juan Soto trade talks\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nThe Yankees reportedly are pushing hard to acquire Juan Soto from the Padres, but Heyman says the teams haven't spoken since San Diego requested a six-player package in return for Soto and Trent Grisham. That ask included pitchers Michael King and Drew Thorpe, who the Yankees aren't inclined to move. Stay tuned...\n\nShohei Ohtani field growing smaller\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 1\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nIt has been expected since before he hit free agency that Ohtani would set the record for the largest fully guaranteed contract in North American sports history, with Passan reporting the deal could reach as much as $600 million.\n\nWho will hand him that contract has been much more of a mystery. Little has been leaked about the top suitors for Ohtani beyond the usual suspects. Passan reported that at least three teams initially believed to be in the running \u2014 the Mets, Rangers and Red Sox \u2014 are believed to be out now. The teams most likely to still be in the mix are the Dodgers, Cubs, Blue Jays and Angels, with the Giants' status in the race for Ohtani unknown.\n\nStar players could be traded\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 1\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nThe free agency pool outside of Ohtani, Cody Bellinger, Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto is a bit lacking in star power, but the trade market could ensure several big-name players are on the move this offseason.\n\nPassan reported a trade of Soto appears to be \"edging closer to becoming a reality,\" and while several teams are out on him because of his large salary and pending free-agent status, there still could be a large market for the star outfielder.\n\nMuch of the rest of the names on the trade market are arms. Dylan Cease and Tyler Glasnow are the pitchers most likely to be dealt this offseason, and Cleveland could also hold a pair of intriguing trade chips in closer Emmanuel Clase and former Cy Young winner Shane Bieber. The Brewers have also begun trade talks for former Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes."

    "body": "Sure, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial has revealed that FTX was basically a seething mass of scams. But it has also revealed how Bankman-Fried blew up the lives of the people who are closest to him.\n\nOf course everyone who had money trapped on the FTX exchange when it collapsed \u2014 as the result of Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading firm Alameda Research purloining its customers\u2019 funds \u2014 had their lives altered. Even if they are made whole by the bankruptcy proceedings, that\u2019s still money that they should have had access to at any time they wanted it. That may mean houses that weren\u2019t purchased, medical procedures that were left undone, and life savings lost.\n\nThere is a simultaneous drama of ruined lives playing out in the courtroom\n\nBankman-Fried is charged with seven counts: two counts of wire fraud and five conspiracy charges. As we near the end of the prosecution\u2019s case, I have been struck by how bizarre it all is. All the co-conspirators seem oddly younger than their years, as though they got stuck in the \u201cmath camp forever\u201d environment Bankman-Fried created for them and simply failed to grow up.\n\nThe prosecution has made a strong case that Bankman-Fried presided over the various forms of fraud that played out at Alameda Research and FTX, orchestrating some of it and engaging in some of it directly. In the process of making this case, there is a simultaneous drama of ruined lives playing out in the courtroom.\n\nEveryone who loved Bankman-Fried most in the world is now caught up in the case. We have:\n\nAdam Yedidia, Bankman-Fried\u2019s college roommate, who testified with immunity because he was concerned he may have unknowingly worked on code that contributed to the fraud. \u201cI love you Sam,\u201d he texted at one point. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d That was before he realized FTX had stolen customer funds \u2014 at which point, he resigned.\n\nGary Wang, the co-founder of FTX and Alameda Research and another college roommate. He took the stand after Yedidia and sang like a canary about the secret privileges he\u2019d created for Alameda in the FTX code.\n\nNishad Singh, a longtime family friend, who copped to what sounded an awful lot like classic embezzlement. He said he\u2019d backdated transactions on FTX to help create doctored balance sheets to show to investors. He pleaded guilty to six charges, including wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy counts around his political donations.\n\nCaroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriend. She told us about the seven phony balance sheets she\u2019d created. She was clear: Alameda took customer funds; Bankman-Fried knew about it and even invested them against her advice.\n\nJoe Bankman, Bankman-Fried\u2019s father. He is among the people included in the \u201csmall group chat,\u201d the Signal group where the FTX inner circle strategized during the exchange\u2019s last days.\n\nBarbara Fried\u2019s political action committee, Mind the Gap. It is among the entities that received FTX customer money as political donations. Fried and Bankman lived together in a Bahamas house purchased for them using FTX investor funds, according to a financial expert called by the prosecution; in a lawsuit filed by FTX\u2019s bankruptcy estate, Bankman and Fried are alleged to have been given $10 million of FTX customer funds.\n\nGabe Bankman-Fried\u2019s nonprofit, Guarding Against Pandemics, which got millions from FTX. He was also in a Signal group chat, Donations Processing, that Singh says was used to coordinate the transfer of FTX and Alameda money to various political causes. In that chat, he can be seen recommending some donations be made \u201cin the dark\u201d to avoid public relations headaches. Singh also said Gabe had an assistant fly to the Bahamas with a stack of blank checks for Singh to sign.\n\nWang, Singh, and Ellison are now felons. Even if they never do time \u2014 and they may very well be imprisoned or subjected to house arrest \u2014 their lives are irrevocably changed, not least by whatever restitution requirements they are subjected to. They are barred from taking certain kinds of jobs. And of course, there is the publicity. Bankman, Fried, and Gabe Bankman-Fried\u2019s reputations are tarnished; in the political arenas where they once operated, they are suddenly undesirable.\n\nIt is a Greek tragedy, precipitated by one man\u2019s character flaw: the arrogance of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe general sense I got, from the testimony of Bankman-Fried\u2019s former friends, was that things just kept escalating\n\nDuring Yedidia\u2019s testimony, we were shown a photograph in court: former President Bill Clinton and former Prime Minister Tony Blair onstage in suits next to Bankman-Fried, in a rumpled T-shirt and cargo shorts. Sure, dressing down is a staple of Silicon Valley startup culture \u2014 and a sign of its swagger. The defense counsel tried to elicit testimony from Yedidia that the cargo shorts were evidence of Bankman-Fried\u2019s humility, but the photograph seemed to signify just the opposite: that the man in cargo shorts is so important, he doesn\u2019t need to dress up, even to meet former world leaders.\n\nNow, in court, Bankman-Fried is wearing a suit.\n\nIn 2019, just months after FTX was founded, Wang oversaw code called \u201callow_negative\u201d that let Alameda Research avoid being liquidated by FTX\u2019s risk management. It was turned on in July. No other customer trading on FTX had \u201callow_negative\u201d privileges \u2014 only Alameda. Wang\u2019s testimony suggests that the fraud at FTX started very early since the same day that allow_negative was switched on, Bankman-Fried tweeted that Alameda\u2019s account \u201cwas like everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe general sense I got, from the testimony of Bankman-Fried\u2019s former friends, was that things just kept escalating. For instance, Alameda Research first had a negative balance in late 2019, Wang testified. Wang testified that he heard Bankman-Fried tell another trader that it was okay to continue withdrawing money from the account as long as the amount was less than FTX\u2019s total trading revenue. A little later, Wang discovered that Alameda was negative by $50 million more than FTX\u2019s revenue. Bankman-Fried told him it was fine, and it just didn\u2019t account for the FTT token that the two of them had launched. Wang trusted him.\n\nWang also set Alameda Research up with an enormous line of credit, unmatched by anyone else on FTX. Ultimately, the number was $65 billion \u2014 the result of repeated increases as Alameda Research repeatedly ran up against its credit limit. This line of capital wasn\u2019t visible to auditors, Ellison testified. That credit line was used primarily for trading because it \u201callowed us to make profitable trades we couldn\u2019t have made otherwise,\u201d Ellison testified.\n\n\u201cOver time, it was something I became more comfortable with.\u201d\n\nWang\u2019s testimony revealed how the fraud got bigger, little by little. First, it was okay to dip into FTX\u2019s profits. Then, it was okay to take more. Then, it was okay to take even more. First, it was a little line of credit just to provide liquidity. Then a bigger one. Then an effectively limitless one.\n\nEllison testified to something similar, choking back tears: \u201cWhen I started working at Alameda, I don\u2019t think I would have believed you if you told me I would be sending false balance sheets to our lenders or taking customer money, but over time, it was something I became more comfortable with.\u201d\n\nEllison\u2019s tenure as CEO of Alameda Research was an exercise in optics, she testified. Alameda Research was, by then, FTX\u2019s sin-eater. When FTX took a loss in the hundreds of million dollars because a trader had exploited its system, Wang moved that loss onto Alameda\u2019s balance sheet. FTX\u2019s \u201cinsurance fund,\u201d meant to keep traders from getting stuck with other traders\u2019 losses, was totally made up \u2014 Alameda simply picked up the tab.\n\nEven that wasn\u2019t good enough. Singh testified to sprucing up FTX\u2019s balance sheet with backdated transactions in December 2021 to push FTX\u2019s revenue \u201cover the line\u201d to $1 billion. By the time Singh found out about the use of customer money, in 2022, he was already compromised.\n\nAt every turn, the scams at FTX and Alameda led back to making Bankman-Fried more important\n\nIn Singh\u2019s case, it wasn\u2019t just balance sheets he was fiddling with \u2014 it was also the American political system. By coordinating with Gabe Bankman-Fried, Singh had funneled money to a number of political causes. That money came from \u201cloans,\u201d which weren\u2019t really loans since he hadn\u2019t signed any term sheets.\n\nWhat was the goal here? What was accomplished? Singh testified to more than a billion dollars spent on celebrity endorsements, which made FTX very famous \u2014 even though the futures platform didn\u2019t operate in the US. The political donations gave Bankman-Fried influence in the highest echelons of power. Ellison testified to Bankman-Fried\u2019s venture investments, which gave him more dominance in the tech world. At every turn, the scams at FTX and Alameda led back to making Bankman-Fried more important.\n\nThe pie chart that accompanied expert witness Peter Easton\u2019s testimony. Image: The prosecution\u2019s exhibit 1045\n\nThis was backed up by expert testimony from Notre Dame accounting professor Peter Easton, who\u2019d also assisted in investigating Enron and WorldCom. In a pie chart that showed how he\u2019d traced funds for the $11.3 billion liability that Ellison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried had known about in June 2022, we saw that $1.2 billion was a loan repayment to crypto lender Genesis. A substantial chunk had been spent on various investments, including in the celebrity-connected venture firm K5, trading firm Modulo (co-founded by one of Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriends), and AI company Anthropic.\n\nAnother $413 million had gone directly to Bankman-Fried himself, through his wholly-owned company Paper Bird. \u201cOutflows to insiders,\u201d which suggested Singh\u2019s not-quite-loans were included, was $192 million; real estate was another $228 million; and the donations to Gabe Bankman-Fried\u2019s Guarding Against Pandemics, combined with the philanthropy from the FTX Foundation, totaled less than $40 million.\n\nIt is easy to lie with words and harder to lie with money. Bankman-Fried went around telling people that he wanted to make a lot of money to give it away, an idea of the Effective Altruism movement that Bankman-Fried affiliated himself with \u2014 but the amount of money he funneled to his Paper Bird vehicle alone was ten times the size of his philanthropic spending as outlined by Easton. And it was all vastly outweighed by his investments \u2014 the places where he could prove he was very smart by investing in the right companies early.\n\nAnd in brief, explosive testimony, former FTX lawyer Can Sun demonstrated what Bankman-Fried\u2019s tactic was. During the days in November when the exchange imploded, Bankman-Fried was trying to raise money from Apollo, the private equity group. Apollo wanted an explanation for what had happened, and so Bankman-Fried came to Sun to ask him to come up with justifications for the missing funds.\n\nThe defense has struggled to shake the credibility of witnesses such as Yedidia, Wang, and Ellison\n\nThat \u201cbasically confirmed my suspicions that had been rising all day\u201d that Bankman-Fried had purloined the funds, Sun said. He ran Bankman-Fried through possible explanations, including a margin loan program, and explained that none of them could fit the actual situation \u2014 for instance, Alameda had borrowed more from FTX than had ever been in the margin loan program. He said Bankman-Fried acknowledged their conversation with a \u201cyup, yup.\u201d \u201cI was expecting a bigger response, but it was very muted,\u201d Sun said.\n\nAfter that, Singh spilled the beans: Alameda had withdrawn assets that included the customer funds, Sun testified. He quit the next day. Like Yedidia, Sun testified with immunity.\n\nIn the courtroom, we were treated to a Good Morning America appearance by Bankman-Fried on December 1st, 2022. In it, Bankman-Fried tried to justify the missing funds through the margin loan program. It was such a flimsy excuse that even George Stephanopoulos could see through it.\n\nDid Bankman-Fried really think he could get away with it all? He must still think so, or he would not be dragging his closest companions\u2019 names through the mud in a jury trial. Throughout the entire prosecution\u2019s case, the defense has struggled to shake the credibility of witnesses such as Yedidia, Wang, and Ellison. The hits the defense made on Singh didn\u2019t make me doubt the overall truth of his story \u2014 they just made me think that Singh was kind of self-serving and trying to secure himself a lenient sentence."

However, for the best results, follow Northwar\u2019s path exactly.\n\nHow to make a great Sorcerer build\n\nSorcerers are Diablo 4\u2019s pure caster class, and use elemental magic to differentiate from the spells of the Druid and Necromancer. The Sorcerer has six Key Passives, but only three elements, which is what you\u2019ll base your build around:\n\nLightning\n\nFire\n\nIce\n\nLightning builds utilize Lightning skills to deal with large groups of enemies at once. When making a Lightning build, you\u2019ll end up using the Overflowing Energy Key Passive or the Vyr\u2019s Master Key Passive, depending on if you\u2019re in melee range or not.\n\nIce builds specialize in slowing enemies down, making it easier to survive their attacks. Ice builds will take advantage of either the Avalanche Key Passive or the Shatter Key Passive, depending on how much your build relies on crowd control\n\nFire builds are all about big explosions and burning your enemies. For these builds, you\u2019ll typically use either the Combustion Key Passive for burning enemies or the Esu\u2019s Ferocity Key Passive for chunky critical strikes.\n\nWhen making your own build for a Sorcerer, you\u2019ll likely end up sticking to one element for your main damage sources. But that\u2019s not the most important thing you need to remember. Sorcerers die very, very easily in Diablo 4, and they have the weakest defensive stats by far \u2014 however, they can deal a massive amount of damage when built correctly. If you don\u2019t want to end up dead more often than not, make sure to invest heavily in defensive skills while making your way toward one of the six Key Passives we listed above.\n\nLooking for other Diablo 4 builds? We have explainers on the Barbarian, Rogue, Druid, and Necromancer classes."

    "body": "Barbarians are a relatively simple class in Diablo 4: They smash stuff. However, Diablo 4 is underscored by math that\u2019s so complex that even the simple act of smashing stuff becomes a dizzying equation. That\u2019s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Barbarian builds for Diablo 4 season 2.\n\nBarbarians are big, muscular, and powerful. They excel at using Bleed to kill their enemies over time. And their unique weapon-swapping system means they get to have more Legendary powers at their disposal than any other class.\n\nIn this Diablo 4 guide, we\u2019ve gathered and simplified the best Diablo 4 Barbarian builds for season 2. If you need even more information on item affixes or other more complex ideas, we\u2019ve been sure to link out to the more detailed versions of these builds, as well as where to find their original creators.\n\nBest Barbarian leveling build\n\nThis build is based off Lexyu\u2019s Barbarian leveling guide at IcyVeins, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50. If you want more detailed information about the item affixes you want to look for on your gear, or which other Legendary powers are great for your build, check out the original IcyVeins guide.\n\nBest skills for leveling\n\nMost Barbarian leveling guides you\u2019ll find make use of Hammer of the Ancients as your primary skill, as it deals massive damage while remaining very cheap to cast. In this build, you\u2019ll also use Frenzy, Death Blow, Rallying Cry, Leap, and Wrath of the Berserker.\n\nHere are the best skills for a Barbarian leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in \u2014 bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you\u2019ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones:\n\nFrenzy / Enhanced Frenzy Hammer of the Ancients / Enhanced Hammer of the Ancients / Furious Hammer of the Ancients Combat Frenzy Rallying Cry / Enhanced Rallying Cry / Tactical Rallying Cry Hammer of the Ancients (ranks 2-3) Leap / Enhanced Leap / Power Leap Hammer of the Ancients (ranks 4-5) Death Blow / Enhanced Death Blow / Warrior\u2019s Death Blow / Death Blow (rank 2-5) Wrath of the Berserker / Prime Wrath of the Berserker / Supreme Wrath of the Berserker Pit Fighter (ranks 1-3) Tempered Fury Furious Impulse (ranks 1-3) Walking Arsenal Hamstring No Mercy Expose Vulnerability (ranks 1-3) No Mercy (ranks 2-3) Swiftness (ranks 1-3) Thick Skin (ranks 1-3) Counteroffensive (ranks 1-3) Defensive Stance (ranks 1-3) Slaying Strike (ranks 1-3) Aggressive Resistance Prolific Fury\n\nBest Weapon Expertise setup for leveling\n\nOnce you unlock the Weapon Expertise system for your Barbarian, you\u2019ll want to place the two-handed sword in your Technique slot. This will cause all of your Hammer of the Ancients damage to make enemies Bleed.\n\nBest Legendary Aspects for Barbarian leveling build\n\nWhen you first start your new character, complete these three dungeons first in order to collect their Aspects. Then place them on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace these Legendaries with new versions using the imprint system every few levels.\n\nAspect of Ancestral Force (Sunken Ruins dungeon in Scosglen) \u2014 Hammer of the Ancients quakes outwards, dealing X% of its damage to enemies\n\n(Sunken Ruins dungeon in Scosglen) \u2014 Hammer of the Ancients quakes outwards, dealing X% of its damage to enemies Aspect of the Expectant (Underroot dungeon in Scosglen) \u2014 Attacking enemies with a Basic Skill increases the damage of your next Core Skill cast by X% up to X%\n\n(Underroot dungeon in Scosglen) \u2014 Attacking enemies with a Basic Skill increases the damage of your next Core Skill cast by X% up to X% Edgemaster\u2019s Aspect (Oldstones dungeon in Scosglen) \u2014 Skills deal X% increased damage based on Primary Resource when cast, receiving the maximum benefit while you have full Primary Resource\n\nBarbarian Season 2 endgame build \u2014 Double Swing\n\nThis build is based off of AaronActionRPG\u2019s Double Swing Barbarian endgame guide at IcyVeins, and is a general endgame guide capable of finding success in all activities. This guide assumes that you\u2019re over level 50, have access to all 58 skill points, and are making progress on your Paragon Boards. If you want more detailed information about the item affixes you want to look for on your gear, or why these Legendary powers are great for your build, check out the original IcyVeins guide.\n\nBest skill points for Double Swing Barbarian endgame build\n\nThis build utilizes Double Swing as its core skill. It also uses Steel Grasp, Ground Stomp, Iron Maelstrom, Charge, and Lunging Strike.\n\nSince you need all 58 points for this build, the order you select these skills in doesn\u2019t matter as long as you have the pre-requisite points in the earlier Skill Tree tiers. Here is how you should spend your Skill Points for this build:\n\nLunging Strike / Enhanced Lunging Strike / Combat Lunging Strike\n\nDouble Swing (rank 1-5) / Enhanced Double Swing / Furious Double Swing\n\nEndless Fury\n\nGround Stomp (rank 1-5) / Enhanced Ground Stomp / Strategic Ground Stomp\n\nCharge (rank 1-5) / Enhanced Charge / Power Charge\n\nAggressive Resistance (rank 1-3)\n\nProlific Fury (rank 1-3)\n\nSteel Grasp / Enhanced Steel Grasp / Fighter\u2019s Steel Grasp\n\nThick Skin\n\nDefensive Stance (rank 1-3)\n\nCounteroffensive (rank 1-3)\n\nPit Fighter (rank 1-3)\n\nNo Mercy (rank 1-3)\n\nIron Maelstrom / Prime Iron Maelstrom / Supreme Iron Maelstrom\n\nDuelist (rank 1-3)\n\nWallop\n\nConcussion (rank 1-3)\n\nWalking Arsenal\n\nArsenal System for the Double Swing Barbarian build\n\nFor this build, you\u2019ll want to take One-Handed Mace in your Technique.\n\nVampiric Powers for Double Swing Barbarian build\n\nSeason 2 adds the new Vampiric Powers, which allow you to slot five additional abilities into your character to give you new effects.

However, for the best results, follow AaronActionRPG\u2019s path exactly.\n\nHow to make a great Barbarian build\n\nBarbarians are Diablo 4\u2019s only pure melee class, with the other classes having hybrid builds for multiple ranges. There are four main ideas that all Barbarian builds stem from:\n\nFury dumping (most popular in Diablo 4\u2019s pre-season)\n\nWeapon swapping\n\nBleed\n\nBerserk\n\nFury dump builds make use of the Unbridled Rage Key Passive, which causes your Fury spenders to cost double the Fury but deal more than double the damage. These kinds of builds obviously require very steady Fury generation, as it\u2019s easy to starve yourself. Berserk builds that use the Unconstrained Key Passive are all about keeping your Barbarian in the Berserk stage at all times, which nets you a hefty bonus. All Barbarian builds will likely use some skills that make them go Berserk, the Unconstrained Key Passive just enhances the effect.\n\nBleed builds use the Gushing Wounds Key Passive to create a critical strike heavy build that\u2019s great for whittling down groups of enemies with damage over time and explosions. Weapon swapping builds offer what is almost certainly the most unique playstyle for Barbarians and takes advantage of the Walking Arsenal Key Passive. The idea here is that you\u2019re constantly swapping between your skills and weapons to give yourself massive damage buffs.\n\nWhen making a build, you want to have one of these Key Passives in mind and choose your skills accordingly. Thankfully skills that share certain aspects (like Bleed) are color-coded on the skill tree, and you can even use the in-game search function to find them all. Other Barbarian builds let you take advantage of mechanics like Thorns or Shouts. But they still typically end with one of these Key Passives.\n\nLooking for other Diablo 4 builds?

    "body": "The world is watching the humanitarian crisis in Gaza unfold in real time through firsthand accounts documented on, of all places, Snapchat.\n\nIsrael has retaliated against Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack with unprecedented force against the Palestinian territory, claiming over 9,000 Palestinian lives according to Gaza Health Ministry numbers reported by the Associated Press.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists reports that at least 30 journalists have been killed since Israel\u2019s bombardment and total blockade of the region began, and journalists in Gaza say that without consistent access to food, water and power, it\u2019s becoming \u201cimpossible\u201d to continue reporting. Misinformation about the escalating violence is rampant on social media.\n\nAmid calls for a ceasefire, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) users are urging followers to view the devastation of Gaza for themselves on Snap Maps, which has displayed hot spots throughout northern Gaza since the Israeli airstrikes started last month. You don\u2019t need an account to view Snap Map \u2014 the desktop version of the map is publicly accessible.\n\n\u201cSnap Maps is a WEALTH of real-time information and is an important source for all journalists who aren\u2019t on the ground right now,\u201d X user inejmydarling posted.\n\nSnap didn\u2019t provide TechCrunch with hard data, but confirmed to TechCrunch that since October 7, the company has seen a \u201cmoderate\u201d increase in submissions to public Stories from Gaza. The company also said that more people from around the world are viewing content from the region. In the weeks since Israel\u2019s blockade of the territory began, screen recordings of the map, which displays bright red hotspots throughout northern Gaza, have been shared online.\n\nIn recent videos posted from Gaza City on Thursday night, for example, users recorded bombings from their windows. Videos posted from the previous morning showed smoke rising from remaining buildings, demolished neighborhoods and people crowding around medical vehicles for treatment.\n\nI\u2019m begging you guys to please PLEASE check snap maps. Look at the difference between the living conditions just a few miles away. The people of Gaza are posting these publicly for us to see and share. Please listen to them. These are all from today. You can check yourselves pic.twitter.com/L7LWjigk5t \u2014 \ud835\udcdc \u2740 \u25d3 (@uchihassasusaku) October 29, 2023\n\nSnap Map first launched in 2017 as a location-sharing feature that lets users see where their friends are posting Stories from, displayed on an interactive map. Users can also share their content to \u201cOur Story,\u201d a collaborative public archive of Stories posted from popular locations, which are displayed as hotspots on a \u201cheat map.\u201d If many users are posting Stories from around the same location, like a music festival, it\u2019ll show up on the heat map.\n\nIn the years since Snap Map launched, it\u2019s become an unexpected resource for keeping up with current events and highlighting political protests. Following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida in 2018, students used the map to document and archive the nationwide classroom walkout demanding stricter gun control. During the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Snapchat users posted videos expressing solidarity and recording instances of police violence against protestors.\n\nThis also isn\u2019t the first time that Snap Map has been used to demonstrate the disparity between Israeli cities and occupied Palestinian territories. The May 2021 court ruling to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah prompted weeks of protests internationally, and violent fighting between Hamas and Israel. On Snapchat\u2019s heat map, Stories posted throughout Israel showed users washing their cars and celebrating their birthdays. Stories posted from Gaza documented a neighborhood reduced to rubble.\n\nSnap Map is especially relevant as other mapping sites limit features in the region at the request of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). Google disabled live traffic conditions in Israel and the Gaza Strip for Google Maps and Waze last week, Bloomberg reports, \u201cout of consideration for the safety of local communities.\u201d Users can still use navigational features to get around, but aren\u2019t able to see real-time traffic data, according to Bloomberg, because live updates could reveal the Israeli military\u2019s movements. The Hill reports that Apple Maps took similar action in compliance with the IDF\u2019s request.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t indifferent to geopolitical conflict, however. Last year, Snap disabled its heat map in Ukraine as a \u201csafety precaution,\u201d The Verge said, to prevent Russia from tracking civilian evacuations. Instead, Snap displayed a \u201ccurated feed\u201d of public Stories.\n\nA spokesperson for Snap told TechCrunch that Snap Map will stay live to allow users to continue sharing their experiences during the crisis, and that the company is monitoring hot spots for content that may spread misinformation or incite violence. Snap will \u201cclosely assess\u201d if it needs to take additional action.\n\nThe spokesperson also acknowledged that Snap Map is a crucial resource for \u201cauthentic user-generated content\u201d from perspectives that may not be reflected by traditional news outlets.\n\nSnap Map has served as an alternative source of eyewitness accounts during times of social unrest, as young people increasingly perceive news media reporting as \u201cbiased.\u201d Trust in legacy media is waning in younger generations \u2014 a 2022 Pew Research Center survey found that American adults under 30 trust information from social media nearly as much as they trust information from national news outlets. A report conducted by the Knight Foundation earlier this year concluded that perceptions of political bias in news have increased, and young people hold more negative perceptions of news media than their predecessors. Younger people also consume the most online news, but report the lowest trust in national news outlets.\n\nAlthough Snapchat isn\u2019t immune to misinformation, it\u2019s worth noting that spreading fake content via Our Story isn\u2019t as easy as reposting a video on X or TikTok. Users can upload content from their camera roll to their own Stories, but it won\u2019t be eligible for Our Stories. Snap encourages users to \u201ccapture what\u2019s happening\u201d around them to increase their chances of making it to Our Stories. The submission guidelines say that the company looks for \u201cSnaps that provide a window into everyday life.\u201d\n\nUsers are also turning to Snapchat for information about Gaza as accusations of shadowbanning Palestinian content fuel distrust in platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Meta\u2019s policies aren\u2019t dissimilar to Snap\u2019s Community Guidelines, which prohibit pornographic content, content that advocates or advances terrorism and content that portrays gratuitous or graphic violence. Allegations of censorship against Snapchat aren\u2019t as frequent as they are against Meta\u2019s platforms, but many users are still urging others to screen record Stories posted from Gaza in case they are taken down.\n\nSome are also concerned that internet access in Gaza, which was partially restored after Israel imposed a communications blackout, will be cut again. TikTok creator divergentredhed posted that she watched the blackout happen in real time on Snapchat.\n\n\u201cRight there in Gaza it was like a hotspot of Snapchat Stories. It was yellow and green and red \u2026 all of it just went dark. The entire Gaza Strip went dark before my very eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to spend the next few days uploading all of the content I have from Snapchat, from the people themselves.\u201d"

    "body": "The first week of fighting in the bitter war in Israel\u2019s south is almost over, with the financial markets trying to gauge the damage that the Israeli economy will sustain. Clearly, we are talking about a very significant event, but the fog of war makes it hard to estimate its full consequences. The main index on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the Tel Aviv 35, fell 6.4% over the week.\n\nProf. Leo Leiderman, chief economic adviser at Bank Hapoalim and a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University, sets out for \"Globes\" his proposals for rehabilitating the economy and repairing the damage that the war will cause.\n\nWhat has been going through your mind in these first days of the war?\n\n\"What most preoccupies me is not the economy but concern for the families of the soldiers, the wounded, and the captives, and solidarity with them. I have four relatives from Kibbutz Nir Oz who are still missing, and we have no information about them. I find it hard to understand how a war like this landed on us in a country as powerful as Israel. But we have no choice but to win.\"\n\nAs for the effect of the war on economic activity, Leiderman says: \"First of all, the duration and character of the war will have a decisive impact on the depth of damage to the economy. Many studies, as well as past experience, indicate that the longer the war lasts, the broader will be the impact on the economy. It is also known that this connection between the length of the fighting and the economic damage might not be linear. And of course, the more the war widens to more fronts, the greater will be the economic damage.\"\n\nDo you have a forecast for the consequences of the war for economic growth?\n\n\"It\u2019s too early to make a quantitative estimate of the effects on the growth of the economy in 2024 and 2025. We have a great deal of information about loss of growth and product in various episodes in the past, such as the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon War, two intifadas, various military operations, and the Covid pandemic.\n\n\"We see this is a completely different episode, however. This is a new situation that has no precedent as far as the damage to the economy is concerned. There\u2019s a whole spectrum of possible scenarios, from a short war on the southern front only, to the nightmare scenario of a prolonged war with additional sectors involved. We are only in the fifth day of the war, and it\u2019s to be hoped that the picture will start to become clearer.\"\n\nWhich industries will be hit by the war?\n\n\"A substantial decline can be expected in private consumption, particularly of services. This is not just because of the damage to output and income, but also for psychological reasons. Distress, uncertainty, the possibility of prolonged reserve duty by some of the public - all these things will affect consumer sentiment. Alongside this, tourism, commerce, transport services, entertainment, and restaurants will be hurt. As in the Covid pandemic, the self-employed and small and medium-size businesses may be hurt, particularly those that operate with high leverage.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Bank of Israel announced a dramatic plan to sell $30 billion of its foreign currency reserves to stabilize the shekel. The shekel has in fact recovered slightly, and is traded at around NIS 3.96/$.\n\nWhat\u2019s your view of the Bank of Israel\u2019s move in the foreign exchange market?\n\nLeiderman: \"It\u2019s important to welcome the Bank of Israel\u2019s decision to intervene, as necessary, in the foreign exchange market, in order to ensure the market\u2019s regular operation. The decision to extend the term of Amir Yaron as governor of the bank at least for the duration of the war, and I hope beyond that, is also a stabilizing factor. The banking system is stable, and there is enough liquidity in the system. The behavior of the investment community in Israel, including the financial institutions, indicates high confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience and financial strength. It\u2019s important to maintain a level-headed, correct economic policy that will preserve this \u2018asset.\u2019\"\n\nWhat about the economic cost of the war?\n\n\"As with any war, the current war has and will have direct and indirect impacts. The war will substantially raise defense spending in the coming years, for procurement of equipment, ammunition, and advanced systems in accordance with the new needs. Another direct expense is payment for the reserve duty days of those mobilized. Given current interest rate levels around the world, the cost of servicing public debt as a proportion of GDP will rise. Besides all this, there will be a decline in state revenues from taxation and a rise in the fiscal deficit.\"\n\nHow can this larger deficit be financed?\n\n\"It\u2019s reasonable to argue that besides the hope of financing part of the deficit through aid from the US (President Biden approved $8 billion military aid this week, H. S.), and that will happen, it\u2019s permissible for a country at war to raise its fiscal deficit by what is seen as the right amount. This is in order to ensure that the economy functions properly, to carry out rehabilitation actions, and to prepare for recovery and a return to growth in the near future.\"\n\nHow high should the deficit go?\n\n\"I mean a deficit of 3% of GDP, or 5%, or 8% - there are no sacred numbers. As was said during the Covid pandemic, the state has to do whatever it takes to achieve these goals. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to make sure that the growth in expenditure and in the deficit is temporary, until economic activity gets back to normal. I\u2019m also sure that there are various budget items that were approved that don\u2019t support economic growth, and that don\u2019t need to be implemented in the new reality. Such a policy will be accepted with complete understanding by investors overseas and in Israel, and also by the credit rating agencies.\"\n\nWhat else do you propose on the economic policy plane?\n\n\"Despite the uncertainty over how the war will develop, alongside an emergency budget, this is the time to start preparing a general economic plan with a strategy for rehabilitating the economy after the war. It\u2019s important to start planning professionally and in detail all aspects of rehabilitating the settlements that have been damaged or destroyed in the south, rehabilitation of infrastructure, the health system, and the civilian systems that need attention.\"\n\nHow do you propose doing this?\n\n\"One possibility is to task the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance Budgets Division with coordinating the work, with help from the various research institutes and economists, engineers, and professionals in academic institutions and in the private sector. It\u2019s important to talk to the private sector, and to understand in every place and every industry what the main damage is and what they need in order to get back to normal. It should be done professionally, preferably with no politicization of the recommendations.\"\n\nWhat do you think the Bank of Israel should do in its next interest rate decision, on October 23?\n\n\"It\u2019s still to early to tell how the war will affect the rate of inflation in the short and medium term. Just as there are new inflationary factors, such as the depreciation of the shekel, there will also be factors working in the opposite direction, given the expected decline in private consumption, tourism, and other items.\n\n\"As with fiscal policy, here too a country at war is allowed to deviate temporarily from the set inflation target. At the moment there is no surge in inflation expectations, and the investment community is aware of the existence of index-linked assets and the exchange rate that can assist in hedging inflation risk.\n\n\"As for cutting the interest rate, it\u2019s too early to consider that. The current interest rate is at the right level for the state of the economy, and together with the policy on exchange rates, it contributes to ensuring financial stability,\" Leiderman concludes.\n\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on October 12, 2023.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023."

    "body": "This week, Google took the wraps off of Gemini, its new flagship generative AI model meant to power a range of products and services including Bard, Google\u2019s ChatGPT competitor. In blog posts and press materials, Google touted Gemini\u2019s superior architecture and capabilities, claiming that the model meets or exceeds the performance of other leading gen AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\n\nBut the anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nA \u201clite\u201d version of Gemini, Gemini Pro, began rolling out to Bard yesterday, and it didn\u2019t take long before users began voicing their frustrations with it on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe model fails to get basic facts right, like 2023 Oscar winners:\n\nI'm extremely disappointed with Gemini Pro on Bard. It still give very, very bad results to questions that shouldn't be hard anymore with RAG. A simple question like this with a simple answer like this, and it still got it WRONG. pic.twitter.com/5GowXtscRU \u2014 Vitor de Lucca \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 / threads.net/@vitor_dlucca (@vitor_dlucca) December 7, 2023\n\nNote that Gemini Pro claims incorrectly that Brendan Gleeson won Best Actor last year, not Brendan Fraser \u2014 the actual winner.\n\nI tried asking the model the same question and, bizarrely, it gave a different wrong answer:\n\n\u201cNavalny,\u201d not \u201cAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed,\u201d won Best Documentary Feature last year; \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d won Best International Film; \u201cWomen Talking\u201d won Best Adapted Screenplay; and \u201cPinocchio\u201d won Best Animated Feature Film. That\u2019s a lot of mistakes.\n\nScience fiction author Charlie Stross found many more examples of confabulation in a recent blog post. (Among other mistruths, Gemini Pro said that Stross contributed to the Linux kernel; he never has.)\n\nTranslation doesn\u2019t appear to be Gemini Pro\u2019s strong suit, either. It struggles to give a six-letter word in French:\n\nFYI, Google Gemini is complete trash. pic.twitter.com/EfNzTa5qas \u2014 Benjamin Netter (@benjaminnetter) December 6, 2023\n\nWhen I ran the same prompt through Bard (\u201cCan you give me a 6-letters word in French?\u201d), Gemini Pro responded with a seven-letter word instead of a five-letter one \u2014 which gives some credence to the reports about Gemini\u2019s poor multilingual performance.\n\nWhat about summarizing news? Surely Gemini Pro, with Google Search and Google News at its disposal, can give a recap of something topical? Not necessarily.\n\nIt seems Gemini Pro is loath to comment on potentially controversial news topics, instead telling users to\u2026 Google it themselves.\n\nI tried the same prompt and got a very similar response. ChatGPT, by contrast, gives a bullet-list summary with citations to news articles:\n\nInterestingly, Gemini Pro did provide a summary of updates on the war in Ukraine when I asked it for one. However, the information was over a month out of date:\n\nGoogle emphasized Gemini\u2019s enhanced coding skills in a briefing earlier this week. Perhaps it\u2019s genuinely improved in some areas \u2014 posts on X suggest as much. But it also appears that Gemini Pro struggles with basic coding functions like this one in Python:\n\nTried gemini based Bard, and well, it still can't write intersection of two polygons. It's one of those rare relatively simple to express functions that wasn't ever implemented in python, there is no stack overflow post, and all these models fail on it. pic.twitter.com/RKjmkEw2Qr \u2014 Filip Piekniewski\ud83c\udf3b \ud83d\udc18:@filippie509@techhub.social (@filippie509) December 6, 2023\n\nAnd these:\n\nTrying out Gemini Pro: it is pretty disappointing for my example. I asked it to make an analog clock using HTML like this one that ChatGPT made. It can cite some code from Github but it's off by a few ms\u2026 pic.twitter.com/neb42Vzm3m \u2014 Mohsen Azimi (@mohsen____) December 7, 2023\n\nGPT 4 still greater than Gemini Pro. Created Tic Tac Toe game with ChatGPT and Bard(Running on Gemini Pro) See video for the result. ChatGPT wrote the code on first try(First Video). Bard on 3 tries(Second Video). pic.twitter.com/cYd9hepcgT \u2014 Edison Ade (@buzzedison) December 6, 2023\n\nJust tested Google's Bard with Gemini Pro update. No bugless snake game on 1st try; reported, asked to fix\u2014couldn't. Tried ChatGPT 3.5 free version, got correct bug-free code on the first attempt! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d #ChatGPT #Bard #Gemini pic.twitter.com/WQfilgG21D \u2014 N KIRAN KUMAR (@NKIRANKUMARS1) December 6, 2023\n\nAnd, as with all generative AI models, Gemini Pro isn\u2019t immune to \u201cjailbreaks\u201d \u2014 i.e. prompts that get around the safety filters in place to attempt to prevent it from discussing controversial topics.\n\nUsing an automated method to algorithmically change the context of prompts until Gemini Pro\u2019s guardrails failed, AI security researchers at Robust Intelligence, a startup selling model-auditing tools, managed to get Gemini Pro to suggest ways to steal from a charity and assassinate a high-profile individual (albeit with \u201cnanobots\u201d \u2014 admittedly not the most realistic weapon of choice).\n\nNow, Gemini Pro isn\u2019t the most capable version of Gemini \u2014 that model, Gemini Ultra, is set to launch sometime next year in Bard and other products. Google compared the performance of Gemini Pro to GPT-4\u2019s predecessor, GPT-3.5, a model that\u2019s around a year old.\n\nBut Google nevertheless promised improvements in reasoning, planning and understanding with Gemini Pro over the previous model powering Bard, claiming Gemini Pro was better at summarizing content, brainstorming and writing. Clearly, it has some work to do in those departments."

    "body": "Even to its owners, the name for their new Thai restaurant seemed silly and unserious. Some of them were embarrassed to tell friends about it at all, for fear of it sounding too ridiculous.\n\nBut Teddy Jirapraphanan, one of the four owners, thought back to his own experience using Google to find restaurants.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I go, I\u2019m craving Thai food,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to search \u2018Thai food near me\u2019 all the time.\u201d\n\nJirapraphanan is exactly the kind of customer Thai Food Near Me hopes to scoop up. The New York-based restaurant is named after a literal Google search, betting it can bring in customers with the power of SEO \u2014 the practice of making a business, website, or content more findable in search engine results. The restaurant is optimized for the digital platforms diners use to find places nearby, not for the person walking past on the street or getting a recommendation from a friend.\n\nThai Food Near Me is a small but powerful symbol of Google\u2019s far-reaching impact on businesses over the past two decades and the lengths their owners will go to try to optimize their operations for the company\u2019s platforms. The name is both notable and obvious \u2014 if you\u2019ve spent any amount of time searching for things online, you will understand the reference immediately. The turn is that 25 years after Google Search first arrived, the name says the quiet part out loud.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a million restaurants close by, you will be in the bottom [of rankings] if it\u2019s a random name,\u201d Jirapraphanan says. \u201cBut [when] we used Thai Food Near Me, people started knowing us.\u201d Customers, like Jirapraphanan, were searching for the exact phrase and stumbling upon the restaurant, they told him.\n\nIn March, a photo of the restaurant went viral on Twitter ahead of its opening, brown butcher paper still covering the windows. The restaurant\u2019s goofy name was enough to garner coverage on news sites, along with an influx of customers in the first crucial months of being open.\n\nThe viral tweet invariably summoned a chorus of overly friendly, all-lowercase-text replies from brands looking for attention. The official account of Google Maps \u2014 the very entity the meme-y restaurant name is designed to outsmart \u2014 couldn\u2019t resist.\n\n\u201cVery relatable,\u201d the company replied, with a crown emoji. But response to its presence in the thread was mixed.\n\nOne person replied, \u201cThis is about how your products don\u2019t even work anymore.\u201d\n\nThai Food Near Me is located on a busy street in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan.\n\nThai Food Near Me isn\u2019t the first business to think of the Google-first naming convention. There are reminders of Google\u2019s kingmaker status in online discoverability everywhere in cities across the country.\n\nAmong the businesses I was able to find: a chain of half a dozen Affordable Dentist Near Me\u2019s in Texas; an Antiques Near Me two hours outside of New York City; seven Plumber Near Me businesses; a Phone Repair Near Me in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; a Psychic Near Me in Chicago; and more than 20 iterations of \u201cNotary Near Me\u201d across the US.\n\nFelix Silva decided on the name Barber Shop Near Me after considering more than 20 other options for his Coral Springs, Florida, store in 2019. The name is meant to be neutral and memorable \u2014 another one in contention was \u201cThe Barber Shop\u201d \u2014 but Silva fully leaned into the Google joke: the logo is a red location pin resembling Google\u2019s own, with a blue, white, and red barber pole pattern in the middle.\n\nSilva had seen firsthand how a business\u2019s Google presence could help or hurt its chances of success\n\n\u201cBefore we opened, we just had a logo [on an Instagram account]. And we had some clients then tell us, \u2018Oh, man, before you guys opened we thought Google was coming to town,\u201d Silva says.\n\nLike Jirapraphanan, Silva had seen firsthand how a business\u2019s Google presence could help or hurt its chances of success \u2014 Silva frequently searches for keywords like \u201cvegan\u201d to find restaurants. One time, Google returned results for a restaurant that wasn\u2019t vegan but had a customer review that contained the keyword that was highlighted.\n\n\u201cIt was a light bulb moment\u2026 like, \u2018Okay, this is the path I need to take. I really need to dial in and focus on the online presence, specifically Google, because that is going to be the foundation of the business,\u201d Silva says.\n\nAs with Thai Food Near Me, the most powerful thing an SEO-driven name might be able to do is get customers in the door. From there, it\u2019s up to a business to give them a good experience, whether that\u2019s a great plate of pad see ew or the perfect haircut. Then, the cycle continues \u2014 happy customers leave good reviews. Good reviews help the business\u2019s Google Maps profile rank higher. Silva uploads high-quality photos and videos to the page and shares updates, too. That\u2019s another SEO move; some experts say active profiles can improve a business\u2019s rankings.\n\nStill, the naming scheme has caught on: one acquaintance selling Christmas trees, for example, rebranded his business to be called Christmas Trees Near Me, Silva says. (Silva\u2019s is not the only Barber Shop Near Me, either \u2014 there are also shops with the same name in Oak Park, Illinois; Queens, New York; and Muskogee, Oklahoma, according to Google Maps.)\n\n\u201cIt was a compliment. It was nice to see that in some way this inspires some people,\u201d Silva says of the Christmas tree company rebrand. But he\u2019s always thinking about what\u2019s next, what could give his business the edge to keep growing. Sometimes he wonders if an influx of \u201cnear me\u201d businesses could water down the impact.\n\nBut Google is Google, Silva says, and \u201cnear me\u201d is wherever a customer is.\n\nThai Food Near Me owners Jirapraphanan, Sampson, Natkitta Kornwaewwongcharoen, and Nat P Akethamwong.\n\nWhether this attempt at SEO is actually a boon to these businesses is a separate question \u2014 a Google Maps search for \u201cThai food near me\u201d from my home in Brooklyn yielded plenty of options literally near me but not Jirapraphanan\u2019s business just a few miles away.\n\nRobert Sampson, a co-owner of Thai Food Near Me who handles much of the back-end tasks including working on SEO, says he followed the discussion online about the utility of the name.\n\n\u201cThe people who said that [the name is] not such a good idea\u2026 I think they\u2019re responding more from a national brand campaign. It is true that if you\u2019re in California, and you type \u2018Thai food near me,\u2019 you\u2019re going to have a little bit of a hard time finding us,\u201d Sampson says. \u201cBut for local search, I think the name works really well.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cThai food near me\u201d is searched, on average, nearly a million times a month in the US, according to Semrush, a company that provides keyword research and other popular SEO tools. Semrush notes you\u2019ll need referring domains and optimized content to try to compete for the term and grades it as \u201cdifficult\u201d to rank for \u2014 competitive, but not even the hardest category.\n\nBefore serving a single person, the restaurant had gone viral online for its name.\n\nAdding \u201cnear me\u201d to a search term is both a learned behavior and encouraged by Google. \u201c___ near me\u201d is a top autofilled search suggestion on both Search and Maps and has become synonymous with Google \u2014 that\u2019s why the joke works.\n\nFor a group I spoke with at Thai Food Near Me on an evening in August, the SEO plan \u2014 at least practically \u2014 had the intended effect. One of the diners, Travis, found Thai Food Near Me on Yelp when searching for nearby dining options after missing an earlier reservation elsewhere. Several people in the group had heard about the restaurant when it went viral this spring but didn\u2019t realize it was in New York.\n\nThe group agreed the food was good, even though they didn\u2019t know what to expect. They\u2019d definitely consider coming back if they were in the area, they told me.\n\nSo did the clever SEO hack of a name actually help bump Thai Food Near Me above its nearby competitors in search results?\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Danny Sullivan, Google\u2019s public liaison for Search, says. Owners doing this might find success, but Google pulls in other data to serve results to users, like location, reviews, or ratings \u2014 a \u201chodgepodge of different things that we have that are out there.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s public documentation says it uses three categories to rank results that are local to a searcher: relevance, distance, and prominence. To improve local ranking, Google encourages businesses to provide a trove of information on their profile. Owners should have basics like updated hours of operation and accurate location details, but they should also respond to reviews, add photos, and even post individual items in stock to their Google page.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re really great marketing campaigns\u201d\n\nThe prominence measure in Maps includes data from the web \u2014 links to the business, how the business ranks in traditional search, and press coverage, for example. In this way, SEO impacts how a business appears in local search results, and news articles and links are one way Google tries to determine the relevance of a page. (It\u2019s why reporters\u2019 inboxes are overrun with spammy requests to buy \u201cguest posts\u201d on our sites from marketers.)\n\nIronically, a search I did in Google Maps for \u201cThai food near me\u201d from Wisconsin surfaced the Manhattan restaurant as a suggestion, above any local businesses \u2014 it was easier to find it from the Midwest than it was from Brooklyn. Sullivan says this could be due to Google recognizing there\u2019s a business with an exact match name that has some degree of notoriety that people are searching for in different areas. It could encourage other people to name their businesses in this style, but Sullivan says he doesn\u2019t see it as an issue that needs addressing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen these kinds of things over the years, and they kind of make me laugh and have a bit of a chuckle. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really great marketing campaigns,\u201d Sullivan told The Verge. Google\u2019s advice has always been that businesses should make decisions that serve their customers, not the platform, he says.\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s \u201csecret menu\u201d has speciality dishes.\n\nSullivan might say that a \u201cnear me\u201d name isn\u2019t a silver bullet to gaming the search engine algorithm \u2014 but in a roundabout way, the name really did help Thai Food Near Me.\n\nIts initial SEO \u201chack\u201d was likely technically ineffective, but it was memorable and funny. The joke led to many, many, many articles and forum posts about the restaurant\u2019s name, which tipped the SEO scales in its favor. All of this content, including the story you\u2019re reading now, will help Thai Food Near Me\u2019s prominence on Google platforms. One SEO trick has eaten another.\n\nEven if the name doesn\u2019t work on Google exactly how Sampson and Jirapraphanan expected, it clearly has pulled in customers \u2014 Sampson says that for the first several months of being open, most people were coming in after seeing Twitter and Reddit posts, not Google results. Others would walk by outside, do a double take at the sign, and come inside.\n\n\u201cAfter you get that initial bunch, you\u2019ve got people who enjoyed their dining experience here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell all their friends and family if they liked it, and then those people come from word of mouth.\u201d\n\nCo-owner Jirapraphanan designed the restaurant\u2019s menu.\n\nDespite the admittedly silly name, it\u2019s clear that Thai Food Near Me\u2019s Jirapraphanan and Sampson care about what they\u2019re serving: the restaurant is clean and stylish, and the menu, carefully designed by Jirapraphanan, features original dishes I haven\u2019t seen at other places. My food is tasty, comes out promptly, and I, too, will note the spot if I\u2019m ever in the area again and craving Thai food.\n\nJirapraphanan wants people to come back because they actually like the food. The name is part \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the branding. \u201cI want to be different from other Thai restaurants,\u201d he tells me.\n\nBut we\u2019re in an era of dining where one viral video online could make or break a restaurant, and business owners must be strategic about getting their operation in front of potential customers. (Thai Food Near Me is at least the fourth Thai restaurant to occupy the same location, according to defunct delivery and review websites I was able to dig up; Jirapraphanan was told they\u2019re the fifth.) As New York Magazine reported, the allure of a social media hit is shaping the very food being served \u2014 gooier eggs, more obscene cheese, sauces exploding and gushing across a plate. If the algorithm and diner-slash-viewers want messier, spectacle-driven dishes, many restaurants are complying.\n\nIn some ways, Thai Food Near Me has optimized its food, too. The owners have tweaked their menu and modification options on delivery apps like Uber Eats or DoorDash, according to common written requests they get on online orders. It\u2019s a savvy business decision, Sampson says, and a way to get \u2014 and keep \u2014 loyal customers. It\u2019s what\u2019s required for a business to survive when diners have endless options at their fingertips.\n\n\u201cAt first we were a little too proud of our Thai food. We wanted to make it how we think you should have it. Well, that\u2019s not actually a smart idea. It\u2019s the other way around,\u201d Sampson says. \u201cWe now want to make it however you most want it.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant is still in its early days; good restaurants shutter for reasons that are no fault of their own. But Sampson and Jirapraphanan are content with their choice of name.\n\n\u201cI think it did more than we could have ever imagined it would do,\u201d Sampson says."

    "body": "Manchester United got themselves back to winning ways thanks to a superb Scott McTominay brace against Chelsea.\n\nThe victory remarkably puts them within three points of rivals Manchester City, after the reigning champions were defeated by Aston Villa, and keeps them in reach of the top four places.\n\nMcTominay is now United's top scorer for the season with six goals, one ahead of Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund. The Red Devils' captain had a first-half penalty saved by Robert Sanchez and United's Danish striker was substituted after another Premier League game without a goal, despite making 11 appearances.\n\nErik ten Hag's side were dominant in the first half and finally pounced on Chelsea's inability to take control in midfield. Mauricio Pochettino's men attempted to break at pace but Sofyan Amrabat made a vital interception and Fernandes found Alejandro Garnacho out wide. The youngster then cut the ball back to Harry Maguire whose effort rebounded perfectly into the path of McTominay. The Scotland international took one touch before blasting past Sanchez.\n\nUnited led for the majority of the first 45 minutes but failed to build on their lead and were pegged back by the former Manchester City man, Cole Palmer. The 21-year-old, who made the transfer from the Etihad Stadium to Stamford Bridge in August, stroked the ball into the far corner with deadly accuracy. It was his fifth Premier League goal of the season and his first from open play.\n\nBut United continued to put Chelsea under pressure in the second half and after numerous attempts, McTominay headed powerfully past Sanchez. The Scotsman had seven shots, his most ever in a league game. Despite a flurry of late attacks driven by Reece James, Ten Hag's team stood strong and held on to see out the victory.\n\nUnited have now won their past 19 Premier League games at Old Trafford when scoring first, including all 16 under their Dutch manager.\n\nMORE: Every game on Amazon in December and how to watch\n\nTen Hag: Crisis? What crisis?\n\nThe United manager faced a demanding week amid reports indicating disunity within his team and his players did exceptionally well to block out the noise and focus on footballing matters.\n\nWhen asked about a potential crisis, he said: \u201cCrisis? Not for us. We keep calm. We know where we have to build. We are going in the right direction. This team is capable to be successful.\u201d\n\nAnd United were successful tonight, thanks to McTominay. Ten Hag explained how his midfielder has managed to become more involved in an attacking sense this season: \"He has a very good smell when to arrive and a very good finish.\n\n\"It is not a frustration, in the end, we won but we could have made our lives much easier,\" he said. \"We started very good, proactive, brave, we created a lot of chances in that moment, we could have gone up with two or three goals.\"\n\nMan United vs Chelsea final score\n\nFinal score Goalscorers Man United 2 McTominay 19', 70' Chelsea 1 Palmer 45'\n\nMan United vs Chelsea live updates, highlights from Premier League\n\nFT: United can breathe a sigh of relief and hold onto a crucial three points!\n\n90th minute: Broja hits the post! That was so close to the equaliser for Chelsea. There are four minutes of added time.\n\n80th minute: Garnacho so nearly makes it 3-1 to United but his delicately finish toys with the goalline.\n\n74th minute: An insane recovery run and block by Reece James denies Garnacho from doubling United's lead. He was picked out superbly by Onana to kickstart a rapid counter by the hosts.\n\n70th minute: GOAL! 2-1 United! And it's McTominay who has a brace! It's a great ball to the back post by Garnacho and McTominay meets the header from inside the six-yard box. He's in terrific goalscoring form and becomes United's top scorer this season.\n\n69th minute: Antony tries one of his trademark curling efforts from the right after cutting in on his left but it's wide of the goal.\n\n62nd minute: Penalty appeal for United! Shaw rockets an attempt goalwards and it looked as though Colwill may have blocked it with his hand. VAR took a quick look and play continues.\n\n61st minute: Antony's trivela is deflected for a corner, it may have been going wide.\n\n54th minute: Unfortunately for Garnacho, lightning doesn't strike twice. His latest acrobatic effort is well wide of the goal.\n\n49th minute: Jackson has a glorious chance at the back post to make it 2-1 but he can't keep his header down!\n\n46th minute: Both sides make a change at the break. Sergio Reguilon comes on for Lindelof and much to the delight of the Chelsea fans, Reece James comes on for Cucurella.\n\nHT: That's all from a hectic first half, hopefully more of it to come in the second!\n\n45th minute: GOAL! 1-1! The former City man finds the bottom corner with a delicate stroke past Onana. It's a wonderful goal from Cole Palmer to pull level right before the break.\n\n36th minute: And that should be the equaliser! Mudryk finds himself in the box on his weak foot but the Chelsea forward drags his effort wide.\n\n32nd minute: McTominay should have his second! Fernandes picks him out beautifully from the left but the Scotsman heads directly at Sanchez. Either side of the Chelsea goalkeeper and United would have a two-goal lead.\n\n25th minute: Penalty appeal for Chelsea! Sterling drops to the floor after very minimal contact with Victor Lindelof but neither the referee nor VAR buy his theatrics.\n\n19th minute: GOAL! 1-0 United! Scott McTominay finishes off a scrappy period of play and United have a deserved lead.\n\n18th minute: Silva's block denies Antony the opener. He's not scored at Old Trafford since his debut...\n\n15th minute: It's all gone a bit wild here as neither side appears to have a midfield capable of dictating the play. Chelsea have just had two glorious chances but Mudryk couldn't beat Onana and Fernandes made a brilliant recovery run to prevent the other attack.\n\n9th minute: SAVED! It's a woeful penalty from Fernandes and Sanchez makes an easy diving save to his right.\n\n7th minute: PENALTY! It's United who are rewarded for their bright start as Antony was brought down by Enzo Fernandez in the box. Chris Kavanagh originally waved play on, however, VAR instructed him to take a look at the monitor and the referee gives the penalty.\n\n4th minute: Sanchez makes a great save to deny Hojlund the opener, who was well found by Luke Shaw.\n\n3rd minute: Dalot picks out Fernandes on the edge of the box who blasts well over the bar with a first-time strike.\n\n1st minute: The visitors get us underway.\n\n15 mins until kickoff: The teams have headed down the tunnel here at the Theatre of Dreams and kickoff is next...\n\n30 mins until kickoff: The warm-ups are underway at Old Trafford on a chilly night. Ten Hag has just told MUTV that Chelsea do not \"like to defend\" and that United must take advantage of that this evening.\n\n45 mins until kickoff: Raheem Sterling has failed to score in any of his 24 matches against Man United. Could tonight be the ex-Liverpool and Man City player's night?\n\n1 hour until kickoff: Team news is in! The eyebrow-raising decision from Erik ten Hag is that Marcus Rashford starts from the bench. Mauricio Pochettino starts the former Man City man, Cole Palmer.\n\n1 hour 30 mins until kickoff: Chelsea have won three of their last four Premier League away games but are without a league win at Old Trafford since 2013...\n\n2 hours until kickoff: It's been a relatively busy start to the week off the pitch for Erik ten Hag, it's time to see what happens on it.\n\n\"I had to set some standards\"\n\n\n\nErik ten Hag claims there was not a good culture among staff and players before he joined Man United \ud83d\ude2cpic.twitter.com/DJWe42mDXY \u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) December 5, 2023\n\nMan United vs Chelsea lineups\n\nMidfielder Casemiro and defender Lisandro Martinez remain out for Manchester United, while Christian Eriksen may not return in 2023.\n\nMason Mount missed United's defeat at Newcastle United on Saturday and Jonny Evans has not played for almost a month because of a thigh issue.

    "body": "Plucky little cranberries have grown for millennia amid sandy soils and short summers of southeastern Massachusetts and Cape Cod.\n\nThe Pilgrims explored and then settled this same area in 1620 \u2014 and celebrated the first Thanksgiving the following year.\n\n\"When the Pilgrims first set foot on Cape Cod, even before they saw Plymouth Rock, they may have well stepped on the American cranberry,\" Richard S. Cox and Jacob Walker write in their book, \"Massachusetts Cranberry Culture: A History from Bog to Table.\"\n\nTheir 2012 book is a romantic ode to the quirks of New England history, geography and culture \u2014 and of its low-growing fruit.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE THE NATION OUR THANKSGIVING ORIGIN STORY: PILGRIM EDWARD WINSLOW\n\nIt \"seems doubtful,\" however, that the Pilgrims even noticed the cranberries.\n\n\"For all its tasty charms, the cranberry is hardly the sort to attract attention,\" Cox and Walker say in their book.\n\nThe tart, colorful cranberry's native habitat around the Pilgrim settlement in Plymouth, and its ascension to a uniquely vibrant place on America\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner table, are something of a coincidence \u2014 and a 20th-century phenomenon.\n\nCredit cranberry king Marcus Urann, a true innovator of American agriculture.\n\n\"When the Pilgrims first set foot on Cape Cod \u2026 they may have well stepped on the American cranberry.\"\n\nUrann, most notably, invented cranberry sauce \u2014 at least the commercial canned cranberry jelly central to Thanksgiving celebrations nationwide today.\n\nThe bookish boy from Maine became an influential college scholar and then a Boston attorney before giving up the bar for the bogs.\n\nUrann purchased cranberry farms in Massachusetts early in the 20th century. He introduced a way to put cranberries in a can in 1912.\n\nCranberries are one of the few fruits native to the northern United States. But they have only a brief autumn harvest from late September to early November and a short shelf life.\n\nFresh cranberries were known only in a few areas of the nation that possess the right combination of sandy soil, long summers days and long winter dormancy.\n\nSEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN ON THANKSGIVING BLESSINGS, INCLUDING FAMILY, FOOD, COUNTRY: \u2018TIME TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE\u2019\n\nUrann turned this hyper-local fruit into an international industry \u2014 and changed the flavor of gratitude in the United States.\n\n\"Marcus Urann was very influential in expanding the cranberry market,\" Brian Wick, executive director of Massachusetts Cranberries, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"And that influence is still felt today.\"\n\nHis influence is also felt today far from the soil and of the cranberry bog \u2014 in the halls of American academia.\n\n\u2018Let the love of learning rule humanity\u2019\n\nMarcus Libby Urann was born on Oct. 3, 1873, to Marcus M. and Chestina Urann in Sullivan, Maine, a tiny Downeast town on Bar Harbor.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE AMERICAN LEGION, THEODORE ROOSEVELT, JR., PRIVILEGED TO FIGHT AND TO SERVE\n\nHe described himself as a \"bookworm\" in one letter. He attended the University of Maine, where he became an undergraduate scholar of great renown and great vision.\n\nHe was apparently aware of the gift of his intellect at a young age. He was also raised to believe, or grew to believe by college, that those born with great gifts were also born with great responsibility to the nation.\n\nHe founded a society of elite students at the University of Maine to charge the school's best and brightest with using their intellect for the wider good.\n\nIt's known today as Phi Kappa Phi, a nationwide honor society of the nation's best students.\n\n\"An analysis of the men in my class convinced me that some of our brightest men were in danger of contributing less to society \u2026 than their ability justified.\" \u2014 Marcus Urann\n\n\"Under the leadership of student Marcus L. Urann, who created the bylaws and constitution for the organization, the group formed the Lambda Sigma Eta Society,\" Phi Kappa Phi states today \u2014 recognizing Urann, more than 125 years later, as the father of the program while a student.\n\n\"Upon Urann's graduation, the school's president Abram Harris led the way for promoting the Society.\"\n\nHis society was renamed Phi Kappa Phi in 1900, from the letters of the Greek words forming its motto, Philosoph\u00eda Krate\u00edt\u00f5 Ph\u00f5t\u00f4n \u2013 \"Let the love of learning rule humanity.\"\n\n\u2018BEST HOMEMADE\u2019 THANKSGIVING TURKEY GRAVY THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL LOVE: TRY THE RECIPE\n\nThe group soon found advocates at Pennsylvania State College (now University) and the University of Tennessee, before spreading nationally and internationally.\n\nPhi Kappa Phi chapters are found at more than 325 campuses in the U.S. and at schools as far away as the Philippines.\n\nIt remains true to Urann's mission to \"engage the community of scholars in service to others.\"\n\n\"An analysis \u2026 of the men in my class convinced me that some of our brightest men were in danger of contributing less to society, to the university and to the state, than their ability justified us in expecting,\" Urann wrote of his endeavor in 1924.\n\n\"I wanted the ability of the high-rank man to be made most useful to society; also, I was looking for something which would be an inspiration to all students to work for high rank and I believed that uniting those men who were interested would be helpful.\"\n\nUrann himself became an attorney in Boston after graduation. But in 1906, he decided to give it up to buy cranberry bogs in and around Cape Cod and Plymouth.\n\n'Simple, insignificant-looking plant\u2019\n\nPilgrim Edward Winslow provided our only contemporary account of the first Thanksgiving. He mentions only fowl and deer, and \"our harvest being gotten in.\"\n\nThe harvest certainly included corn, scholars believe.\n\nThe rest of the \"harvest\" upon which they feasted is unknown.\n\n\"But there is no evidence the Pilgrims had cranberries at the first Thanksgiving,\" said Wick of Massachusetts Cranberries, despite the fact they are one of the few fruits native to North America that grow in the northern United States.\n\nIt might have just been overlooked \u2014 as authors Cox and Walker suspect.\n\n\"There is no evidence the Pilgrims had cranberries at the first Thanksgiving.\" \u2014 Brian Wick\n\nThey cite colonial settler John Josselyn, who wrote in 1672 that the cranberry is nothing but \"a small trailing plant\" and a humble vine \"that grows over Salt Marshes that are overgrown with moss.\"\n\nBenjamin Eastwood, touted by Cox and Walker as one of the cranberry\u2019s \"greatest promoters,\" spoke only in humble terms of his beloved fruit.\n\nHe called the cranberry a \"simple, insignificant-looking plant\" and a \"stunted barren thing.\"\n\nUrann saw the cranberry differently. He saw a global industry crawling along the bogs of Massachusetts.\n\n\"After he set up cooking facilities at a packinghouse in Hanson, Massachusetts, he began to consider ways to extend the short selling season of the berries,\" Smithsonian Magazine reported in a 2013 history of cranberries.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE SHOPPING CART, SYLVAN GOLDMAN, OKLAHOMA SUPERMARKET MOGUL\n\n\"Canning them, in particular, he knew would make the berry a year-round product.\"\n\nIn 1912, Urann began processing gelled cranberries in cans \u2014 cranberry sauce.\n\n\"As modest as this seems, Urann's maneuver was revolutionary,\" write Cox and Walker. \"For a fruit that had been marketed almost exclusively as a fresh product, it was a radical proposal to cook and to can.\"\n\nMost importantly, cranberries could now be sold to consumers far from where they were grown.\n\nUrann pioneered other innovations in cranberry farming, too, including the process of wet-harvesting cranberries.\n\n\"For a fruit that had been marketed almost exclusively as a fresh product, it was a radical proposal to cook and to can.\"\n\nThe tiny berries were usually plucked from dried vines by migrant workers. But cranberries, each filled with four chambers of air, float easily.\n\nUrann realized the bog could be floated, the berries agitated from their vines, and easily rounded up while floating in the water.\n\nUrann teamed up with fellow leaders of cranberry farming John Makepeace and Elizabeth Lee to create Ocean Spray, still headquartered in Massachusetts to this day.\n\nThe name is synonymous with cranberry juice and cranberry sauce.\n\nOcean Spray is one of the world's most successful farming cooperatives. It's helped spread cranberry farming around the country and around the world \u2014 and put cranberry juices and sauces in international markets.\n\nOcean Spray cranberry sauce remains its signature product. The company first sold its cranberry sauce nationally in 1941 \u2014 its ridged cranberry gel a familiar site on Thanksgiving tables around the United States.\n\n\u2018Everything in life is what you do for others'\n\nMarcus L. Libby died on April 1, 1963 in Hanson, Massachusetts, where he rests in a family plot in Fernhill Cemetery.\n\n\"I do believe that anyone can do anything that he really desires to accomplish,\" Urann wrote as a young man 1924, explaining the history of Phi Kappa Phi.\n\nHe lived by that example throughout his life.\n\n\"A recognized giant of the cranberry industry,\" The Boston Globe wrote in his April 4 obituary, dubbing Urann the \"Cranberry King.\"\n\n\"He bought his first cranberry bog on [Cape Cod] in 1906.

    "body": "Cranberries, a recent addition to agriculture, were domesticated around 200 years ago in the U.S.\n\nCranberries are a staple in U.S. households at Thanksgiving \u2013 but how did this bog dweller end up on holiday tables?\n\nCompared to many valuable plant species that were domesticated over thousands of years, cultivated cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is a young agricultural crop, just as the U.S. is a young country and Thanksgiving is a relatively new holiday. But as a plant scientist, I\u2019ve learned much about cranberries\u2019 ancestry from their botany and genomics.\n\nThe Domestication of Cranberries\n\nHumans have cultivated sorghum for some 5,500 years, corn for around 8,700 years, and cotton for about 5,000 years. In contrast, cranberries were domesticated around 200 years ago \u2013 but people were eating the berries before that.\n\nWild cranberries are native to North America. They were an important food source for Native Americans, who used them in puddings, sauces, breads and a high-protein portable food called pemmican \u2013 a carnivore\u2019s version of an energy bar, made from a mixture of dried meat and rendered animal fat and sometimes studded with dried fruits. Some tribes still make pemmican today, and even market a commercial version.\n\nCranberry cultivation began in 1816 in Massachusetts, where Revolutionary War veteran Henry Hall found that covering cranberry bogs with sand fertilized the vines and retained water around their roots. From there, the fruit spread throughout the U.S. Northeast and Upper Midwest.\n\nToday, Wisconsin produces roughly 60% of the U.S. cranberry harvest, followed by Massachusetts, Oregon, and New Jersey. Cranberries also are grown in Canada, where they are a major fruit crop.\n\nBotanical Features of Cranberries\n\nCranberries have many interesting botanical features. Like roses, lilies and daffodils, cranberry flowers are hermaphroditic, which means they contain both male and female parts. This allows them to self-pollinate instead of relying on birds, insects or other pollinators.\n\nA cranberry blossom has four petals that peel back when the flower blooms. This exposes the anthers, which contain the plant\u2019s pollen. The flower\u2019s resemblance to the beak of a bird earned the cranberry its original name, the \u201ccraneberry.\u201d\n\nWhen cranberries don\u2019t self-pollinate, they rely on bumblebees and honeybees to transport their pollen from flower to flower. They can also be propagated sexually, by planting seeds, or asexually, through rooting vine cuttings. This is important for growers because seed-based propagation allows for higher genetic diversity, which can translate to things like increased disease resistance or more pest tolerance.\n\nAsexual reproduction is equally important, however. This method allows growers to create clones of varieties that perform very well in their bogs and grow even more of those high-performing types.\n\nEvery cranberry contains four air pockets, which is why they float when farmers flood bogs to harvest them. The air pockets also make raw cranberries bounce when they are dropped on a hard surface \u2013 a good indicator of whether they are fresh.\n\nThese pockets serve a biological role: They enable the berries to float down rivers and streams to disperse their seeds. Many other plants disperse their seeds via animals and birds that eat their fruits and excrete the seeds as they move around. But as anyone who has tasted them raw knows, cranberries are ultra-tart, so they have limited appeal for wildlife.\n\nGenetic Insights and Breeding\n\nFor cranberries being such a young crop, scientists already know a lot about their genetics. The cranberry is a diploid, which means that each cell contains one set of chromosomes from the maternal parent and one set from the paternal parent. It has 24 chromosomes, and its genome size is less than one-tenth that of the human genome.\n\nInsights like these help scientists better understand where potentially valuable genes might be located in the cranberry genome. And diploid crops tend to have fewer genes associated with a single trait, which makes breeding them to emphasize that trait much simpler.\n\nResearchers have also described the genetics of the cultivated cranberry\u2019s wild relative, which is known as the \u201csmall cranberry\u201d (Vaccinium oxycoccos). Comparing the two can help scientists determine where the cultivated cranberry\u2019s agronomically valuable traits reside in its genome, and where some of the small cranberry\u2019s cold hardiness might come from.\n\nResearchers are developing molecular markers \u2013 tools to determine where certain genes or sequences of interest reside within a genome \u2013 to help determine the best combinations of genes from different varieties of cranberry that can enhance desired traits. For example, a breeder might want to make the fruits larger, more firm or redder in color.\n\nWhile cranberries have only been grown by humans for a short period of time, they have been evolving for much longer. They entered agriculture with a long genetic history, including things like whole genome duplication events and genetic bottlenecks, which collectively change which genes are gained or lost over time in a population.\n\nWhole genome duplication events occur when two species\u2019 genomes collide to form a new, larger genome, encompassing all the traits of the two parental species. Genetic bottlenecks occur when a population is greatly reduced in size, which limits the amount of genetic diversity in that species. These events are extremely common in the plant world and can lead to both gains and losses of different genes.\n\nAnalyzing the cranberry\u2019s genome can indicate when it diverged evolutionarily from some of its relatives, such as the blueberry, lingonberry, and huckleberry. Understanding how modern species evolved can teach plant scientists about how different traits are inherited, and how to effectively breed for them in the future.\n\nCranberries and Thanksgiving\n\nCranberries\u2019 close association with Thanksgiving was simply a practical matter at first. Fresh cranberries are ready to harvest from mid-September through mid-November, so Thanksgiving falls within that perfect window for eating them.\n\nCranberry sauce was first loosely described in accounts from the American colonies in the 1600s and appeared in a cookbook for the first time in 1796. The berries\u2019 tart flavor, which comes from high levels of several types of acids, makes them more than twice as acidic as most other edible fruits, so they add a welcome zing to a meal full of blander foods like turkey and potatoes.\n\nIn recent decades, the cranberry industry has branched out into juices, snacks, and other products in pursuit of year-round markets. But for many people, Thanksgiving is still the time when they\u2019re most likely to see cranberries in some form on the menu.\n\nWritten by Serina DeSalvio, Ph.D. Candidate in Genetics and Genomics, Texas A&M University.\n\nAdapted from an article originally published in The Conversation."

    "body": "England\u2019s hopes of defending their World Cup crown are in tatters \u2013 and we\u2019re barely halfway through the 2023 tournament.\n\nSecond-last of ten on the table after a fourth abject loss in barely three weeks, this time by eight wickets and nearly 25 overs to spare against Sri Lanka having been bowled out for a miserable 156 in Bengaluru, the 2019 champions are now only mathematically a chance of scraping through to the semi-finals.\n\nThey need not only to somehow turn their horrendous form around to win all four of their remaining matches, including an upcoming date with table-toppers and tournament favourites India, but also to hope numerous other results, including Australia to lose at least two and probably three of its own four games, to reach the knockout stage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nAs expected, the reaction from the UK, and from a swathe of English cricket greats, was scathing.\n\nLeading the charge was the always outspoken Sir Geoff Boycott, who wrote in The Telegraph that the team were paying the price for poor preparation in the lead-up to the World Cup, as well as shoddy team selection extending back to The Ashes earlier this year.\n\n\u201cIt is an old saying: \u201cBy failing to prepare, you prepare to fail\u201d,\u201d Boycott wrote.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that England rarely bat well in India where the ball spins. Our guys are okay on flat pitches but if it turns they have a problem.\n\n\u201cSo the best way to try and overcome that would have been for our squad of players to get to India early and play four or five warm-up matches. What did England do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlan only two warm-up games with one getting rained off. Not smart planning\u2026 batting and bowling against stiff opponents sharpens your game and puts you on your mettle. Against Sri Lanka, they were once again exposed.\n\n\u201cToo many of our guys just want to play crash, bang wallop all the time irrespective of the type of pitch or opposition. Again not smart.\u201d\n\nThe brunt of Boycott\u2019s criticism of England\u2019s team composition was directed at the continued struggles of Jonny Bairstow, who has averaged just 25.2 this tournament, and all-rounder Chris Woakes, whose nightmare campaign continued against Sri Lanka with figures of 0/30 from six overs and a fourth-ball duck.\n\n\u201cBairstow has struggled since his horrific injury [breaking his leg 12 months ago],\u201d Boycott wrote.\n\n\u201cI have said before I believe Jonny came back too soon and was short of fitness and match practice. In the recent five Ashes Tests his keeping at Lord\u2019s was poor with missed chances and he made only three significant batting scores out of nine innings. That shortage of runs has carried over to his patchy one day performances.\n\n\u201cChris Woakes is an excellent bowler of swing and seam on English type pitches. His record abroad is poor as he does not have the pace or guile for flat batting surfaces. It is not the lad\u2019s fault. He was selected but how could people picking the squad go against all the statistics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Boycott isn\u2019t blaming captain Jos Buttler for the team\u2019s woes, saying the skipper has an impossible job pulling together a \u2018dysfunctional squad of players\u2019 and that not even a \u2018miracle man\u2019 would have much of a prayer of salvaging any pride from the wreckage in India.\n\n\u201cToo many people are criticising the captaincy of Buttler and judging him against the captaincy of Eoin Morgan when England won the World Cup four years ago,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMorgan\u2019s England team was a finely tuned machine with everyone knowing their role and most of them at the top of their form\u2026 all Morgan had to do was pull the strings of a great unit of cricketers and he did it well, but my Mum could have captained that lot.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand Jos has a dysfunctional squad of players. Poorly selected, poorly prepared, not a settled team, many not sure of their roles, patchy form, confidence wobbly and to cap it all England\u2019s best two and most influential white-ball players have not been available.\u201d\n\nBoycott\u2019s voice was added to by former England Test captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton, who have both decried the sudden decline of the team\u2019s previously dominant white-ball set-up, having entered the World Cup as reigning ODI and T20I champions.\n\nHussain said post-match on Sky Sports that \u201cback to back, I\u2019ve not seen England play as badly as that\u201d, adding that the team\u2019s issues are less to do with the frequently-criticised The Hundred or a lack of 50-over cricket in the build-up to the tournament as it is the sudden and collective loss of form of the English batting order.\n\n\u201cIf you walk in that dressing room now and asked them to put their hand on their heart and say, are you in good nick? I reckon maybe one or two could say that,\u201d Hussain said, later doubling down with a scathing editorial in the Daily Mail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have all collapsed as a unit and their form has deserted them. Compare that to South Africa and their batting lineup, everyone\u2019s in nick. You look at India and their batting lineup, Rohit [Sharma], KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill \u2013 all in nick.\n\n\u201cSome of those cricketers on that park today would go in your best ever England white ball XI. It\u2019s just been a bridge too far for most of them.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is giving players a cop out\u2026 when we win the 50-over World Cup and the 20-over World Cup, aren\u2019t they great? We\u2019re brilliant. And when the wheels come of it\u2019s the structure. It\u2019s the structure of English cricket, we\u2019re a disgrace.\n\n\u201cWe play 20-over cricket, we play 100-ball cricket, we don\u2019t play enough 50-over cricket \u2013 how much 50-over cricket domestically has Virat Kohli played? Or Heinrich Klaasen or anyone out here?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s made this great side over the last six years, travelling round the world playing T20 franchises. It\u2019s such a lame excuse.\u201d\n\nAtherton described the England players as looking \u2018dazed and shell-shocked, unable to comprehend what has befallen them\u2019, and wrote in The Times that the Sri Lankan defeat officially represented the \u2018end of an era\u2019 for English white-ball supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEach defeat, now four in five matches, has chipped away at the confidence of a group of players at the end of a cycle,\u201d Atherton wrote.\n\n\u201cNo batsman looks in any kind of form. Every player has been used; some discarded and used again. They lost faith in their all-rounder strategy before the South Africa match, making three changes, and then went back to it here, making three more.\n\n\u201cPlayers sense uncertainty in decision-making \u2013 and there has been a lot of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to think that they could put in a worse performance than in Mumbai but they managed it with the bat in Bengaluru.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after the match, Buttler admitted his team had been \u2018short of our best by a very long way\u2019, saying there is \u2018no clear answer\u2019 as to how to turn their fortunes around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly tough, an incredibly disappointing tournament. As captain, you feel that a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been short of our best by a very long way. I\u2019m disappointed for myself and the boys that we\u2019ve not given a good account of ourselves\u2026 if there was one golden nugget that we\u2019re not doing then we\u2019d pick that up.\u201d\n\nSports opinion delivered daily\n\nEngland\u2019s tournament may only stay mathematically alive until Sunday evening (AEST), when they face the daunting challenge of tournament hosts India in Lucknow, with defeat certain to end their semi-final chances for good."

Most tons in World Cup so far\n\n1987 Reliance Cup, against England\n\nFour years later, the World Cup was being played outside England for the first time, and it was India which was hosting it.\n\nIn a co-incidence, India was against England in the semi-finals once again, at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, on November 5.\n\nThis time, England's Man-of-the-Match skipper Graham Gooch smashed 115 runs in 136 balls to lay a solid foundation for his team's fighting total of 254 for 6 wickets.\n\nIndia, one of the favourites to win the World Cup, were very much on the path to victory till Mohammad Azharuddin, who top-scored with 64 runs was at the crease.\n\nBut with the fall of his wicket, the Indian lower order collapsed like a house of placards as India lost the match by 35 runs.\n\n1996 Wills World Cup, against Sri Lanka\n\nThe 1996 Cricket World Cup is known for Sri Lanka's emergence as a cricketing power on the horizon of world cricket and the beginning of Sachin Tendulkar's extraordinary dominance in batting history.\n\nPlaying in the first semi-final at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on March 13, India were favourites again, and they raised their hopes when they managed to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 for 8 in 50 overs despite Man-of-the-Match Aravinda de Silva's 66 and Roshan Mahanama's 58.\n\nIndia seamer Javagal Srinath took three top-order wickets, including Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana.\n\nFans at the Eden Garden were cheering loudly till Tendulkar was at the crease.\n\nBut once he fell for 65 with the team at 98, India suffered one of the worst collapses in the batting history of the World Cups.\n\nThe crowd turned angry and hostile towards Sri Lanka, creating a ruckus at the stadium, and the match was interrupted.\n\nWith no respite from onlookers' side, umpires decided to call off the match when India were reeling at 120 for eight in 34.1 overs.\n\nThe long-lasting memories of the crowd's bad behaviour and a weeping Vinod Kambli returning to the pavilion are still fresh in the memories of the cricket fans of that generation.\n\n\n\n2003 World Cup, against Kenya\n\nIndia were playing underdogs Kenya in the last-four stage match in Durban on March 20.\n\nWith Man-of-the-Match India skipper Sourav Ganguly scoring an unbeaten 111 runs in 114 balls and Man-of-the-Tournament Tendulkar scoring an 111-ball 83, India comfortably scored 270 for four wickets in 50 overs.\n\nIn reply, Kenya were no match for Indian dominance, and barring their skipper Steve Tikolo, who top-scored with 56 runs, no Kenyan batsman could score more than 29 runs.\n\nWith Zaheer Khan taking 3 wickets in 9.2 overs for just 14 runs, India could easily beat Kenya by 91 runs.\n\nThough India breezed into semi-finals easily, the tournament is also remembered for Kenya's best run in the World Cup as the team from a country with limited cricket facilities and no proper grassroots structure could reach as far as semi-finals.\n\n\n\n2011 World Cup, against Pakistan\n\nFans from India and Pakistan wouldn't have expected a better occasion than a World Cup for the meeting of two teams.\n\nThe World Cup returned to India after 1996, and India and Pakistan were facing each other in the second semi-final at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali on March 30.\n\nMan-of-the-Match Tendulkar rose to the occasion, scoring 85 runs for India.\n\nVirender Sehwag scored 38 while Suresh Raina remained unbeaten on 36 as India scored 260 for 9 in 50 overs.\n\nPakistan seamer Wahab Riaz took 5 for 46 in 10 overs. In reply, Pakistan batsmen Misbah-ul-Haq (56 runs) and Mohammad Hafeez (43 runs) showed some resistance from Pakistan, but in lack of a big innings lower down the order hit Pakistan's prospects badly as they were all out for 231 runs in 49.5 overs.\n\nIndia moved to finals and beat Sri Lanka to win their second World Cup title.\n\n\n\n2015 World Cup, against Australia\n\nIndia were playing against Australia in the second semi-final of the 2015 World Cup in Sydney on March 26. Australia outplayed India in almost all departments of the game.\n\nAustralian Man-of-the-Match Steve Smith (105 runs in 93 balls) and Aaron Finch (81 runs in 116 balls) were the guiding forces in taking Australia to 328 runs for 7 wickets in 50 overs.\n\nIn reply, India needed a few big innings, but apart from skipper MS Dhoni (65 runs in 65 balls), Shikhar Dhawan (45 runs in 34 balls), and Ajinkya Rahane (44 runs in 68 balls), the batting order collapsed miserably as India lost the match by 95 runs.\n\n\n\n2019 World Cup, against New Zealand\n\nThe cricket World Cup returned to England for the fifth time.\n\nIndia were playing their sixth semi-finals at a place where they played their first World Cup semi-final in 1983, Manchester. However, with a different team- New Zealand.\n\nIndian bowlers raised hopes when they restricted New Zealand to 239 for 8 in 50 overs with Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking three wickets.\n\nRoss Taylor 74 runs (90 balls) and skipper Kane Willamson 67 runs (95 balls) were the top scorers for New Zealand. But Kiwi Man-of-the-Match bowler Matt Henry sent openers KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma back to the pavilion soon, followed by the dismissal of Dinesh Karthik in the 10th over of India's innings.\n\nWith the Indian top-order failing, Ravindra Jadeja (77 runs in 59 balls) and wicketkeeper MS Dhoni (50 runs in 72 balls) tried to steady the Indian ship.\n\nBut once they fell, it was all over for India as they lost the battle by 18 runs.\n\n2023 World Cup, against New Zealand\n\nTo be played"

For some, the belief that Mossad was among the best in the spying world was shattered today when Hamas carried out the biggest coordinated attack in Israel and captured some territory in southern Israel.

    "body": "International aid groups are warning that they cannot deliver food and other basic services to people in the Gaza Strip and that a \u201cdire\u201d humanitarian crisis is set to worsen.\n\nInternational aid groups provide food and other means of support to about 63% of people in Gaza.\n\nIsrael stopped allowing deliveries of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million residents on Oct. 10, 2023, and is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2023, Israel warned 1.1 million Gaza residents in the northern section of the enclave to leave for the southern region, in advance of a potential ground invasion.\n\nI am a scholar of peace and conflict economics and a former World Bank consultant, including during the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel.\n\nInternational aid groups now face the same problem in Gaza that local businesses and residents have encountered for about 16 years: a blockade that prevents civilians and items, like medicine from easily moving into or out of the enclosed area, roughly 25 miles long. That 16-year blockade did not apply to the food and fuel that groups brought in to Gaza.\n\nNow, it does.\n\nGaza\u2019s blockade and economy\n\nGaza is about the size of Philadelphia and requires trade with different businesses and countries in order to maintain and grow its economy.\n\nBut Gaza is heavily dependent on foreign aid.\n\nThis is partially the result of Israel setting up permanent air, land and sea blockades around Gaza in 2007, one year after Hamas rose to political power. Egypt, which borders Gaza on its southern end, also oversees one checkpoint that specifically limits people coming and going.\n\nWhile Israel has granted permits to about 17,000 Gaza residents to enter and work in Israel, the food, fuel and medical supplies that people in Gaza use all first pass through Israel.\n\nIsrael controls two physical checkpoints along Gaza, which monitor both the entry and exit of people and trucks. Israel limits the kind and quantity of materials that pass into Gaza. And the blockades generally prohibit Gazans who do not have work permits or special clearance \u2013 for medical purposes, for example \u2013 from entering Israel.\n\nIsrael\u2019s restrictions through the blockade intensified since Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on 20 Israeli towns and several military bases on Oct. 7, with Israel then announcing a broad blockade of imports into Gaza. This stopped all food, fuel and medical supplies from entering the region.\n\nGaza\u2019s isolation\n\nThe Palestinian enclaves of West Bank and Gaza \u2013 which are generally lumped together in economic analyses \u2013 both have small economies that run a massive deficit of US$6.6 billion in losses each year, as the value of the imports they receive greatly outweighs the value of the items they produce and sell elsewhere.\n\nMore than 53% of Gaza residents were considered below the poverty line in 2020, and about 77% of Gazan households receive some form of aid from the United Nations and other groups, mostly in the form of cash or food.\n\nGaza\u2019s weak economy is caused by a number of complex factors, but the largest is the blockade and the economic and trade isolation it creates.\n\nFor the average Gazan, the blockade has several practical effects, including people\u2019s ability to get food. About 64% of people in Gaza are considered food insecure, meaning they do not have reliable access to sufficient amounts of food.\n\nFood as a percentage of Gaza\u2019s total imports has skyrocketed by 50% since 2005, when Israel first imposed a temporary blockade. And the amount of food the West Bank and Gaza actually produce has tumbled by 30% since then.\n\nIt is hard for Gaza to produce food within its own borders. One factor is that Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza\u2019s only power generation plant and main sewage treatment plant in 2008 and again in 2018. These attacks resulted in the spread of sewage waste on land and in the water, destroying farmlands and food crops and threatening fish stocks in the ocean as well.\n\nThe UN\u2019s big role in Gaza\n\nGaza\u2019s weak economy and isolation because of the blockade mean that it relies heavily on international aid organizations to provide basic services to residents. The biggest of these aid groups in Gaza is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \u2013 also known as UNRWA.\n\nToday, UNRWA is the second-largest employer in Gaza, following Hamas. It provides the bulk of the education, food aid and health care services for people in Gaza, in addition to 3 million other people registered as Palestinian refugees who live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and other places.\n\nOver time, UNRWA has evolved into a kind of parallel government, alongside Hamas, which Israel, the United States and other countries designate as a terrorist organization.\n\nUNRWA funds and runs a network of 284 schools in Gaza alone, employing over 9,000 local people as staff and educating over 294,000 children each year.\n\nUNRWA runs 22 hospitals in Gaza that employ almost 1,000 health staff and has 3.3 million patient visits per year.\n\nIts schools are converted into humanitarian shelters in times of crisis, such as the current war. People can go there to get clean water, food, mattresses and blankets, showers and more.\n\nThe number of people in Gaza who are displaced from their homes has quickly risen over the last few days, totaling over 330,000 on Oct. 12, 2023. Over two-thirds of these people are staying in UNRWA schools.\n\nA complicated US relationship\n\nThe U.S. has historically been the single-largest funder of UNRWA, a U.N. agency that relies on governments to support its work. The U.S. gave more than $500 million to Palestinians from April 2021 through March 2022, including more than $417 million that went to UNRWA.\n\nU.S. support to UNRWA has fluctuated throughout different presidential administrations.\n\nTotal U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza peaked at $1 billion in 2009 \u2013 after Israel sealed off the territory. It reached $1 billion in annual contributions again in 2013, when former Secretary of State John Kerry helped restart peace talks between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn 2018, the Trump Administration cut almost all of the money the U.S. typically gives to UNRWA, amounting to roughly 30% of the organization\u2019s total budget.\n\nDefenders of the policy change cited UNRWA-published textbooks that allegedly glorified jihad. UNRWA, for its part, maintained that, as an outside organization, it can only use the educational materials the country it is working in wants.\n\nThe Biden administration then restored funding to UNRWA and other organizations helping Palestinians in 2021.\n\nSome Republican politicians have said that UNRWA has \u201ccozied up\u201d to Hamas. And an internal UNRWA ethics committee has accused top staff at the agency of \u201csexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation \u2026 and other abuses of authority\u201d that created a toxic work environment.\n\nMeanwhile, since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 8, more than 1,500 Gazans have been killed and more than 5,300 injured, while Hamas attacks have killed more than 1,300 people in Israel and injured about 3,200 others.\n\nInternational aid groups and European Union officials have called for a humanitarian corridor to be set up in Gaza \u2013 meaning a protected path specifically for civilians, aid workers and necessary basic items to pass through safely back and forth from Gaza to Israel and Egypt. So far, there are no clear plans for such a protected pathway.\n\nTopher L.

Harassing notifications pop up all around the phone and the figure breaths very slowly.\n\nikeLike many instructors, Janani Umamaheswar occasionally checks Rate My Professors to monitor her course reviews. The site offers a loose barometer of how you are doing as a teacher, especially early in a career in academia. Since users post anonymously, including criticisms and rants, the site can also become a fount of anxiety. When negative reviews do appear, any professor might speculate: How often are people checking my page? Could this reflect poorly on my future employment? And in particular, who posted the criticism? They might run down the mental list of students who received low grades or did not get a requested extension or rarely spoke in class. They might wonder if a user is even a former student or if they ever took their class at all. After all, the anonymous nature of Rate My Professors means there is no surefire way to verify or screen people who write reviews. Until 2019, most comments under Umamaheswar\u2019s profile on the site had been positive. Or at least constructive. She had been on a tenure track for four years at her previous university. But that winter, Umamaheswar, then an assistant professor in sociology at Southern Connecticut State University, began noticing strange remarks: \u201cTextbook only discusses crimes of the poor. I get discriminated against all semester. I felt like I was in Germany in the 1930s with my grandparents,\u201d read one, with a class rating of \u201cawful\u201d and a score of one out of five. More comments followed into early 2020: \u201cThis is the worst professor I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Some reviews on her profile seemed particularly off-kilter: One claimed that Umamaheswar had been dishonest about going to school in Canada. (She completed her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees at the University of Toronto.) Another alleged that Umamaheswar had a \u201ctyrannical authoritarian ideology\u201d and accused her of \u201cdiscrimination against students with prior substance abuse histories.\u201d (She had no idea what this referred to, and as a woman of color, she made intentional efforts to make her classrooms feel safe and inclusive.) Umamaheswar showed the posts to her husband, Alex Sinha, who at the time was a law professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, where they both lived. He suggested she contact Rate My Professors to remove them. They assumed the company complied. But a short time later, comments in the same tone resurfaced under a new class code. Umamaheswar reached out to Rate My Professors again. Weeks passed. More posts emerged. An earlier one read: \u201cEmailed me a bribe offering a grade boost if I did her a favor of attending a meeting she was hosting. I did not respond because accepting a bribe is illegal.\u201d Umamaheswar and Sinha could not figure out who might be posting them. Umamaheswar had obviously never bribed any students. Someone was inventing specific defamatory accusations about her behavior. But who? One day, Umamaheswar opened a report from her web hosting company, which logged the IP addresses that had visited her professional website. It was a lightly trafficked portfolio with her CV and academic papers. Visitors might stop by once and maybe return weeks later. But one local address began showing up, repeatedly, at all hours of the day, into the night, again the next morning. Sometimes, the same IP showed up in over two dozen hits an hour. She and her husband wondered: could it be the same user from Rate My Professors? Sinha then checked his personal website and grew even more alarmed. The same IP address had also been visiting his pages frequently, lingering on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and published writing. Then, in December, police from Southern Connecticut State University contacted Umamaheswar\u2019s department. The chair called Umamaheswar to inform her that a student had filed a police report against her and two other professors on campus. The report noted that she contacted police \u201cregarding a possible hacking of her personal laptop computer which she stated was perpetrated by three faculty members of the Sociology Department,\u201d including Umamaheswar. The student had taken classes with each of the three professors and also accused them \u201cof using students in the class to follow her around and look at her papers which has made her extremely uncomfortable and feel unsafe.\u201d The police report also referred to the student by name. Here, we\u2019ll just refer to her as S. Umamaheswar remembered S., the mild and unobtrusive student, a young white woman, from one of her classes. When a police investigator contacted Umamaheswar, she told them about the mysterious Rate My Professors posts. It turned out S. had also emailed accusations about Umamaheswar to Southern Connecticut State school officials. As far as she knew, the complaint had gone up to the president of the school and to the Title IX office, which handles discrimination and harassment complaints, including sexual harassment and misconduct. In one message to administration on February 9th, 2020, S. wrote: \u201cI genuinely believe Dr. Umamaheswar is a danger to other students as she was to me.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cShe is a pathological liar and capable of twisting words to get what she wants.\u201d The accusations, like the Rate My Professors posts, were baseless. But they blindsided Umamaheswar anyway. As the news sunk in, Umamaheswar and Sinha learned that the other two accused professors from Southern Connecticut had separately filed police reports against S. for harassment. Umamaheswar decided against doing so herself. She was, after all, a professor who studied the law, social inequality, and incarceration. To her, this was probably someone struggling with mental health issues, and Umamaheswar knew how the legal system might treat her. Instead of seeking punishment, she just hoped the situation would just go away. Southern Connecticut State administrators from four separate university offices investigated the allegations and harassment claims involving all of the professors, as did the police department. After two trying months, they dismissed S.\u2019s claims about Umamaheswar, deeming them \u201cfactually incorrect, disparaging\u201d and \u201clegally actionable.\u201d A relief. School administrators sent S. a cease and desist letter and banned her from the university. \u201cShould you decide to violate either of these directives, you will subject yourself to arrest and prosecution,\u201d the assistant dean of students wrote in a letter to S. on February 9th, 2020. Shortly after, law enforcement arrested S. for harassment. She was later released, awaiting a court date. At first, law enforcement seemed concerned about S.\u2019s behavior. Police issued alerts about S. and offered to relocate professors to an area of the school that had more security and locked doors. At one point, officers offered to install a panic button inside of Umamaheswar\u2019s office. This did little to soothe Sinha\u2019s worries about his wife and their children\u2019s safety. As police seemed to take the situation more seriously, it made him even more cautious. He installed a security camera at home. A month later, the pandemic shut down college campuses, and classes shifted online. S. seemed to quiet, too. A year passed. Umamaheswar accepted a job as an assistant professor at George Mason University, and the family moved to Virginia. Sinha would continue to teach remotely, later commuting to teach at Hofstra University on Long Island. For the next year, they did not hear of any other letters or harassing emails from S. As far as they knew, they were moving past it all. One afternoon in March of 2022, the couple was at home in Virginia when Umamaheswar received a text from a former colleague who was now teaching sociology at Vassar College. The professor had noticed a strange, hidden comment on her Twitter account. When she clicked through, she saw a name she\u2019d heard about before \u2014 when her colleagues at Southern Connecticut State were being harassed two years earlier. S. was back.\n\nLoading . . .\n\ntudentsStudents are historically the most vulnerable populations at risk of being stalked on college campuses. In one study across eight universities in the southwest, 17 percent of students reported being stalked since enrolling in college, with women, transgender or gender-nonconforming and sexual minority students more likely to be victims. The students reported being targeted by strangers, acquaintances, friends, former partners, other classmates, and non-students. A college campus can be a first grasp of adulthood for many, the place where they learn who they are in the world or experiment with relationships, romance, and drugs or alcohol. It can also be a place with clear power imbalances. Many college protective measures have arisen in response to inappropriate relationships between students and teachers. In some cases, professors have become harassers. There are extreme examples. In her 2019 memoir, Consent: A Memoir of Unwanted Attention, Donna Freitas detailed her two-year ordeal of being stalked by her professor, who showed up unsolicited to her apartment and wrote her a stream of letters and emails. And at the University of Central Florida, a professor was arrested after sending a student over 800 messages a day, including one that read: \u201cYou should be happy that someone likes you this much to stalk you.\u201d But today, a cadre of academics is now aiming to strengthen the much smaller body of research that exists around faculty who experience stalking and abuse. Victoria O\u2019Meara, a post-doctoral research fellow at Royal Roads University, has been interviewing scholars in the US and Canada for a study on online abuse of faculty. She told me there has been \u201can increasingly organized attack on academia,\u201d and scholars have told her their universities remain ill-equipped to respond to it or support faculty, let alone to protect them. Concerns about professors being stalked or harmed on campuses are evolving and becoming more amorphous with online threats, but they are not new: In 2002, three nursing professors at the University of Arizona were killed by a student who had harassed and stalked them for a year. Four years later, a student at Loyola University spent a year making harassing phone calls to a professor before attempting to burn down his house. A University of Southern California psychology professor was stabbed to death on campus in 2016 by a student, despite warnings to police and university administrators of threats made by the same person over a year prior. And in 2022, at the University of Arizona, an expelled student shot a professor, killing him. In the months before the murder, various faculty members had reported a history of threats, harassment, and abuse by the student to the university and police. Over the last two decades, US colleges and universities have emphasized policies to protect students. But some within academia are now calling on institutions to do more to defend professors and other staff, who are also commonly targeted. Today\u2019s academics have become public figures online and in the media in a climate of rising political polarization, racism and misogyny, and attacks on intellectualism. In the digital age, many threats to faculty and staff do not just come from those affiliated with campuses. They can come from individuals anywhere around the world, making harassers harder to track down or punish. Scholars now appear regularly in the press, maintain their own personal webpages, post regularly on social media, and are encouraged to write for broader audiences \u2014 these are now the expectations of a job once largely confined to their campus and field. The Professor Watchlist, launched in 2016, has grown to include the names of more than nearly 1,000 scholars to its original roster of 200 and includes Angela Davis, Ibram X. Kendi, and Noam Chomsky. The site regularly posts photos and information about those deemed as radical professors \u201cadvancing leftists propaganda in the classroom.\u201d In recent years, as attacks on critical race theory, Black history, and books or courses addressing gender identity have exploded across the country, many educators are feeling even more under scrutiny and at risk for extremist threats. Even for less famous academics, like Umamaheswar and Sinha, the very substance of their work already made them potential targets in this political climate. Umamaheswar\u2019s publications included research into \u201cpolicing and racial (in)justice in the media.\u201d Sinha\u2019s publications included titles on \u201cracial discrimination in the United States.\u201d The two of them had co-authored a paper together on wrongful imprisonment. Both come from South Asian backgrounds, and it was not lost on either of them that S. is white. Based on their own knowledge of the criminal justice system, it would not have been implausible for law enforcement to not take her behavior to be a serious threat in the first place. A 2009 study on student stalking of faculty in the Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning found that questions of whether professors are at risk of being stalked by their students had received little attention. Yet the 52 faculty members interviewed for the study reported 87 concerning incidents, ranging from repeated unwanted messages, following them around, obsessively watching them, sexually coercive behavior toward the faculty member, endangerment, threats, and attempts to harm or even kill them. Some academics interviewed for the study made comments like: a \u201cstudent would have to injure me to be taken off campus\u2026 someone has to get hurt before something is done.\u201d Another added: \u201cThere is a tendency to immediately take the student\u2019s side over the professor\u2026[the] professor has no rights in this process.\u201d Other faculty members failed to report the incidents at all, and some described feelings of embarrassment, helplessness, and a personal responsibility for the student\u2019s behavior. \u201cMade me question what I was doing to promote this,\u201d one faculty member told researchers. \u201cWhat would make them think they could do this to me?\u201d\n\nThe account had started posting in October of 2021. Seven months of tweets.\n\ninhaSinha had never met or taught S. He had never been employed on the same campus as his wife. Now, they resided over six hours away from S. As much as she was a harasser, she was also a stranger. Sinha wondered if he needed to look more closely into the Twitter account to better understand her. The couple discussed the tweet on their drive to a park where they often took walks. From the passenger seat, Umamaheswar looked up the Twitter account in question. She gasped. It took a moment to process: thousands of tweets had been posted under the S.\u2019s name. Most were racist, sexual, vulgar, and violent. Little of the ranting made sense. The user tweeted at all hours, sometimes nearly a hundred times a day. And the tweets seemed to focus solely on three people: Umamaheswar, Sinha, and the former colleague who alerted them to the account, the Vassar professor Catherine Tan. Tan, like Sinha, had never taught or met S. and did not know her personally. But Tan had published papers with Umamaheswar. The user behind this account had linked Tan back to her, likely through this academic work and their benign social media interactions. Anyone Umamaheswar collaborated with professionally or even interacted with online had become a potential target. The Twitter account with S.\u2019s name featured an image of a white woman\u2019s face, which was recognizable to Umamaheswar as the same person she once taught. The tweets frequently denigrated Umamaheswar, Sinha, and Tan for being Asian: \u201cFat Indian bitch,\u201d read one tweet, referencing Umamaheswar by her first name in another tweet that day. \u201cSquinty eyed retard with a cucktonut husband,\u201d read another, referencing Sinha. \u201cI like that alex is probably abusive to her,\u201d read one tweet. \u201cAnd all she has is Catherine to call her awesome. Live in hell bitch.\u201d Another read: \u201cI have super detailed deaths I like to think about them experiencing.\u201d When Umamaheswar and Sinha returned home from the park that day, Sinha told himself he needed to monitor this account closely. Screenshot everything. Head off any potential threats of danger. Umamaheswar did not want to keep looking at the comments. But logging on at home, Sinha studied them. He had to take a moment to collect himself. The graphic nature and racist sentiments sent a wave of fear and anger through Sinha\u2019s body. In the last year, a white man had murdered six Asian women in three Atlanta area spas, and anti-Asian hate crimes had increased by over 300 percent. \u201cThere was this moment of \u2018wow, this has been happening all this time?\u2019\u201d Sinha said. \u201cWe moved to another state. We\u2019ve been living our lives. We\u2019ve been raising our kids.\u201d Yet all the while, in the background, this person had been obsessing about them daily, writing hateful lies and threats. The account had started posting in October of 2021. Seven months of tweets. Sinha went to work capturing the images as Umamaheswar began writing letters to her current administration, as well as to Vassar on behalf of Tan, alerting them to her history with S. As Sinha began cataloging the online comments, he felt compelled to read every single one. And the tweets just kept coming. Almost every week, except for the periods when S. was suspended by Twitter before restarting under a new account. At least 40,000 tweets and counting, Sinha said. Some referred to him as a \u201cdirty Indian hacker.\u201d And: \u201cProbably called a dirty terrorist as a kid and lived up to it.\u201d One tweet from April 16th, 2022, read: \u201cYo someone literally has to get rid of this faggot alex. Who the fuck cares if he\u2019s got a brothel of Asian women ready to suck his dick.\u201d A month later, a post with an image of grisly murder in Game of Thrones and the words: \u201cA crown for a king. Don\u2019t we all just want to say goodbye to Alex.\u201d And: \u201cI would like for these professors to die.\u201d A dark realization came over Sinha: \u201cShe calls for people to murder us. She says that she wants me raped,\u201d Sinha told me. \u201cShe would pay money to watch us bleed to death.\u201d The tweets continued: \u201cI wanna be put in a situation where they\u2019re hanging off the side of a cliff about to fall to their deaths begging for mercy and I can step on their hands and say me first and then watch them fall to their deaths.\u201d \u201cI want them to suffer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I didn\u2019t respond to threats, they targeted my family.\u201d\n\nnIn 2011, citing the alarmingly high rates of rape on campuses, the Obama administration began calling for colleges and universities to investigate accusations of assault with greater urgency and rigor. Two years later, Obama signed the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, which strengthened civil rights under Title IX, the federal law enacted in 1972 to prohibit gender-based discrimination in educational institutions and programs. This move required institutions to use more stringent methods to investigate and make judgments and offered more guidelines for believing and supporting those who make allegations of rape, assault, or sexual harassment. Under the Trump administration, some of these policies were rolled back and changed, allowing accused individuals to receive more due process protections. Many universities have historically mishandled student allegations of rape and sexual misconduct on campus, and Title IX laws became a crucial tool in curbing discrimination and harassment against students and employees based on sex. But there have also been cases in which the federal law has been manipulated and weaponized against those on campuses who are from marginalized and vulnerable groups, including faculty. The saga of S. is far from an anomaly. Professor and journalist Sarah Viren detailed the false sexual harassment accusations against herself and her wife filed with the Title IX Office at Arizona State University. In a follow-up podcast, Viren delved into interviews with other academics who reached out to her after she shared her story, including that of a Mexican American professor who was accused of sleeping with students and another professor up for tenure who was accused of harassment by a student she had never met. In one glaring example, at least 20 people, many of them academics from various states and schools, said they were harassed, threatened, called racial slurs, and stalked by an individual who apparently has also threatened to throw acid, chop off hands, murder, and mutilate some of them. \u201cWe know that being openly queer, not white, a woman, among many other social positions can set one up for excess surveillance, for questioning,\u201d tweeted one of the academics who said she was stalked, Shantel Buggs, an assistant professor at Florida State University, whose research centers on culture, race and racism, gender, and work inequity in academia. Sociologist Victor Ray, an associate professor at the University of Iowa, tweeted about his experience and said he was stalked by the same individual. This person \u201chas harassed me and my family\u2014including death threats and lying about my background\u2014for years,\u201d Ray wrote. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t respond to threats, they targeted my family.\u201d He added: \u201cThey target marginalized scholars because marginalization makes support more difficult and isolates their targets. I\u2019m talking about this now because ignoring it hasn\u2019t worked. They are committed to violent harassment like it is their full-time job.\u201d Title IX, a well-intentioned Obama-era policy to protect students, has had unintended side effects. It has empowered victims of harassment and sexual violence but has also weakened due process. \u201cAn accusation against someone the systems we all live within already disadvantages,\u201d wrote Buggs, \u201ccan be ruinous.\u201d\n\nLoading . . .\n\ninhaSinha became obsessive. Not a week went by without him routinely checking tweets at night and again as soon as he woke up. \u201cIt has just become part of the rhythm of my day,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting at the bus stop for my kids to get off the bus, and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Okay, let me take out my phone and take screenshots.\u2019 Or I\u2019m at the airport waiting for my flight or at a restaurant waiting to pick up my food.\u201d He captured the images for legal reasons and also so his wife would not have to read them. \u201cOn one level, it has become so ordinary, just part of my day, to read her outrageous, racist views. But at the same time, it never stops being outrageous,\u201d he said. Sinha pulled back from using social media himself. He rarely tweeted anymore. Though S. had never acted on any of her outlandish threats, Sinha had no idea what she was capable of. What if the online trail led her to act on the threats? Sinha told himself he had a family to protect. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t see it, and I didn\u2019t prepare, and something happened,\u201d Sinha told me, \u201cI would never forgive myself.\u201d At one point, Sinha read a tweet that suggested their S. had been watching him and his wife in a public place. The comments described seeing them in a specific spot where the couple often took walks together. Over and over, Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan filed complaints with Twitter for online abuse. At first, according to Sinha, the company responded that S. had not violated Twitter policies. Tan\u2019s husband was especially persistent in filing complaints. One of S.\u2019s accounts would get banned, but then another under a new handle popped up in its place. The pattern repeated. The tweets kept coming, sometimes trickling over to other professors online. Sinha took a screenshot of a tweet from S. on November 9th, 2022 \u2014 this time made to an Asian American assistant professor of sociology who was then at the University of Chicago and who Tan follows on Twitter. It read: \u201cHey can you stop stalking and sexually harassing me on Twitter.\u201d A similar tweet from the same account showed up on the page of an Asian American astrophysicist, who Tan also follows on Twitter: \u201cHey l\u2019ve noticed your being really abusive to women you\u2019ve never met online. I don\u2019t know what happened to you growing up that made you think this is ok to do along with everything else you\u2019ve done. I looked into reporting you.\u201d Tan felt obligated to reach out to her Twitter mutual contacts and warn them about S., now seemingly hunting for other Asian American academics connected to her. Recently, Sinha co-authored a paper with a colleague from another university. \u201cWhen we were wrapping up the article, and we had been accepted for publication, we wanted to share the news on Twitter,\u201d he said. Sinha texted the professor. He felt duty bound to warn him. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance she\u2019s going to engage in some hostile way.\u201d Any colleague, collaborator, or friend that entered Sinha\u2019s orbit risked being targeted by S. Sinha continued to capture more of the tweets: \u201cReporting Asians for sexual harassment is a new hobby of mine.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re just racist Asian supremacists who stand with anyone and anything that even looks somewhat Asian and they don\u2019t like white women and will abuse white women in the name of Asian nationalism.\u201d \u201cSomeone needs to man the fuck up and tell these Asians to step down and stop abusing white women to assert their dominance they don\u2019t have in the real world.\u201d \u201cIf anyone thinks I wouldn\u2019t beat the living shit out of this Asian chick until it was hospitalized and I was arrested for assault well then you\u2019re delusional.\u201d Sinha noticed the violence in the tweets had escalated. This time, S. was making explicit threats to contact Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan\u2019s universities. Southern Connecticut State University officials and police had already dealt with S. before, and there were receipts to prove it. Strangely, S. had even posted on social media an email she had received from Detective William S. Rivera from Southern Connecticut State University Police, along with his phone number. But officials at Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan\u2019s new institutions did not have a long history or record of all the issues they had dealt with in the past. The burden of evidence \u2014 to alert new or prospective employers or to warn colleagues and social media friends about their potential stalker \u2014 would fall on them for as long as S. is allowed to keep stalking and harassing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to upset my employer,\u201d said Sinha, who does not yet have tenure. In an environment where academic positions are scarce and competitive, he can\u2019t help but wonder how the whiff of an accusation or the presence of a stalker might tip the scales in a job interview or performance process. It makes Sinha anxious. \u201cThis has been hanging around my neck now for a while,\u201d he said. Sinha knows he has to be proactive from now on. \u201cI should get out in front of it.\u201d At this point, the tweets were coming by the minute, this time from the account @janedoepow: \u201dI want to report them to their schools for online sexual abuse and harassment. I\u2019m thinking about emailing the schools.\u201d \u201cAnd when they get confronted by their employers they\u2019re going to get so anxious and start making up excuses to try to cover their asses and we\u2019ll all see the kind of person they are.\u201d \u201cTime to start praying the universities view your work as more important than addressing a sexual harassment accusations report.\u201d \u201dVassars going to get an email.\u201d \u201dGMU will get an email\u2026\u201d Sinha told his wife. He also alerted Tan. All three of them would need to notify their department chairs and administrations at Hofstra, George Mason, and Vassar about S. and any potential false allegations that may be headed their way.\n\nThe internet has amplified so much of this behavior, making it easier for someone to become a stalker and easier for anyone to be stalked.\n\ntIt turned out Twitter was not the only place where S. was writing. Comments extended to Instagram and Facebook, where some of S.\u2019s friends supported her online, commenting or liking her posts. On February 23rd, 2020, S. wrote on Facebook: \u201cI filed a report that I was being harassed, stalked, defamed and studied by my professor and all I got was a joke of an investigation and this stupid legal warning.\u201d She continued: \u201cThe university is gaslighting me. Most of the officials I dealt with did NOT follow proper Title IX policy procedure throughout the process and has consequently made my experience much worse.\u201d S. also posted the cease and desist letter that had been sent to her. She received a response to the post from a graduate student at Rutgers University School of Social Work who specializes in violence against women and children and founded a Students Against Sexual Violence club on her campus: \u201cI work for an organization called Know Your IX. We do work around Title IX and I\u2019ve gone through the Title IX process at my school as well. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this treatment from your school.\u201d One Twitter post showed a screenshot of a conversation with someone who appeared to be a friend of S.\u2019s and seemed concerned: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too blunt but I promise I\u2019m saying this out of love and concern and not meanness. I think your mind is playing tricks on you\u2026And it\u2019s not like I think you\u2019re crazy because when I spend time with you you\u2019re totally normal and you\u2019re you. But specifically this ordeal seems crazy. It worries me\u2026 I honestly don\u2019t see what you\u2019re talking about. All I see is mundane posts.\u201d By November 2022, just as Sinha had predicted after monitoring her tweet storm, S.\u2019s letters arrived at the Title IX offices of Vassar and George Mason, though Sinha\u2019s campus, Hofstra, did not receive anything, as far as he knows. Ever since Tan warned Vassar about S. earlier that spring, school officials had blocked her email in the system. Still, Tan had reached out to her department head and the campus investigator again: \u201cYou might get something from her in the next couple of days. Be on the lookout for it.\u201d S. managed to circumvent Vassar\u2019s digital barriers using the online form on the school\u2019s Title IX page. Tan, who received a copy of the email, explained: \u201cShe wrote this long letter accusing me of sexually harassing her, forcing her to be a lesbian.\u201d S. signed with her full name. A similar email also arrived at the Title IX office of George Mason University: \u201cMy name is [S.] and I\u2019m not a student nor have I ever been one at George Mason. I\u2019m writing to you today regarding one of your employees, Janani Umamaheswar of criminology, at the university and their sexually harassing behavior towards me online on twitter.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cShe has called me a lesbian, and has recommended that I have sexual relationships with women.\u201d So far, the Title IX offices, departments, and administrators at Tan, Umamaheswar, and Sinha\u2019s schools have been responsive and understanding about their experiences with their harassment. But all three professors also know the potential threats reach beyond their campuses. The internet has amplified so much of this behavior, making it easier for someone to become a stalker and easier for anyone to be stalked.\n\norFor Catherine Tan, this experience of being, in a sense, a collateral victim of a cyberstalker who started out obsessed with someone else went from irritating to infuriating. Sometimes, the racial taunting especially hits a nerve. \u201cI\u2019m Vietnamese. I was born in the US,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cGrowing up in the \u201990s and early 2000s, at that time, American culture wasn\u2019t as welcoming.\u201d Some of S.\u2019s comments would claim Tan \u201cwants to be white.\u201d Tan told me she does not want to be white, but she did struggle to embrace her Asian American identity in her younger years. Dealing with such comments over and over, even in adulthood, was at times depleting. But it was S.\u2019s letter to Vassar that crossed a line. By November 9th, 2022, Tan was fed up. She felt like she needed to make it known. Now, S. was again publicly replying to Tan\u2019s tweets, calling her \u201ca basic bitch\u201d who \u201chacks and steals passwords [to] check out girls.\u201d Tan was done allowing a platform that had enabled her harassment to keep getting away with it. She decided to try to take control herself. Tan began to type. \u201cI have a stalker,\u201d Tan tweeted. \u201cRecently, she contacted my employer in effort to get me fired. She is racist, and has begun contacting ASIAN ACADEMICS connected w/ me on this platform. So, if that is you, there\u2019s a chance she will send a similar letter to your employer. If this happens\u2026please contact me immediately and I will put you in touch with my investigator.\u201d Tan continued: \u201cThis has been going on for almost a year. I have NEVER met this harasser. I have NEVER engaged with this harasser. This is my first time publicly acknowledging this person.\u201d Tan\u2019s tweet was shared 4,350 times and received more than 15,000 likes. She received messages from other users and academics who had stories about their own stalkers. Even after S. appeared in her timeline, Tan refused to be scared away from speaking out online or depicting her life or work in public. She still posts regularly: Photos from dinners with friends or of her horseback riding. Tweets about her syllabus, her outfits, her husband, class prepping, grading. \u201cI did it. 50 papers graded across 13 days.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop tweeting. I\u2019m not going to adjust my life for this,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cI have my book coming out at the end of this year. I don\u2019t want this person to be in the back of my head. And most of the time, she isn\u2019t.\u201d But now and then, Tan learns about the latest threat, post, or racial slur, and it upsets her all over again. Tan went into academia expecting to be challenged at times by her grading, research, or even by her own colleagues. \u201cWhen you publish or you become more public, you\u2019re always going to encounter haters, people who are ready to discredit you, people who are ready to undermine your legitimacy,\u201d Tan said. \u201cThat\u2019s true for everybody, but especially for scholars of color.\u201d Academia can be a place where it can feel, on some campuses, that Asian Americans are overrepresented. The Supreme Court recently struck down race-based admissions on college campuses. The two cases at the center of the decision argued that racial preferences have unfairly disadvantaged certain groups, using Asian Americans as plaintiffs and pawns, claiming affirmative action discriminated specifically against Asian Americans. Yet some universities, like one where Tan previously worked, enroll a student body made up of predominantly people of color, while the faculty is still overwhelmingly white. Sometimes, for other professors of color, it can feel like: \u201cWe only belong here because we were given special admission, some sort of affirmative action,\u201d as Tan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard. And the people who will really ruin you won\u2019t be the stalkers. They\u2019re going to be your peers.\u201d This can also make harassment more intimidating to report. If you don\u2019t feel supported on the ground level, you can feel even more vulnerable at the top institutional level. When it comes to S., Tan said, \u201cthere\u2019s the uncertainty of what\u2019s gonna happen next because we know that she is confrontational. We know that she\u2019s not afraid to take action. It\u2019s not just a Twitter diary,\u201d she said. \u201cIs she capable of violence?\u201d By winter, Sinha had submitted a complaint about S. to the FBI via an online portal. He also tried calling the FBI. He did not hear back. Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan also filed police reports in their local jurisdictions. \u201cThe local police here will take a complaint from us, but they won\u2019t go over there to arrest,\u201d Sinha explained. The Southern Connecticut State University Police Department had previously arrested S. She was later released, and the harassment did not stop. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. I know the flaws in the system quite well,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cEven for me, it\u2019s been eye-opening.\u201d Tan asked the Poughkeepsie Police Department in New York if they might reach out to the Hamden Police Department in Connecticut, where S. lives, for assistance. But she said Poughkeepsie police declined. Sinha reached out to the New York Division of Human Rights as a hate crime resource. Since Tan and Sinha both live or work in New York, they wanted assistance filing hate crime complaints with New York State Police. \u201cWe\u2019re all in different states,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to arrest somebody. Unless she tries to physically harm us, there\u2019s not much we can do.\u201d Every state has different laws, Sinha said. \u201cIt depends on where you are and where the perpetrator is.\u201d As a lawyer, Sinha believes there is no question that S. is breaking various laws: defamation, aggravated harassment, disorderly conduct, stalking, hate crime motivations. Some of these charges could rise to the level of felonies. Yet even with all of Sinha\u2019s knowledge, efforts, documentation, and research, he has been stonewalled. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get some traction here,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who could.\u201d It\u2019s extraordinary how indifferent police have been, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real struggle. You just need commitment from the law enforcement side, and you need a very clear and easy-to-prove violation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have enough experience with her to know that this is probably not the end of the problem,\u201d Sinha told me. It turned out he was right.\n\nI have taught journalism in academia for over a decade and have watched threats to teachers grow worse over time. In 2015, I became concerned about a student who professed having a crush on me, despite knowing I am married, and who told a colleague about his sexual feelings toward me. I reported my concerns about the inappropriate comments to my school. His behavior escalated. He already had a criminal record, including charges of sexual violence, and he talked about killing people and writing a book about it. Frightened students reported his conduct as well. His reading responses also turned dark, discussing rape and describing ideas of criminal activity, along with a lack of empathy toward murder and disaster victims. My department, program directors, and our humanities dean supported and backed me when I raised worries. But when other officials got involved, including the school police, the counseling center, and a campus dean, I was made to feel like I was being an alarmist. My own self-doubt crept in at first, and I found myself asking: Had I been too nice to this person? To make him falsely assume there was some romantic connection? \u201cI don\u2019t find him scary,\u201d one campus official working on the case said. Instead, I was informed we would make a plan to help this individual graduate. My teaching assistant and I endured and kept up instruction. Though he was not allowed to attend class in person, I spent those weeks checking door locks and plotting how I might handle an attack on my class \u2014 an agonizing mental exercise for a journalist who has also covered the immediate aftermath of college massacres, such as the one that killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007. My assistant for the course, a graduate student in the MFA program, also struggled, and the experience, among others, helped her realize she did not want to seek full-time employment in a university system again. \u201cThere were about two weeks where I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she told me recently. \u201cI would have really bad nightmares. I was worried about the students, but also for myself and for you.\u201d She kept thinking: What if something terrible happened? And it could have been prevented, she said, if we just had \u201csupport from the people power.\u201d Neither of us realized at the time that, as employees, we also could have reported the situation on our own to the Title IX office. Instead, to avoid the risk of the student showing up unannounced, we moved our class of around 50 undergraduates to a secret, unlisted location. But much of this prevention was happening on the ground, and it was spearheaded by my program directors, not from the powers above. Once the school year ended and the student graduated, my worries about his behavior dissipated but never fully went away. In the online world, other professors have not been able to move past their own harassment so easily. \u201cDeans and chairs are often unaware at all of how online abuse is actually affecting their faculty,\u201d Victoria O\u2019Meara told me. \u201cA lot of the attacks \u2014 while they may graduate to things like emails or even, in a horrible instance, people showing up on campus \u2014 they often start on social media.\u201d She explained that dealing with harassment on campuses so far has often relied on policing and a more punitive model. Less attention, O\u2019Meara said, is directed toward the well-being and mental health of the targets of the abuse, the faculty and staff. This, she added, is an area where universities and colleges can step up. It could begin with having more conversations among faculty members about stalking and harassment and institutions putting in place stronger digital protections for all employees. Resources might also involve paying for services like DeleteMe, which scrub the web of their private information, like home addresses, and providing more training for staff on online abuse, especially at a time when funding agencies are increasingly asking researchers to do more public engagement. Accessibility to academics online, she added, has only heightened their visibility and vulnerability. Professors use Twitter, now known as X, and Facebook to collaborate and connect with researchers in their field. Some also use TikTok or Instagram to promote their research. \u201cIt\u2019s not really possible anymore to be an active member of your research community without being on social media,\u201d O\u2019Meara said. Yet existing workplace harassment policies have yet to figure out how to prevent or protect faculty and staff from abuse, she explained, especially if the culprit is not someone under the authority of the institution. This reality leaves those of us who teach feeling pretty helpless, vulnerable, and always at risk of being threatened or harassed with little recourse available. \u201cA lot of the people we talk to,\u201d she said, \u201chave their hands in the air.\u201d\n\nSinha fell asleep, as he does every night, the echoes of S.\u2019s comments still in his subconscious."

    "body": "They might not be fighting each other this weekend in Saudi Arabia but Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder each enter separate tests on Saturday that could be the final hurdle before seeing the former heavyweight champions finally share the same ring in early 2024.\n\nJoshua (26-3, 23 KOs) welcomes former title challenger Otto Wallin (26-1, 14 KOs) in the main event of a blockbuster pay-per-view card dubbed \"The Day of Reckoning\" from Kingdom Arena in Riyadh (live on DAZN beginning at 11:30 a.m. ET --subscribe now). Wilder (43-2-1, 42 KOs), meanwhile, returns from a 14-month layoff to face former champion Joseph Parker (33-3, 23 KOs) in the co-main event as Saudi Arabia continues to pour money into the sport of boxing to make the kind of fights that have been difficult in the past.\n\nConsidering the 34-year-old Joshua, who lost his trio of titles to Oleksandr Usyk in 2021, has been linked to talks of a fight against Wilder, 38, dating back to when both first became titleholders in 2015, the prospect of them fighting in March, in the first of a rumored two-fight deal, is incredibly exciting.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's difficult not to ask the knee-jerk question most boxing fans are thinking: After such a long build toward this seemingly inevitable fight, why not just pair them together now?\n\nEddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport, Joshua's long-time promoter, cut right to the chase during a recent interview with \"Morning Kombat,\" referencing how hastily this weekend's card was assembled after months of rumors that the two heavyweights could appear on the same card.\n\n\"I think we had six weeks and the card was put together quickly,\" Hearn said. \"By the way, I think Otto Wallin is a very dangerous fight six weeks out. [Joshua] is in there with a southpaw who is just coming off a victory over [former cruiserweight titleholder Murat] Gassiev. And Joseph Parker is full of confidence and Wilder has been out for a long time.\n\n\"But, look, the reason they are fighting on the same card and the reason we are all going to Saudi Arabia is that we want to make Joshua and Wilder in Saudi Arabia. But everybody wants that fight to happen and if they both win on [Saturday] there is a great chance that you see what I think is the biggest fight in boxing.\"\n\nThe main problem with marination in boxing over the past few decades is that placing big-name fighters into bouts they could lose -- which is the case for both Joshua and Wilder, despite each being sizable betting favorites -- has proven to be a major mistake because of upsets. In this case, neither Joshua nor Wilder are champions, so it's possible that the fights against each other still take pace, regardless of defeat, simply due to the sizable investment from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I think a win makes it look great on paper for both of us [in terms of] fighting each other,\" Wilder said during Monday's \"Morning Kombat\" interview. \"But it's no added pressure on my end. Maybe for Joshua, there's more pressure for him than I because I know what I'm coming to do. I'm blessed with God-given power and it's natural. There is nothing I have to inject my body with. There is no type of contaminated meat that I have to eat to make me feel some kind of way. I don't have to alter my gloves in any way, it's all natural to me.\"\n\nAfter coming up empty in the final two fights of his trilogy with Tyson Fury, both of which ended via violent stoppage, Wilder sat out a full year before returning last October to knock out Robert Helenius in Round 1. Wilder went on to enjoy a bit of a spiritual rebirth after attending an Ayahuasca retreat in South America and has been noticeably happier as a result.\n\nThis is a far cry from the more combative side of Wilder that shared more than a few conspiracy theories as to why he lost to Fury, and even fired co-trainer Mark Breland for throwing in the towel to save Wilder from further punishment in his 2020 Fury rematch.\n\n\"My mindspace is in a wonderful place. It's in an over-happy place,\" Wilder said. \"I'm always smiling nowadays. It's a joy to be able to enjoy life. Life passes us by so quickly because we are living in borrowed time, nothing is promised. You have to enjoy every moment.\"\n\nJoshua, the global star from the United Kingdom, has also traversed a difficult road mentally from his pair of title losses to Usyk, which triggered yet another trainer change and more than a few bizarre interviews where Joshua has appeared defensive and agitated. He recently attended a darkness retreat where he spent four days alone in a pitch black room in isolation.\n\nThe troubles for Joshua appear to link all the way back to his 2019 upset loss to late replacement Andy Ruiz Jr. at New York's Madison Square Garden, which came as part of a much-publicized U.S. debut. Even though Joshua would regain his titles in their immediate rematch, as Ruiz came to Saudi Arabia in obese physical shape, he has been undergoing a bit of an identity crisis as a boxer in the aftermath, even with a pair of 2023 rebound victories over Jermaine Franklin and Helenius (who also fought Joshua as a late replacement).\n\nCan't get enough boxing and MMA? Get the latest in the world of combat sports from two of the best in the business. Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news, including a complete preview of what to expect from both Joshua and Wilder in separate bouts at Day of Reckoning below.\n\n\"This is just purely about doing the right thing and being 100 percent perfect every second that I am in that ring,\" Joshua told CBS Sports. \"That way I will be victorious and victory will come by knockout if I carry out my plan A, B and C; it will lead me to the KO.\n\n\"Otto Wallin is a southpaw so he's very tricky. We have to be very clever. He has a character that is very resilient, as we saw against Tyson Fury. He can box off the back foot and come forward so it's going to be a good challenge for us because he's a complete fighter.\"\n\nWallin, a 33-year-old native of Sweden, is considered much more a live dog than Parker. Standing only half of an inch shorter than Joshua's 6-foot-6 frame, Wallin is a southpaw whose reputation was extremely bolstered in 2019 when he lost a title shot against Fury despite opening up a cut that required 47 stitches above Fury's eye and came close to giving Wallin a stoppage win.\n\nThe 33-year-old Parker, a New Zealand native who lost his WBO title to Joshua in their 2018 unification bout, is younger than Wallin but not considered as big of a threat to upset Wilder due to the gap in punching power between them. Still, Parker is an experienced boxer who owns wins over Ruiz, Hughie Fury and Derek Chisora. And despite a reputation damaging stoppage loss to Joe Joyce in 2022, has had plenty of experience in recent years under head trainer Andy Lee in the camp of Tyson Fury, who was 2-0-1 in this three fights with Wilder.\n\n\"Tyson has been very helpful and has given good advice,\" Parker told CBS Sports on Monday. \"[Andy Lee and I] came up with a good plan and have leaned on Tyson for a bit of advice. The big difference is that I don't have the same height and reach [as Fury]. But my strengths are different to his strengths and I will use mine to the best of my ability.\n\n\"You will see on fight night, I'm going to put on the best performance. I'm going to be quick and I'm going to be fast and I'm going to be punching with a lot of power. I'm going to be deliberate and I'm going to smash his face.\"\n\nThe undercard is loaded up with other top heavyweights looking to make a splash and stay in title contention as Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk prepare to crown an undisputed champion in early 2024. A win on Saturday for any of these men could put them in line for a shot at one of the four recognized titles at some time next year.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of this loaded up undercard with the latest odds before getting to predictions and expert picks on the co-headliners.\n\nDay of Reckoning fight card, odds\n\nFighter Fighter Weight class Anthony Joshua -455 Otto Wallin +345 Heavyweight Deontay Wilder -650 Joseph Parker +460 Heavyweight Dmitry Bivol (c) -3500 Lyndon Arthur +1350 WBA light heavyweight title Daniel Dubois -220 Jarrell Miller +180 Heavyweight Jai Opetaia -2400 Ellis Zorro +1150 Cruiserweight Arslanbek Makhmudov -1000 Agit Kabayel +650 Heavyweight Frank Sanchez -2000 Junior Fa +1050 Heavyweight Filip Hrgovic Mark De Morio Heavyweight\n\nDay of Reckoning viewing info\n\nDate: Dec. 23\n\n\n\nDec. 23 Location: Kingdom Arena -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\n\n\nKingdom Arena -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Start time: 11:30 a.m. ET\n\n11:30 a.m. ET How to watch: DAZN PPV (subscribe now) | Price: $39.99\n\nPredictions\n\nAlthough the rest of Saturday's super card features recognized names, including 2022 fighter of the year Dmitry Bivol, the majority of matchups are one-sided on paper. Luckily for fans, both Wilder and Joshua have signed up for fights they could very well lose.\n\nYet, given the amount of money at stake in the pending two-fight series between the two, and the lack of finishing power from both Wallin and Parker, it's more likely things go to plan for the big-money investors who have spared no expenses to not only make the event happen but continue Saudi Arabia's plans to be a new global hub for big-time combat sports events.\n\nEven with the layoff, Wilder has the power and conditioning to eventually catch Parker, even if the former champion is able to outbox Wilder leading up to a possible late stoppage. For as much as Wilder often gets criticized for his technical disadvantages, despite being a former U.S. Olympic bronze medalist, he has long shown the patience to make opponents pay for even the slightest mistake late in a bout.\n\nJoshua, on the other hand, will likely have to work harder. He committed too much to being a boxer in both losses to Usyk, when playing the role of physical and mauling puncher could've been a more sound strategy. And was both passive and boring for the majority of his fight against Helenius before delivering a perfect knockout blow that reminded fans of his power and natural finishing skills.\n\nAs long as Joshua commits to playing the role of the bigger man, it's likely he does enough to take a decision. The same result that would be difficult to see Wallin get the nod for winning unless he does so in dominant fashion given the financial commitment that region has given to employing Joshua's services as a global star.\n\nWhile it may be a bit more of a dicey walk for Joshua than Wilder on this day, both bouts are expected to be competitive.\n\nPicks: Wilder via KO8; Joshua via UD12"

    "body": "The \u201cdisturbing images\u201d warning is one that Gen Z, the first fully digital native cohort, is used to encountering on their lingua franca: social media posts. On Saturday, the Islamic militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, resulting in the worst war the region has seen in 50 years. In three days, more than 1,500 people have died on both sides, and graphic, difficult-to-watch videos have blanketed the internet\u2014from Israeli civilians being captured, tortured, and killed by Hamas militants, to Palestinian civilians screaming in grief, and people on both sides attending to their dead and injured among the rubble.\n\nIf Gen Z feels like they\u2019ve seen it all, in some ways, they have. This generation, ages 11 to 26, has already lived through numerous historic events, ranging from a once-per-century pandemic, to the Jan. 6 insurrection\u2014an event unseen for centuries in American politics. Then there\u2019s the first major European ground war since World War II in Ukraine, not to mention market crashes in 2008 and 2020 that recall the Great Depression itself. As the first digitally native generation, Gen Z is experiencing it all through videos, images, and articles online, which is shaping their mental health, workplace attitudes, and financial habits in visible ways.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, this Gen Z reporter notes, that 46% of young workers ages 18 to 26 say that they are regularly so distraught over what is happening in the news that they are unable to function at work, according to a 2023 Edelman report. By comparison, 38% of millennials, 24% of Gen Xers, and 19% of baby boomers and older generations say the same.\n\nEverything about their behavior communicates that Gen Z is just not okay with it. This ranges from their widespread, hell-bent determination to find purpose in work and pushing their employers to have a social conscience, to a sense of despair over their own and the world\u2019s future finances. They have largely given up on saving money and instead dish out for little \u201ctreats\u201d as a way to cope with the larger absurdity of 21st-century life.\n\nConsider the lifetime that was three years ago, as Gen Z emerged into young adulthood, when online videos of the murder of George Floyd shook the country in May 2020, resulting in a summer of violent Black Lives Matter protests and riots. A year later, people watched as armed right-wing extremists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following the election defeat of former President Donald Trump. Then there are school shootings, which have only increased in frequency since Columbine in 1999, with more students documenting the terror on their phones and sharing it online. One of them was the Parkland shooting of 2018, which tragically created the first spokespeople of the post-millennial generation.\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental health\n\nGen Z has the worst reported mental health of any generation\u201445% of young people report having \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d mental health, according to a 2018 report by the American Psychological Association.\n\nOne of the major sources of Gen Z\u2019s distress, of course, is climate change. Nearly seven in 10 Gen Zers say they experience anxiety when viewing climate change content on social media, according to a 2021 Pew Research report. But they\u2019re not just reading about the detrimental effects of human-caused global warming, they\u2019re living through the consequences themselves.\n\nThis summer reached record-breaking temperatures, with July being the hottest month the planet has seen in over 100,000 years. As a result, Arizona experienced a monthlong heat wave with temperatures at or above 110 degrees every day. Deadly fires broke out across the Mediterranean; suffocating smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed New York City and the Northeast for days; and ice melt in the Arctic accelerated.\n\nAnd extreme heat is likely here to stay\u2014and get worse\u2014unless countries can rapidly reduce their carbon emissions. That\u2019s why Gen Z is more concerned with sustainability than any generation before them. Just look at Greta Thunberg: The 20-year-old has become one of the best-known environmental activists, famously speaking at the United Nations in 2019 with scathing words for world leaders:\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I\u2019m one of the lucky ones,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cPeople are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d\n\nGen Z in the workplace\n\nBy 2030, Gen Z will account for nearly one-third of the U.S. workforce, but they\u2019re already radically redefining the meaning of work.\n\nGen Zers want a sense of purpose, so they prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) in the workplace, which encompasses their companies taking accountability for their sustainability and environmental impacts, providing education and awareness for social issues, and ensuring diverse and inclusive boards and teams.\n\nAnd it tracks: Roughly two-thirds of Gen Zers say they frequently speak about important societal issues while at work, according to the Edelman report. They\u2019re also influencing their older coworkers when it comes to areas like work-life balance, fair pay, and employers\u2019 involvement on social issues.\n\nGen Z\u2019s financial stress\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, Gen Zers have also lived through a global pandemic that shuttered the world for nearly two years, two recessions, and a mounting student debt crisis, leaving them with little savings but an abundance of financial despair.\n\nRoughly 60% of Gen Zers say they are stressed about money this year more than last year, according to a Bankrate survey from July. It\u2019s no surprise either\u201485% of Gen Zers say that they couldn\u2019t afford one month\u2019s expenses if they lost their job today.\n\nAnd since young people are typically affected by inflation the most, as they are the most likely to work part-time or low-paying jobs, this economic climate may have left Gen Z with permanent \u201cpsychological scars,\u201d one expert says.\n\n\u201cHow can young people build careers or wealth if they don\u2019t have jobs, and prices of goods and services continue to increase?\u201d Dayo Abinusawa, founder of London\u2019s Awa Business School and a former lecturer at Cambridge University\u2019s Judge Business School, previously told Fortune.\n\nOne Fidelity survey backs this argument: 45% of 18- to 35-year-olds \u201cdon\u2019t see a point in saving until things return to normal.\u201d Some Gen Zers have even adopted the mentality that \u201cmoney isn\u2019t real\u201d and are justifying spending on items to \u201ctreat themselves\u201d amid a bleak reality.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nOf course, every generation has lived through era-defining historical events. Millennials remember the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Baby boomers lived through the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. But no other generation has been plugged into the world through the internet from such a young age like Gen Z.\n\nGen Z is already wielding their power in notable and sometimes comical ways. In June 2020, teenage TikTok users (with the help of K-pop fans) claimed to have sunk a Trump campaign rally by registering for thousands of tickets with no intention of actually attending. And last summer, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a then-19-year-old activist raised over $2 million in abortion funds by trolling Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\nIt remains to be seen what they will do when Gen Z comes into decision-making positions in the workplace\u2014perhaps they\u2019ll channel their rage and cynicism effectively as some have already demonstrated\u2014but Abinusawa warned that \u201ca society where the young have little to no hope for the future is not a sustainable one.\u201d"

    "body": "One of the grand challenges in climate science is to reduce uncertainty in estimates of climate sensitivity, which quantifies how much Earth\u2019s surface warms in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide relative to preindustrial levels. This uncertainty is large because climate sensitivity aggregates myriad processes, from microscale aerosol-cloud interactions to planetary-scale atmospheric and ocean circulations, into one number. Clouds, which are notoriously difficult to measure and simulate, are the main driver of the uncertainty.\n\nVarious lines of evidence are used to estimate climate sensitivity, including climate model simulations of varying complexity, observations over the past century, proxies that measure climate change in the distant past, and theory. The likely range of estimates of climate sensitivity was stubbornly constant at a distressingly imprecise 1.5\u20134.5 K for several decades, but the research community\u2019s efforts have recently chipped away at this range (Figure 1).\n\nEarly in the 2010s, a substantial discrepancy was noted between estimates of climate sensitivity derived from climate models and estimates based on the observed warming record and radiative balance, the balance between incoming and reflected solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation. Estimates based on observed warming pointed to much lower values than those derived from models. A key breakthrough toward solving this conundrum has been the recognition of the pattern effect, the process whereby climate sensitivity depends on the geographic pattern of surface warming. This advance was rated as one of the most promising avenues for further constraining climate sensitivity in the future [Forster et al., 2021].\n\nForcing, Feedbacks, and Climate Sweet Spots\n\nAdding greenhouse gases to Earth\u2019s atmosphere leads to a global energy surplus (less terrestrial radiation escapes to space), referred to as forcing. To restore the energy balance, the planet must warm. But warming causes changes in the climate system: The concentration of water vapor\u2014a greenhouse gas\u2014in the atmosphere increases, the spatial coverage of highly reflective snow and sea ice decreases, and cloud properties change. These and other radiative feedbacks amplify or dampen how much the planet warms in response to the forcing. Hence, for a given forcing, the feedbacks determine the climate sensitivity.\n\nA degree of global warming spread out evenly will cause a different radiative response than if that same warming is concentrated in a climate sweet spot.\n\nFor decades, researchers assumed that global mean radiative feedbacks mostly depend on global mean temperature [Gregory et al., 2004]. However, they also depend on the spatial pattern of surface warming: Much like applying a force uniformly over someone\u2019s entire body will elicit a very different reaction than tickling the soles of that person\u2019s feet, a degree of global warming spread out evenly will cause a different radiative response than if that same warming were concentrated in a climate sweet spot (a location where surface warming produces efficient radiative damping).\n\nA wide variety of processes affect the evolution of surface temperature, from greenhouse gas forcing and regional aerosol forcing to natural oscillations involving the ocean and atmosphere to the continental boundary conditions and the extent of ice sheets and sea ice. The pattern of surface temperature change over the past 40 or so years featured a pronounced spatial structure, with some locations even cooling in spite of the global mean warming on the order of 1 K (Figure 2, bottom left).\n\nFig. 2. At left is the surface and vertical structure of warming observed over the past few decades in the tropical Pacific. Strong warming in regions of deep convection such as the western Pacific is communicated throughout the troposphere and leads to strong warming aloft, enhancing radiative emission to space. In contrast, parts of the eastern Pacific have cooled. Warming aloft and cooling at the surface enhance the lower tropospheric inversion strengths in the eastern Pacific and promote extensive shallow cloud cover that reflects solar radiation and keeps Earth relatively cool. At right is a typical representation of climate change simulated with coupled climate models, which create their own surface warming pattern that differs from the observed one. In coupled model simulations, warming aloft is less pronounced, and relative to the observed case, the lower tropospheric inversion strength is decreased, and cloud cover is reduced through time. Both factors lead to less efficient cooling near Earth\u2019s surface in models than in nature.\n\nFeedbacks involving clouds and the atmospheric temperature structure are most sensitive to spatial differences in warming. Deep convection in the warmest tropical regions readily communicates surface conditions upward throughout the troposphere (up to about 10\u201315 kilometers) and then horizontally across much of the globe, making the western Pacific a climate sweet spot. This warmer air sitting atop the relatively cool waters in the eastern Pacific or Southern Ocean acts to stabilize the lowermost troposphere, allowing more extensive low-lying stratus and stratocumulus clouds to develop. Because of their location and structure, these low clouds efficiently cool the planet and offset some of the initial warming (Figure 2, top left).\n\nApproaching the Problem from Different Angles\n\nThree strands of research have converged over the past few years, highlighting that understanding the pattern effect benefits from contributions from virtually all climate research communities.\n\nHistorically, three strands of research have highlighted the dependence of radiative feedbacks on the surface warming pattern. The first strand came from analyses of climate feedbacks and sensitivity in model simulations of unequilibrated, transient climate change. If feedbacks were constant, the expected equilibrium temperature change (climate sensitivity) could be estimated using a very simple energy balance model that linearly extrapolates the relationship between global temperature change and radiative imbalance [e.g., Gregory et al., 2004]. When longer, fully equilibrated simulations became available, it became evident that the simple estimation methods assuming constant feedbacks systematically underestimate the actual equilibrium climate sensitivity. The reason for this underestimation is indeed the evolution of the surface warming pattern, which initially emphasizes more stabilizing radiative feedbacks but later, during equilibration, emphasizes less stabilizing radiative feedbacks [e.g., Senior and Mitchell, 2000; Rugenstein et al., 2020].\n\nThe second strand related the idea of constant feedbacks to the efforts of estimating equilibrium climate sensitivity from the historical record, as mentioned above. Feedbacks calculated from observations or from atmosphere-only model simulations forced with the observed surface warming pattern over the past couple of decades imply less warming than those from model simulations with a fully interactive ocean, which have the freedom to create their own surface warming patterns [e.g., Gregory et al., 2020].\n\nThe third strand of research came from oceanography, showing that the atmospheric cooling effect of ocean heat uptake differs depending on where it occurs: One unit of ocean heat uptake in high latitudes cools Earth more effectively than the same unit taken up by the low-latitude oceans. This difference is relevant because the largest heat uptake by the ocean occurs at higher latitudes. The effect, termed ocean heat uptake efficacy, turns out to be another manifestation of the dependence of radiative feedbacks on surface temperature patterns [Winton et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2021].\n\nThe three strands of research have converged over the past few years, highlighting that understanding the pattern effect benefits from\u2014and perhaps requires\u2014contributions from virtually all climate research communities studying large-scale ocean-atmosphere coupling and the dynamics that set regional to global responses to external forcing.\n\nTo foster this work across communities, 140 scientists from around the world and from different disciplines gathered for a US CLIVAR (U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program) workshop in May 2022 in Boulder, Colo. Below, we present the current consensus that emerged during the workshop and raise questions that require urgent attention from scientists.\n\nThe Past Is a Poor Analogue for the Future\n\nResearch on the pattern effect has exposed limitations of using equilibrium climate sensitivity to constrain future warming and, conversely, of using recently observed warming to constrain equilibrium climate sensitivity. The foremost implication of the pattern effect is that historically observed climate change does not constrain the upper limit of climate sensitivity [Sherwood et al., 2020; Forster et al., 2021].\n\nThe reason for the poor predictive power of the climate record from past decades is that the observed surface warming pattern caused feedbacks that were more stabilizing than the ones projected for the future. The warming was particularly pronounced in the sweet spots of the western Pacific and the subtropical eastern Pacific\u2014a perfect combination for enhanced radiative damping (Figure 2, left). In particular, low-lying cumulus clouds in the eastern Pacific covered a larger area and reflected more sunlight back to space than studies suggest they will in the future.\n\nDifficulty in quantifying the pattern effect stems from uncertainties in observed surface temperature trends, the magnitude of ocean heat uptake, and the short observational record of Earth\u2019s energy budget.\n\nImportantly, the measurement and magnitude of the observed pattern effect are still debated and uncertain. The current best estimate is that the radiative feedback or damping under idealized, long-term carbon dioxide forcing is 0.5 \u00b1 0.5 watt per square meter per kelvin weaker than the radiative feedback seen since the late 1800s [Andrews et al., 2022]; 0.5 watt per square meter per kelvin is similar in magnitude to the single radiative feedbacks that the pattern effect modifies. The wide range of uncertainty opens two contrasting possibilities: The pattern effect might have acted to retard global warming fairly strongly\u2014in other words, mean global warming might have been much higher by now if the recent surface warming had come about in a different spatial pattern. This possibility implies that the pattern effect has the potential to influence future near-term warming rates strongly as the surface warming pattern evolves. The other end of the uncertainty range implies that the pattern effect might have been negligible over the past century and that it might apply only over shorter timescales or in drastically different climate states.\n\nDifficulty in quantifying the pattern effect stems from uncertainties in observed surface temperature trends, the magnitude of ocean heat uptake, and the short observational record of Earth\u2019s energy budget. Our incomplete quantitative understanding of how clouds react to their environment and how these dependences are represented in the highly parameterized climate models further limits our ability to quantify the full range of the possible and recently realized pattern effect.\n\nPressing, fundamental questions for climate dynamics concern how surface temperature patterns come about, how Earth\u2019s radiation budget depends on the details of the surface temperature patterns, and the extent to which the two depend on each other. In other words, first, we need to improve our understanding of drivers of sea surface temperature patterns\u2014decadal coupled variability; the pace and spatial structure of ocean heat uptake; and forcing by aerosols, greenhouse gases, and volcanoes\u2014as well as the relative timing of these drivers. An important goal is to explain historical patterns quantitatively and to predict their likely future evolution. Second, we need to quantify the dependence of local and remote top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes on the magnitude, spatial scale, and sign (positive or negative) of surface temperature changes. Third, we have to explain how ocean heat uptake and radiative feedback are connected on various timescales, both globally and regionally.\n\nInterpreting Paleorecords Requires Caution\n\nIn the same way that the historical evolution of surface warming and the planet\u2019s radiation budget inform Earth\u2019s future only to a limited extent, analyses of paleorecords for recent and deep time intervals must account for the pattern effect to be applicable to climate projections of the future. For example, the cooling pattern during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) differed from the warming pattern observed currently and from those expected for the next couple of decades and expected in the equilibrium following a doubling of carbon dioxide, not only in sign but also in the spatial distribution of magnitudes. The LGM currently provides the best constraint on the upper bound of equilibrium climate sensitivity [Sherwood et al., 2020], and hence, the details of the pattern effect matter greatly.\n\nOutstanding questions concern how representative pattern changes in the past century, the past millennium, or quasi-equilibrated times millions of years ago are of expected future changes.\n\nIn addition to our growing knowledge of the pattern effect, we also have learned that radiative feedbacks depend on global mean temperature itself: Warming Earth by 1 K from the LGM emphasizes different feedbacks (e.g., the sea ice albedo feedback) than warming by 1 K from a Miocene hothouse world or warming from 4 to 5 K in a high-emission scenario in a century or two from today (e.g., the water vapor feedback [Bloch-Johnson et al., 2021]). The pattern effect and the feedback temperature dependence add uncertainties to estimates of climate sensitivity based on the paleorecord, but quantifying their effects would make these records more relevant to constraining climate sensitivity and expected future warming.\n\nOutstanding questions concern how representative pattern changes in the past century, the past millennium, or quasi-equilibrated times millions of years ago are of expected future changes. The paleorecord could further be crucial for understanding the timescales and relative importance of internal variability, forced response, and extratropical forcing to rates of warming or cooling in the equatorial Pacific in nature and in climate models.\n\nShould We Trust Model Patterns in Climate Change Scenarios?\n\nOur understanding of the pattern effect raises the question of whether climate models can reproduce observed warming patterns. Coupled climate models simulate a freely evolving ocean surface and hence have their own expression of internal variability. For example, we would not expect a coupled model to simulate El Ni\u00f1o events at the same time as they happened in nature, except by chance. This feature complicates comparisons between models and observations, especially on decadal timescales and beyond, for which we know little about the spectrum of internal variability in the real world.\n\nUnfortunately, coupled climate models seem unable to simulate observed surface warming patterns across some key regions in which surface sensitivity modulates clouds, even when they account for internal variability. Most important, models do not re-create observed cooling in the equatorial and subtropical eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean (Figure 2, right), and it is concerning that all models have the same sign of error in the trend patterns [e.g., Wills et al., 2022]. In addition, models strongly disagree about the timescales over which future warming may occur in these regions.\n\nThe advent of global coupled storm- and cloud-resolving models, which currently can simulate only a few months to years at a time, presents an exciting opportunity.\n\nOur limited knowledge of the drivers of surface warming pattern biases in climate models hampers our ability to evaluate these biases. We do not know whether these models\u2019 inability to reproduce observed trends is due to biases in how they represent the spectrum of internal variability, aerosol forcing, ocean-atmosphere interactions, deep and shallow atmospheric convection, Southern Ocean cloud-radiative properties, ocean thermocline depth, and ocean circulation or something else entirely.\n\nThe most pressing question is whether climate model simulations will be as far off from observations in the future as they have been relative to recent past conditions (compare Figure 2, left and right). If this turns out to be the case, how will model biases in surface warming trends be reflected in radiative feedbacks and global mean warming rates? We need to quantify whether coupled models compensate for their bias in the surface warming pattern and radiative feedbacks through erroneous ocean heat uptake rates or aerosol forcings.\n\nThe advent of global coupled storm- and cloud-resolving models, which currently can simulate only a few months to years at a time, presents an exciting opportunity. How do we evaluate surface warming patterns and radiative feedbacks in these simulations and compare them meaningfully to observations and coarser resolution models, knowing that even several decades are not enough to robustly detect a forced trend in some regions? And most pressing for the communities relying on the coupled models\u2019 climate change projections, To what extent are the remaining carbon budgets [Zhou et al., 2021] with respect to global warming targets, rates of near-term future warming, and detection and attribution efforts contingent on the pattern effect?\n\nA Collaborative Outlook\n\nWorking to solve the problems outlined above at the intersection of different disciplines and with input from different research communities will likely benefit related research into, for example, the sensitivity of tropical cyclones and future rainfall changes in the southwestern United States or in South America to surface warming patterns.\n\nPromising new tools and observations are beginning to emerge. They include targeted model experiments and intercomparisons, extended global satellite observations of clouds and radiation, Argo floats sampling deep-ocean heat uptake, estimates of radiative imbalances before the year 2000, and new observational constraints on clouds\u2019 sensitivity to environmental controlling factors. These developments encourage an optimistic outlook on our ability to quantify the pattern effect and its implications over the next couple of years.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank all participants of the US CLIVAR pattern effect workshop.

So Meta\u2019s updated offer to EU users is either hand over your privacy or hand over your hard earned cash.\n\n\u201cThis is an unfair choice for users, which runs afoul of EU consumer law on several counts and must be stopped,\u201d said the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) in a press release announcing the complaint will be filed with the network of consumer protection authorities (CPC) today.\n\nBEUC has been joined in the complaint by 18 of its member organizations \u2014 a variety of consumer advocacy groups which are located in the following EU member states: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe groups are objecting both to how Meta has gone about implementing the \u201cpay-or-consent model\u201d \u2014 using what they assess as \u201cunfair, deceptive and aggressive practices\u201d \u2014 and to the model itself, which they dub \u201cillegal\u201d. They have also raised data protection concerns which are already the focus of the complaint sent to the Austrian data protection authority earlier this week by the privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, said:\n\nThe choice the tech giant is currently providing to consumers is unfair and illegal \u2014 the millions of European users of Facebook and Instagram deserve far better than this. Meta is breaching EU consumer law by using unfair, deceptive and aggressive practices, including partially blocking consumers from using the services to force them to take a decision quickly, and providing misleading and incomplete information in the process. Consumer protection authorities in the EU must now spring into action and force the tech giant to stop this practice.\n\nSummarizing the issues identified with Meta\u2019s model under consumer protection law BEUC writes:\n\nMeta is partially blocking the use of Facebook and Instagram until users have selected one option or the other, which constitutes an aggressive practice under European consumer law. Through persistence and by creating a sense of urgency, Meta pushes consumers into making a choice they might not want to take.\n\nIn addition, many consumers likely think that, by opting for the paid subscription as it is presented, they get a privacy-friendly option involving less tracking and profiling. In fact, users are likely to continue to have their personal data collected and used, but for purposes other than ads.\n\nMeta provides misleading and incomplete information to consumers which does not allow them to make an informed choice. Meta is misleading them by presenting the choice as between a paying and a \u2018free\u2019 option, while the latter option is not \u2018free\u2019 because consumers pay Meta through the provision of their data, as past court rulings have already declared.\n\nGiven the market power of Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram services in the EU and the very strong network effects of social media platforms (since all your friends are on Facebook and Instagram), consumers do not have a real choice because if they quit the services they would lose all their contacts and interactions built over the years. The very high subscription fee for \u2018ad-free\u2019 services is also a deterrent for consumers, which means consumers do not have a real choice.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s approach also raises concerns regarding the GDPR,\u201d Pachl further noted. And a spokesman for BEUC told us it might, at a later stage, file a complaint about Meta\u2019s data protection compliance with the relevant privacy authority, once it has completed its own assessment of the issues. Although he emphasized it\u2019s too early to say whether or not it will take that step.\n\nMeta\u2019s lead data protection authority in the EU, Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC), has, for several months, been assessing its pay or consent offer. But it has yet to communicate a conclusion. In the meanwhile, Meta maintains that the model it has devised for obtaining users\u2019 consent to its ads processing complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (Although the adtech giant also said that when it was claiming performance of a contract and then legitimate interests for the processing \u2014 both of which were subsequently found to be incompatible with the GDPR.)\n\nThe \u2018pay or okay\u2019 model Meta is seeking to impose on EU users wasn\u2019t actually its invention; it was \u2018pioneered\u2019 in Austria, by the daily newspaper Der Standard \u2014 after which copycat cookie paywalls quickly sprung up on a raft of news publishers in Germany and elsewhere in the EU.\n\nnoyb has been challenging this \u2018pay or okay\u2019 approach to GDPR consent since 2021\u2014 filing complaints with a number of data protection authorities, arguing the model forces newspaper readers to \u201cbuy back their own data at exorbitant prices\u201d.\n\nSome DPAs appear to have been sympathetic to local newspapers\u2019 use of cookie walls, seeing it as a way to support the production of journalism. However when it comes to Meta, that argument evaporates as it\u2019s definitely not in the journalism business. Moreover the adtech giant doesn\u2019t even need to produce content to pump around its social networks; it gets all that filler for free from the self-same users it\u2019s now demanding pay a fee if they want to use its services without being tracked and profiled for behavioral advertising. Which, well, makes Meta\u2019s \u2018pay or okay\u2019 model feel like even more of a rip off.\n\nBack in April, a decision by Austria\u2019s DPA on a noyb complaint about cookie paywalls said users must have the ability to say yes or no to specific data operations \u2014 meaning blanket consent is not an option. But the result left it unclear how cookie paywalls might be operated in a way that\u2019s GDPR compliant and the privacy rights group vowed to fight the decision in court. \u201cThe final decision on \u2018pay or okay\u2019 may be made by the European Court of Justice (CJEU) in the long run,\u201d noyb predicted at the time.\n\nMeta is likely banking on another multi year round of GDPR complaints, legal challenges and \u2014 finally \u2014 a referral to the CJEU, followed by another long wait before a ruling gets handed down, buying it several more years to run with its new legal basis fix and keep feeding its profits by doing what it likes with Europeans\u2019 data.\n\nBut the consumer protection challenge could complicate its usual playbook.\n\nThe CPC has brought more coordinated action on consumer protection concerns in the EU in recent years, bringing multiple consumer groups together to tackle common concerns \u2014 helped by one or more national consumer protection authority which gets appointed to drive the effort. The process also loops in the European Commission to help facilitate dialogue, assess issues and bring pressure to bear on unfair practices.\n\nThe CPC alert and mobilization process can be quicker than GDPR enforcement when it comes to forcing changes to unfair behaviors. Although it still typically takes months, plural, for the network to coordinate and arrive at a position to press on a trader they believe is infringing the law.\n\nThe network also can\u2019t impose fines itself. But if issues aren\u2019t resolved through the dialogues and commitments process it shoots for, national consumer protection authorities can still pursue enforcement at a local level. So if, at the end of the day, these consumer advocacy groups aren\u2019t happy with whatever the process of pressing Meta for changes will have achieved they can still press complaints to national authorities to urge them to take enforcement action (and those CPAs have the ability to impose penalties of up to 4% of global annual turnover).\n\nIn recent times, a raft of complaints to the CPC about TikTok led \u2014 just last year \u2014 to the video sharing social network pledging to improve user reporting and disclosure requirements around ads/sponsored content; and to boost transparency around its digital coins and virtual gifts. Although BEUC was not ecstatic about the outcome, saying significant concerns remained unaddressed.\n\nStill, the CPC network may be able to extract some \u2018quick win\u2019 concessions from Meta \u2014 such as requiring it to amend how it presents the available \u2018Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 to users. Meta could also potentially face pressure to lower the subscription fee to make it more more affordable for users to deny tracking. (Just spitballing here but imagine if it were offering a choice of tracking ads vs paying \u20ac1 a year not to be tracked which wouldn\u2019t look so evidently self-serving.)\n\nAsked whether the issue for consumer protection authorities is the \u2018pay or consent\u2019 choice Meta is offering or how it\u2019s gone about implementing it, BEUC\u2019s spokesman said the questions are hard to separate as they\u2019re \u201cclosely interlinked\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnder consumer law, you need an informed and fair choice to purchase such a subscription. The first question is also dependent on compliance with data protection law. If the practice infringes the GDPR, the fact that it infringes a law which aims to protect fundamental rights should in our opinion be considered unfair and illegal under consumer law too,\u201d he told us, adding: \u201cIn any case, the choice is designed in a way that is unfair, aggressive and misleading.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission itself has an additional oversight role on Meta directly as the company is also subject to the EU\u2019s shiny new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA). In the latter case its social networks, Facebook and Instagram, were designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) earlier this year. And, since late August, they\u2019ve been expected to be compliant with that digital rulebook.\n\nBoth pan-EU laws put restrictions on the use of personal data for advertising \u2014 explicitly requiring consent is obtained from users for such a purpose; and that consent must be as easy to withhold as to affirm. So one issue the Commission \u2014 which is the sole enforcer of the DSA on VLOPs \u2014 might weigh in in the coming months on is whether clicking accept vs digging out a credit card to pay a monthly charge are equivalently easy.\n\nThe regulation also contains provisions which are intended to combat unfair/deceptive design, such as targeting choice interfaces that make it \u201cmore difficult or time-consuming\u201d to pick one option over another. Although the DSA\u2019s provisions against dark patterns are only intended to be applied where consumer protection and privacy laws, which also take aim against unfair choices, don\u2019t."

    "body": "Meta wants to shift the burden of monitoring social media usage among teens back to the app stores \u2014 and to parents. In a blog post published today, Meta\u2019s global head of Safety, Antigone Davis, argues that parents should be responsible for approving their teens\u2019 app downloads and staked Meta\u2019s position in supporting federal legislation that would require parental approval for app downloads for users under the age of 16.\n\nGuiding its reasoning, Meta pointed to recent Pew research that indicated that 81% of U.S. adults were in favor of requiring parental consent for teens to create social media accounts. While this may speak to popular opinion around parental sentiment, it doesn\u2019t mean that parents have thought through who should be responsible for preventing or allowing teens\u2019 access to social media, or how those apps should operate to protect teens.\n\nA coalition of 42 states and D.C. are currently suing Meta over its harms to teens and young users, in part referencing findings from Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen. The former employee had provided to news outlets a treasure trove of documents that appeared to indicate Meta understood the harms it was causing \u2014 including things like body image issues among teens \u2014 but didn\u2019t take action. Instagram head Adam Mosseri was later hauled before Congress in December 2021 to defend the app\u2019s teen safety record, but so far, legislators have not come to any decision about how to regulate teen usage of these platforms.\n\nInstead, Meta began regulating itself, adding new defaults and features that would restrict teens\u2019 access to content on its apps, protect their privacy and limit ad targeting to teens, as well as introducing parental controls.\n\nIn more recent weeks, a second Meta whistleblower, Arturo Bejar, has come forward to express concerns that Instagram\u2019s approach to protecting teens wasn\u2019t working to keep them safe from sexual predators and unwanted sexual advances and harassment. Hired as a consultant on the matter, Bejar eventually blew the whistle on Meta after seeing issues remain unresolved following years of work. His argument essentially was that the improvements and safety features Meta was implementing were not enough and not effective.\n\nHowever, a policy position like the one Meta announced today is not something that would have been rushed out in a matter of days as a PR response to Bejar\u2019s claims, but something Meta has been stewing on for some time. After all, the app stores already have age guidelines, so it would seem to follow that they should also enforce them, if enforcement is to be regulated \u2014 or that seems to be Meta\u2019s thinking.\n\nIf anything, the call to bring the app stores into the fight is a response to the lack of action in Congress to pass online child safety regulations, like the hotly debated KOSA (the Kids Online Safety Act) leaving U.S. states to individually create laws due to a void of federal guidelines.\n\nUtah, for instance, passed a measure that will require social networks to give Utah parents access to their children\u2019s posts, messages and comments, and would block social media access during certain hours. The governor also signed a bill to prevent social media companies from adding features designed to addict minors to their platforms. A judge in Arkansas recently blocked a law that would have required parental permission for minors to create social media accounts.\n\nBeyond Meta, Montana also became the first state to ban TikTok, claiming it was being used by the Chinese Communist Party using TikTok to spy on Americans. But Meta\u2019s threat, in terms of teen usage, isn\u2019t one of a foreign power collecting private data on users, but rather risks to teen mental health, body comparison issues and exposure to sexual predators. Montana could easily turn its eyes to Meta next, after the TikTok bill went through.\n\nThe overhead of managing apps to meet individual state regulations would be a headache for Meta, but Davis also argues it would lead to a lack of teen protection, in some cases.\n\n\u201cU.S. states are passing a patchwork of different laws, many of which require teens (of varying ages) to get their parent\u2019s approval to use certain apps, and for everyone to verify their age to access them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTeens move interchangeably between many websites and apps, and social media laws that hold different platforms to different standards in different states will mean teens are inconsistently protected,\u201d Davis said.\n\nMeta\u2019s proposed \u201cbetter way\u201d of requiring parents to manage a teen\u2019s app downloads pushes the burden back to the app stores and to parents, who often today do not monitor or manage their teens\u2019 smartphone use. But while it\u2019s true that the app stores and smartphone makers would know the ages of their users, requiring parents to approve apps is the equivalent of overriding parental discretion and choice.\n\nOther entertainment ratings \u2014 like those for TV, movies or video games \u2014 are meant to be guidelines for parents, not laws. Meta\u2019s position that apps are somehow different, then, is a fairly extreme position to take.\n\n\u201cInstead of designing its products with kids\u2019 safety and privacy in mind, Meta would rather push blame onto parents and other companies to obscure the damage they\u2019ve already done to young people,\u201d said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, a nonprofit devoted to reigning in Big Tech, in reaction to the news. \u201cNo one disputes that Google and Apple need to do more to protect children on their platforms, apps and devices. That fact does not absolve Mark Zuckerberg or Meta for years of willful negligence, and this announcement shows that the company\u2019s outright hostility toward protecting kids is sewn into the fabric of its profit model.\u201d\n\nApple and Google did not return requests for comment.\n\nUpdated, 11/15/23, 4:40 PM ET, with comment from Tech Oversight Project."

They both were able to walk off.\n\nDolphins 17, Eagles 17\n\n10:23 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Watch out! Kader Kohou deflects a pass from Hurts and it's returned by Jerome Baker for a touchdown. That's a pick six, and the Dolphins have tied the game just like that after the no-call.\n\n10:22 p.m. \u2014 This looks more obvious than a certain penalty on James Bradberry from February.\n\nLooks like the refs missed another facemask, this one on James Bradberry pic.twitter.com/fYYeWnEWaGhttps://t.co/54oa1jfeHf \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) October 23, 2023\n\n10:20 p.m. \u2014 James Bradberry appears to get ahold of Cedrick Wilson's face mask on 4th & 3, but no flag flies. The Dolphins turn it over on downs.\n\n10:19 p.m. \u2014 Tyreek Hill just can't hang onto what would've been a big-time catch. It's not a fumble, but it is a fourth down for the Dolphins. They'll go for it.\n\n10:16 p.m. \u2014 Raheem Mostert is running wild. He rips off back-to-back runs of 21 and 15 yards, respectively, and the Dolphins are deep into Eagles territory just like that.\n\nRaheem Mostert moves the chains in back to back plays pic.twitter.com/cKtaJouqeZ \u2014 DIE-HARD \ud83e\udd85 Fans (@Eaglesfans9) October 23, 2023\n\n10:11 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles manage only one first down on the drive, and the Dolphins have a chance to get pretty strong field position after Philadelphia's first punt of the night.\n\n10:10 p.m. \u2014 Zach Sieler gets to Hurts and takes him down for a loss of three yards.\n\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles will be backed up deep in their own territory to start the next drive, but it's a big opportunity for Hurts and co. to stretch the lead back to two possessions.\n\n10:05 p.m. \u2014 Miami will punt from just past midfield, after a drive that started with some promise.\n\n10:04 p.m. \u2014 The Dolphins face 3rd & 18, largely the result of a holding penalty. Tagovailoa has already converted one of these tonight.\n\n10:01 p.m. \u2014 Raheem Mostert has struggled to get going, but he takes the Dolphins into Eagles territory with a solid 7-yard gain.\n\n10:00 p.m. \u2014 Hill picks up where he left off and goes 17 yards to give this Dolphins drive an early spark.\n\nEnd of first half: Eagles 17, Dolphins 10\n\n9:45 p.m. \u2014 Any hope the Eagles had of doing something before halftime ends with a Jaelan Phillips sack of Hurts. Philadelphia will go to halftime up 17-10.\n\n9:43 p.m. \u2014 Hill is up to 65 yards on eight catches. No other Dolphins receiver has more than two catches, and Hill now has 879 yards on the season.\n\nEagles 17, Dolphins 10\n\n9:39 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Tagovailoa hits Hill in the end zone for a touchdown! Hill was facing double coverage but simply beat both defenders. Miami has the deficit back to one possession.\n\n9:38 p.m. \u2014 Rookie Nolan Smith sacks Tagovailoa with 44 seconds remaining in the half.\n\n9:37 p.m. \u2014 The Dolphins are down to the Eagles' 29-yard line after catches by Braxton Berrios and Tyreek Hill. They have a chance to score on back-to-back possessions, as they get the ball out of halftime.\n\n9:33 p.m. TWO-MINUTE WARNING \u2014 Woah! Tagovailoa rescues a Dolphins drive that was headed in the wrong direction with a 29-yard pass to Cedrick Wilson. Great job by Wilson to keep both feet in after the grab.\n\n9:30 p.m. \u2014 Jaylen Waddle walked back to the locker room and is questionable to return with a back injury. Major blow for the Dolphins.\n\nEagles 17, Dolphins 3\n\n9:24 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Guess what play the Eagles ran on 1st & Goal from the one? Hurts gets tush-pushed in for the touchdown to put Philadelphia up big.The @Eagles Brotherly Shove their way to a 2-possession lead\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #MIAvsPHI on NBC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/0rIJPFKW6L pic.twitter.com/Izpm8KQDCA\n\n9:23 p.m. \u2014 What a fourth down play for the Eagles! Hurts comes under heavy pressure but gets away and finds A.J. Brown for what was initially called a touchdown. Instead, Philadelphia will be at the goal line looking to take a 17-3 lead.\n\n9:22 p.m. \u2014 Hurts is very fortunate to see Smith (and not a Dolphins defender) come down with a pass after he was hit during a throw.\n\n9:19 p.m. \u2014 DeVonta Smith with a nice catch on a dart from Hurts to take the Eagles into Miami territory. Aside from the one turnover, the Eagles are putting together long, sustained drives.\n\n9:15 p.m. \u2014 Julio Jones is on the board with his first catch as an Eagle. It's a three-yard gain for the future Hall of Famer.\n\n9:12 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles have the Dolphins' offense uncomfortable so far. Miami is punting after another Tagovailoa incompletion, and this will be a big moment for the Dolphins' defense.\n\nEagles 10, Dolphins 3\n\n9:06 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Happy National Tight Ends Day! Dallas Goedert with a great catch-and-run all the way into the end zone to give the Eagles the lead.\n\n9:05 p.m. \u2014 Christian Wilkins gets called for roughing the passer, pushing the Eagles right to the edge of the red zone.\n\n9:03 p.m. \u2014 On 4th & 1, you already know what the play is. Hurts gets two yards on a quarterback sneak to keep the Eagles' drive alive.\n\nEnd of first quarter: Dolphins 3, Eagles 3\n\n8:57 p.m. \u2014 DeVonta Smith has the Eagles into Dolphins territory after an eight-yard grab.\n\n8:56 p.m. \u2014 Boston Scott with a really nice return to set up the Eagles at their own 39-yard line.\n\nDolphins 3, Eagles 3\n\n8:52 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Dolphins can't capitalize on the opportunity, so Jason Sanders ties the game with a field goal.\n\n8:51 p.m. \u2014 A Tyreek Hill touchdown is erased by a holding penalty.\n\n8:50 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles have lost yardage on three different plays in this quarter, which doesn't seem sustainable. It'll be 3rd & Goal from the 12.\n\n8:48 p.m. \u2014 Jaylen Waddle goes airborne to bring down a Tagovailoa pass on third down and set up a 1st & Goal opportunity for Miami.\n\n8:46 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb get in there to knock the ball out of Hurts' hands! The Dolphins have an instant scoring opportunity just outside the red zone.\n\nBradley Chubb jars it loose and the Dolphins take over with great field position\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #MIAvsPHI on NBC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/0rIJPFKW6L pic.twitter.com/DDjWGEWofz \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 23, 2023\n\n8:44 p.m. \u2014 David Long is all over Hurts, quickly deflecting his second down pass. A key 3rd & 8 here for the Eagles.\n\n8:40 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles quickly force a punt after Tagovailoa's pass on 3rd & 15 falls short. So, neither of these explosive offenses start with a touchdown.\n\n8:39 p.m. \u2014 Haason Reddick swallows up Raheem Mostert for a five-yard loss to quickly set the Dolphins back.\n\n8:38 p.m. \u2014 Tyreek Hill is on the board with a 15-yard catch on a Tagovailoa pass.\n\nEagles 3, Dolphins 0\n\n8:33 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 Elliott connects from 24 yards out, and the Eagles strike first despite their promising drive fizzling out.\n\n8:32 p.m. \u2014 Eagles fans are unhappy after Philadelphia opts for three consecutive runs in the red zone. It'll be a field goal try for Jake Elliott.\n\n8:30 p.m. \u2014 Jalen Hurts is celebrating National Tight Ends Day by hitting Dallas Goedert on back-to-back passes for a total of 45 yards. The Eagles are into the red zone.\n\nFitting that the first big play of the game goes to Dallas Goedert on #NationalTightEndsDay\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #MIAvsPHI on NBC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/0rIJPFKW6L pic.twitter.com/DPfTTVQbnz \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 23, 2023\n\n8:28 p.m. \u2014 Swift has five touches already. No one else has seen the ball.\n\n8:26 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles are riding D'Andre Swift early, as the running back is up to three carries through three snaps. He gets Philadelphia a first down.\n\n8:23 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles will start the game with the ball, and we are underway!\n\n8:18 p.m. \u2014 As many have pointed out, Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts were once teammates and competitors at Alabama. Both have something to prove tonight, considering Hurts hasn't looked like himself for much of this season.\n\n8:10 p.m. \u2014 The Dolphins can open up a two-game AFC East lead on the Bills with a win tonight. Buffalo was upset by the Patriots earlier today.\n\n8:03 p.m. \u2014 Lincoln Financial Field has a new look for Kelly Green day.\n\nLincoln Financial Field, with a new logo and wordmark for this stadium: pic.twitter.com/vHEm7uBDgi \u2014 Zach Berman (@ZBerm) October 22, 2023\n\n7:55 p.m. \u2014 Oh yeah, Julio Jones is back in the NFL.\n\nWhat a group \ud83e\udd0c pic.twitter.com/fV9WgGOpRY \u2014 Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) October 22, 2023\n\n7:41 p.m. \u2014 Believe it or not, Tyreek Hill has a chance to break 1,000 yards tonight. He would need 186, but with the way he's played this season, that at least seems to be within reach.\n\n7:29 p.m. \u2014 Don't forget the Eagles will be back in Kelly Green tonight. This will be a fascinating uniform matchup.\n\n7:20 p.m. \u2014 It's 55 degrees and dropping in Philadelphia. That's not unusual for the Eagles, but will Tua Tagovailoa be able to rise to the occasion in cooler weather?\n\nWhat channel is Dolphins vs. Eagles on today?\n\nGame: Dolphins vs. Eagles\n\nDolphins vs. Eagles Date: Sunday, Oct. 22\n\nSunday, Oct. 22 TV channel: NBC\n\nNBC Live stream: Peacock | NBCSports.com | Fubo (U.S.) | DAZN (Canada)\n\nDolphins vs. Eagles can be watched on NBC, which has long held the broadcast rights to \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n\nMike Tirico (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (color analyst) will be on the call from Levi's Stadium while Melissa Stark will serve as the sideline reporter.

    "body": "The honeymoon period is over for Joshua Dobbs in Minnesota.\n\nThe folk hero quarterback threw four interceptions in the Vikings' 12-10 \"Monday Night Football\" loss to the Bears, leading a sluggish offense that didn't find its footing until the fourth quarter in a game that Minnesota wouldn't have needed many points to win.\n\nThe Bears' defense swarmed Dobbs throughout the night, sacking him only twice but bringing a great deal of pressure as the defensive backs made plays. Despite the barrage of turnovers, Chicago largely failed to take advantage. The Bears scored only three points off of the four Dobbs interceptions.\n\nMORE: How Joshua Dobbs got his 'Passtronaut' nickname\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago's first turnover of the night \u2014 a deflating fumble by Fields when the Bears had a chance to extend their lead to two possessions \u2014 was quickly turned into a touchdown by the Vikings. It looked like that score might be the difference, particularly after Fields fumbled away the ball again on the next possession, but the Bears' defense put the ball back in his hands in the final minutes. Fields delivered.\n\nFacing 3rd & 10 outside of field goal range, Fields hit an open D.J. Moore for a 36-yard gain. At that point, all the Bears needed to do was kneel and put Cairo Santos in position to win the game. Santos drilled the 30-yard attempt with 10 seconds remaining, and that would seal it for Chicago.\n\nMORE: Vikings playoff chances after loss to Bears\n\nAs he embarks on a crucial stretch that could determine his future with the Bears, Fields flashed the good and the bad. He was excellent on Chicago's opening drive, albeit one that ended without points, but missed throws and costly turnovers allowed the Vikings to hang around. When it mattered most, though, Fields was poised and sealed the Bears' first win over an NFC North opponent since 2021.\n\nWhile Chicago's hopes are still extraordinarily distant at 4-8, the Vikings saw their playoff chances take a hit on Monday night. Minnesota (6-6) dropped to the No. 7 seed in the NFC with the loss, with the Packers, Rams and Saints all just a half-game behind in the wild-card race. While a win would have put the Vikings in position to compete for the division crown down the stretch, just holding onto a playoff spot will now be a battle for Kevin O'Connell's squad.\n\nMORE: Latest updates on Justin Jefferson's return date\n\nThe Sporting News tracked live updates from the \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Bears and Vikings. Check out all of the key moments you might have missed.\n\nBears vs. Vikings final score\n\n1 2 3 4 F Bears 0 3 3 6 12 Vikings 0 3 0 7 10\n\nBears vs. Vikings results, highlights from 'Monday Night Football'\n\n(All times Eastern)\n\nFinal: Bears 12, Vikings 10\n\n11:07 p.m. \u2014 This game is OVER. The Bears don't score a touchdown and barely take advantage of the Vikings' four turnovers, but they walk out of Minnesota a winner as the Vikings fall back to .500.\n\nBears 12, Vikings 10\n\n11:04 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Bears are back in front! Santos drills it, and the Vikings have 10 seconds to work a miracle.\n\n11:03 p.m. \u2014 The Vikings are using their two timeouts, but there isn't much they'll be able to do once this hits fourth down. Once the Bears kneel it on third down, Santos will be running out for what should be an automatic field goal.\n\n11:01 p.m. \u2014 Fields hits Moore for 36 yards! That puts the Bears well into field goal range, and it's exactly what Chicago got Moore to do.\n\n11:00 p.m. \u2014 A pair of incompletions set up a crucial 3rd & 10 for the Bears. They're not in field goal range at the Vikings' 49.\n\n10:58 p.m. \u2014 Fields picks up a first down with his legs to take the Bears just over midfield. Chicago doesn't have timeouts, but there are still 85 seconds on the clock.\n\n10:55 p.m. \u2014 Fields hits Moore for a 16-yard gain on the first play of the drive, gathering some momentum for the Bears ahead of the two-minute warning. Chicago has plenty of time to sneak into field goal range.\n\n10:52 p.m. \u2014 Now it's the Vikings' turn to throw behind the line of scrimmage, which means it's the Vikings' turn to lose yardage. Minnesota passes on a long field goal attempt and instead will punt it away with 2:36 remaining and the lead just a point.\n\n10:49 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 Fields loses the ball AGAIN. Josh Metellus knocks it out for the second time, and this time Anthony Barr recovers. This has been an ugly, ugly sequence for the Bears.\n\n10:47 p.m. \u2014 Fields throws behind the line of scrimmage to Mooney, and Mooney is predictably dropped for a four-yard loss. That play call has not worked for the Bears in this half.\n\nVikings 10, Bears 9\n\n10:43 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 The Vikings turn the Fields fumble into the first touchdown of the night! Hockenson goes up and gets Dobbs' pass for the score. The Vikings lead, 10-9.\n\nThe first TD of the game is a Dobbs dot to Hockenson!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CHIvsMIN on ESPN/ABC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/J5tLNJHyh1 pic.twitter.com/b1IiFoqcqo \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2023\n\n10:41 p.m. \u2014 Dobbs hits Hockenson and pushes the Vikings into the red zone. Minnesota is driving. No one has scored a touchdown yet tonight.\n\n10:40 p.m. \u2014 Addison's catch stands, and an Alexander Mattison run has the Vikings at the edge of field goal range. They want more than three points, but it's early enough that they absolutely could settle for a field goal if it got to that point.\n\n10:37 p.m. \u2014 Matt Eberflus throws the challenge flag on a nice grab by Addison to give the Vikings a first down. This one looks like it will be tough to overturn...\n\n10:34 p.m. \u2014 Wow, Jordan Addison would've had a walk-in touchdown, but Dobbs' throw takes him out of bounds. Addison couldn't have been more wide open.\n\n10:33 p.m. \u2014 Brandon Powell has been the Vikings' biggest playmaker at two key points tonight. He goes 18 yards here to put Minnesota near midfield.\n\n10:29 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 That's exactly what CAN'T happen if you're the Bears. Fields loses the football, Sheldon Day recovers, and the Bears waste an opportunity to make this a two-score game.\n\nJosh Metellus forces a fumble and the Vikings take over \ud83d\ude24\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CHIvsMIN on ESPN/ABC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/J5tLNJHyh1 pic.twitter.com/fKnE0eTxsP \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2023\n\n10:27 p.m. \u2014 Fields finds Mooney for a big third down conversion as the Bears get firmly into field goal range.\n\n10:25 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Josh Dobbs throws his FOURTH interception of the night. Justin Jones nearly had it, but it was Kyler Gordon who came away with it. Everything the Vikings have done on the offensive side of the ball tonight looks like a chore.\n\n10:24 p.m. \u2014 A third down catch by Jordan Addison extends the drive for Minnesota. Addison only has 25 yards tonight.\n\n10:23 p.m. \u2014 Ty Chandler gets the ball on second down and gets nothing. Chandler has not looked very effective tonight with 11 yards on five touches.\n\nBears 9, Vikings 3\n\n10:18 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 After Santos missed from 48 earlier, he drills it from 55. It's 9-3, Cubs Bears.\n\n10:16 p.m. \u2014 Byron Murphy comes in to break up a third down pass by Fields, and Santos will come out for a long 55-yard field. He's already missed from 48 tonight.\n\nEnd of third quarter: Bears 6, Vikings 3\n\n10:14 p.m. \u2014 The Bears are starting to look respectable on third down again, this time completing to D.J. Moore to move deeper into Vikings territory. Chicago still might need another first down to give Cairo Santos a fair shot at a field goal.\n\n10:08 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Dobbs throws his third interception of the night! Jaylon Johnson deflected it, Edwards caught it, and interestingly, the Bears have less favorable field position than they would've if it had fallen incomplete.\n\nAnd Edwards follows it up with the Bears 3rd INT of the game \u203c\ufe0f\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CHIvsMIN on ESPN/ABC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/J5tLNJHyh1 pic.twitter.com/2d4C1s2O09 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2023\n\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 After a hold by Jaylon Johnson gifts the Vikings a first down, they still can't capitalize. Ty Chandler can't make T.J. Edwards miss on third down, so Minnesota will go for it on fourth down.\n\n10:02 p.m. \u2014 The running game is working, the passing game is not for the Vikings. Mattison has 19 yards three plays into this drive for Minnesota.\n\nBears 6, Vikings 3\n\n9:58 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 A questionable play call on third down as Fields throws behind the line of scrimmage to Moore, who gets nothing. Cairo Santos is able to extend the Bears' lead with a field goal, though.\n\n9:56 p.m. \u2014 Fields runs right up the middle for a first down and a bit more as the Bears look to get into field goal range (or better).\n\n9:54 p.m. \u2014 Roschon Johnson picks up a first down to keep the Bears' drive alive. He's looked impressive in spurts tonight.\n\n9:50 p.m. \u2014 Woah! Kevin O'Connell goes for it on 4th & 7, but Hockenson only gets six yards. The play looked good, the Bears' defense looked better. It's Chicago's ball with favorable field position.\n\nThe Bears defense comes up big with a 4th down stop\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CHIvsMIN on ESPN/ABC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/J5tLNJHyh1 pic.twitter.com/yndUqwgIbf \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2023\n\n9:47 p.m. \u2014 The Bears answer right back and sack Dobbs, with Sweat and Brisker in there to take him down.\n\n9:46 p.m. \u2014 Alexander Mattison has drawn the ire of Vikings fans all season, but he just got Minnesota's second half of to a booming start with a 21-yard run.\n\nEnd of first half: Bears 3, Vikings 3\n\n9:32 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 Greg Joseph drills it from 34 yards out, and this mess of a game is all tied at three entering the half.\n\n9:30 p.m. \u2014 The Bears' defense has suddenly morphed back into an elite unit on these last two plays, forcing intentional grounding by Dobbs and pressuring him heavily on the following play. It's 3rd & 24 for the Vikings, who might just settle for a gain of a few yards to set up the field goal.\n\n9:27 p.m. \u2014 Another first down by K.J. Osborn drives the Vikings into Bears territory, and the Vikings suddenly find themselves 13 yards from the end zone after Kyler Gordon is called for interfering with T.J. Hockenson. The Vikings have a chance to take the lead with 38 seconds on the clock.\n\n9:25 p.m. \u2014 What an effort by Brandon Powell to turn around and make a 28-yard grab while falling to the ground. That's the biggest offensive play of the night for the Vikings.\n\nA perfect catch from Brandon Powell on a perfect pass\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CHIvsMIN on ESPN/ABC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/J5tLNJHyh1 pic.twitter.com/f6FTBDH6rC \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2023\n\n9:22 p.m. \u2014 Fields had all day to find open receivers on third down and couldn't locate any. Chicago is 0-for-6 on its last six third down opportunities. The Bears are preparing to punt after the two-minute warning.\n\n9:19 p.m. \u2014 Fields hits Moore for a 22-yard gain, but his next pass is nearly intercepted by D.J. Wonnum. Neither offense has been able to string together positive plays since that opening drive by Chicago.\n\n9:16 p.m. \u2014 Dobbs is nearly intercepted by Jaylon Johnson (again) on third down. The last turnover wasn't Dobbs' fault, but this one should've been a pick. The Bears' defense is all over the Vikings tonight, and Minnesota can't get out of its own way.\n\n9:13 p.m. \u2014 Addison, trying to make up for the drop that turned into an interception, looks like he goes for 17 yards, but replay shows his knee was clearly down. It becomes a much smaller 4-yard gain.\n\n9:09 p.m. \u2014 Fields comes under pressure on third down and misses D.J. Moore. He's starting to miss these receivers after a hot start. Somehow, the Vikings will have a chance to tie this game or take a lead before halftime.\n\n9:04 p.m. \u2014 Dobbs is picked off again! That's two interceptions and just nine passing yards for the Vikings quarterback, but this one doesn't look like his fault - Jordan Addison saw it bounce off his hands. It's Jaquan Brisker with the pick.\n\n9:01 p.m. \u2014 Another penalty gifts the Vikings a first down... Both teams are piling on the mistakes.\n\n8:58 p.m. \u2014 A roughing-the-passer call goes against the Bears and gives the Vikings some breathing room early in the drive.\n\n8:54 p.m. \u2014 Fields overthrows Darnell Mooney on third down, and Mooney gets destroyed in a collision. The Vikings will get the ball back, still somehow only trailing by three. Fields will want that one back.\n\n8:50 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Jaylon Johnson intercepts a throw from Dobbs! That just hung up there. The Bears have been all over Dobbs and the Vikings' offense early on. A taunting penalty after the play hurts Chicago's field position.\n\nBears 3, Vikings 0\n\n8:44 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The drive fizzles out, and the Bears opt to kick the field goal on 4th & 3. It's good. The Bears are out to an early 3-0 lead, but they've left plenty of points on the board.\n\nEnd of first quarter: Bears 0, Vikings 0\n\n8:39 p.m. \u2014 What a play by Fields to get the ball to a wide open Kmet! The Vikings brought intense pressure, allowing Kmet to get wide open and go for 24 yards. The Bears are in business.\n\n8:38 p.m. \u2014 2nd & 22 becomes 2nd & 27, but the Bears make up 17 yards on two plays. It's 4th & 10, and Chicago is lining up to got for it.\n\n8:36 p.m. \u2014 Sacks are killing the Bears in this game. Multiple Vikings defenders wrap up Fields for a 12-yard loss and quickly set Chicago back to 2nd & 22.\n\n8:35 p.m. \u2014 The Bears' offense is picking up where it left off. After Fields takes off for 14 yards, he hits Roschon Johnson for 22 yards to take Chicago into Vikings territory.\n\n8:31 p.m. \u2014 That's what the Bears got Montez Sweat to do. Sweat sacks Dobbs on third down to force a quick three-and-out and get the ball right back in Fields' hands.\n\n8:27 p.m. \u2014 A great start for the Bears ends with zero points as Cairo Santos misses a 48-yard field goal. That's a deflating sequence for Chicago.\n\n8:25 p.m. \u2014 The rookie Ivan Pace Jr. finally gets to Fields and drops him for a five-yard loss. It'll be 3rd & long for the Bears.\n\n8:24 p.m. \u2014 Fields throws on the run to find Roschon Johnson for a first down, and he quickly follows up with a 13-yard pass to Khalil Herbert. The Bears are driving, and Fields doesn't have an incompletion yet.\n\n8:21 p.m. \u2014 The Bears have taken it into Vikings territory with a string of short gains. For Chicago, that's progress.\n\n8:19 p.m. \u2014 Fields finds Moore for a short gain and the first 1st down of the night.\n\n8:16 p.m. \u2014 The Bears will start with the ball on the road, looking to build early momentum.\n\n8:00 p.m. \u2014 Will the Josh Dobbs show continue tonight? He\u2019s had good command of the Vikings\u2019 offense in three games since a trade out of Arizona, flashing an especially strong connection with T.J. Hockenson.\n\n7:45 p.m. \u2014 It\u2019s 15 degrees in Minnesota with a feels like of 2, so the roof will come in handy tonight at U.S. Bank Stadium.\n\n7:25 p.m. \u2014 Vikings legend Adrian Peterson is in the building to watch his former team.\n\n7:17 p.m. \u2014 The Bears enter tonight with the No. 1 and No. 4 picks in the 2024 NFL Draft, and they'll remain in those slots with or without a loss thanks to the strength of schedule tiebreaker.\n\n7:10 p.m. \u2014 Heading into Week 13, tonight's game is the difference between the No. 6 and No. 7 seed for the Vikings. The ramifications could be much bigger than that, though. A loss would mean the Packers, Rams and Saints only trail Minnesota by a half-game in the wild card race, while a win would keep the Vikings well within striking distance in the NFC North.\n\n6:55 p.m. \u2014 D'Onta Foreman remains out for the Bears, along with CB Tyrique Stevenson.\n\n6:40 p.m. \u2014 There's no understating the importance of these final six games for Justin Fields, who is fighting to prove he's the Bears' franchise quarterback. Chicago has a strong chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft, thanks to the Panthers' ugly season.\n\n6:20 p.m. \u2014 The Vikings are officially without Justin Jefferson tonight, as they'll hold out their star receiver until they return from their bye in Week 14.\n\nVikings officially downgraded WR Justin Jefferson to out for tonight\u2019s game vs. the Bears. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 27, 2023\n\nWhat channel is Bears vs. Vikings on today?\n\nGame: Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings\n\nChicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings Date: Monday, Nov. 27\n\nMonday, Nov. 27 TV channel: ESPN\n\nESPN Live stream: ESPN+, Fubo (U.S.) | DAZN (Canada)\n\nBears vs. Vikings will be aired on ESPN, which has long held the broadcast rights to \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nJoe Buck will lead the broadcast, serving as the game's play-by-play announcer, with Troy Aikman serving as color analyst.

    "body": "NFL award longshots can be easy to overlook since each has a favorite(s). The longshot may be playing well, but other players have commanded the spotlight, making it easier for them to go unnoticed.\n\nWhatever the reason, they have not gotten the credit they deserve. However, with five weeks left in the regular season, there is plenty of time for a longshot to become a contender.\n\nBut if you wait too long before placing a bet, your payout will be a lot less than if you were to roll the dice on a longshot right now.\n\nLongshots to consider for NFL MVP, OPOY, DPOY, Coach of the Year and Comeback POY\n\nThere is always a reason why a player or several players have relatively short odds \u2014 they've been the best at their position throughout the season. Consequently, there is just as good a reason why longshots have odds as long as they do.\n\nSo, keep your bets small, or use a bonus bet (if you have one available), on longshots. If they do go on to win, smile all the way to the bank while you tell everyone, \"I told you so.\"\n\nRELATED: Best NFL Betting sites | How to bet on the NFL\n\nNFL MVP\n\nCurrent favorite(s): Brock Purdy , Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts\n\n, Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts Longshot(s): C.J. Stroud , Jared Goff\n\nThe MVP often ends up being someone, typically the quarterback, from one of the top-seeded teams. Hence, Brock Purdy, Dak Prescott and Jalen Hurts sit atop betting boards after Week 13.\n\nBut, by that logic, Jared Goff should be in the conversation. He has played well this season \u2014 his Lions are 9-3, poised to win the NFC South and in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference.\n\nCompared to the 49ers, Cowboys and Eagles, Goff and the Lions may have the easiest schedule to finish the season.\n\nBut bettors should also pay attention to C.J. Stroud. He leads the league in passing yards, is one of four quarterbacks eho have started the whole season with a passer rating over 100, and his touchdown to interception ratio is the best in the NFL (4 to 1)\n\nAs for the value of his play, Stroud has taken one of the worst teams in the NFL (11 total wins the last three seasons) and turned it into a playoff contender and potential division champion.\n\nOffensive Player of the Year\n\nCurrent favorite: Tyreek Hill\n\nLongshot: CeeDee Lamb\n\nThere's a good reason why Tyreek Hill is such a heavy favorite to win OPOY. The Dolphins wide receiver is on track to become the first player with 2,000-plus receiving yards in a single season.\n\nBut there is a solid chance he does not hit that mark. Of Miami's five remaining opponents, four have pass defenses ranked in the league's top eight. If he slows down, someone like CeeDee Lamb could catch up.\n\nBased on his current season average, Lamb is on track for close to 1,600 yards, but based on his production over the last seven games, he could finish with closer to 1,800 yards.\n\nHe will probably need Hill to fade down the stretch to have a shot. But if Hill does and he continues to produce, Lamb could steal OPOY from Hill.\n\nDefensive Player of the Year\n\nCurrent favorite(s): Micah Parsons , Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt\n\n, Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt Longshot: Danielle Hunter\n\nHunter leads the league in tackles for a loss and is third in sacks with 13.5 (behind Khalil Mack and Watt). Not only has he produced at a high level, but his play has been instrumental in the Vikings turning things around after a 1-4 start.\n\nHe may not have the name recognition that Parsons, Garrett and Watt have, but he has played as well, if not better, this season. If he can continue to produce, he at least deserves to be in the conversation, if not win.\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nCurrent favorite: Dan Campbell +200 (via DraftKings)\n\nLongshot: Sean Payton +2200 (via DraftKings)\n\nCampbell has done a tremendous job with the Lions, but it is fair to wonder if he's the betting favorite because of how well he has done his job this season or over the last two. This year, the team benefited from the groundwork laid last season.\n\nIf there were a reward for the best coach over two seasons, he would deserve it. As for this season, not so much.\n\nSean Payton should be at the forefront of the conversation. It's one thing to turn around a team that was dreadful last season. But he has taken one that got off to a horrible start and turned things around in-season.\n\nOh \u2014 and he has resurrected Russell Wilson's career.\n\nThat alone should put him at the top of the list, but he may need to get Denver into the playoffs to convince voters.\n\nComeback Player of the Year\n\nCurrent favorite: Demar Hamlin\n\nLongshot: Russell Wilson\n\nComing back from a life-threatening injury like a cardiac arrest makes Hamlin a great candidate to win CPOY. However, it would be understandable if voters were to look elsewhere since Hamlin has seldom been active on game day and rarely seen the field.\n\nIt will depend on how vital voters deem playing to be.\n\nWilson was supposed to be the next great franchise quarterback for the Broncos when they acquired him prior to last season. But rather than lead the team back to prominence, Wilson was terrible and so was Denver.\n\nThis season, Wilson has played well even when the Broncos have not. He is not producing mind-blowing stat lines, but he is keeping his team competitive, playing efficiently and not making many mistakes.\n\nUntil his three-interception day last week, he had the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the league. But even with those picks, his is still second-best."

    "body": "There will be many difficult decisions to be made in Week 16. It is the Fantasy Football semifinals in most leagues and there is a certain finality to every decision. There's no shortage of things to stress over as a Fantasy manager. Whether or not you start Rashee Rice shouldn't be one of them. While Rice is just WR29 on the season, that's mostly due to a slow start, and his hot start has pushed him into must-start, borderline top-12 territory.\n\nThe Chiefs' star rookie has four straight games with at least nine targets and he's scored at least 14 PPR Fantasy points in all of those games. Since Week 12, only Deebo Samuel and CeeDee Lamb have scored more PPR Fantasy points that Rice.\n\nOn paper, the matchup doesn't look great, because the Raiders have been above average in terms of limiting the Fantasy production of wide receivers. But this hot stretch started against the Raiders, when Rice scored 24.7 PPR Fantasy points against them in Week 12. They are playing a style of defense that limits big plays but allows throws underneath which fits Rice and his 4.3 ADOT perfectly. While the Raiders have surrendered the 11th-fewest passing yards this season, they've given up the fourth-most yards after the catch.\n\nIf Rice is on your roster, he's in your starting lineup. You have plenty of other things to stress about.\n\nHeath's Week 16 Previews: QB | RB | WR TE\n\n\n\nYou can find more in my weekly projections over at SportsLine.

His snap share has increased for three weeks in a row.\n\nWR Preview DFS Plays\n\nTop DFS Play (WR Preview) Projections powered by Sportsline CeeDee Lamb WR DAL Dallas \u2022 #88\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

The tiebreaker for me is that Lamb is $900 cheaper and Hill may still not be 100% by the time the Cowboys and Dolphins kick off. Last week was the first time since Week 9 that Lamb failed to reach the end zone and the second time since Week 5 that he didn't score at least 17 PPR Fantasy points.\n\nContrarian DFS Play (WR Preview) Projections powered by Sportsline Jaylen Waddle WR MIA Miami \u2022 #17\n\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

But there is at least a chance that Hill won't be 100% and Waddle will still be Tua Tagovailoa's top target. Waddle has been the quintessential DFS tournament play as of late with three of seven games over 19 PPR Fantasy points, topping 26 twice.\n\nWR Preview Heath's Projections\n\nMy full set of Week 16 Fantasy Football projections for every position are now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\u201cOften a really big mistake parents make is they impose the models of career success that were relevant when they were finishing school,\u201d says the 42-year-old father of three. Loading For instance, before the global financial crisis, he witnessed parents telling their children that the path to a stable and lucrative career meant getting a degree in finance and a job in banking. \u201cThen all those positions disappeared. It was stunning to watch.\u201d The idea that arts degrees are \u201cuseless\u201d is a fallacy, Grant adds. He points to a 2019 study suggesting parents pushed their children towards STEM degrees because they believed those careers would pay well. In the \u201csalary race\u201d, it is true that the science, technology, engineering and maths graduates earn more initially. But those who study history, English or social science degrees and are taught problem-solving, critical thinking and adaptability ultimately catch up, often surpassing their STEM contemporaries.\n\n\u201cParents may well push their kids in directions that seem to be really practical, but don\u2019t know what employers actually value,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThere\u2019s such a premium on the character skills or what some people call soft skills or behavioural skills: communication, teamwork, leadership.\u201d Soft skills, a term that originated in the 1960s from US Army psychologists tasked with developing proficiency in soldiers beyond the literal \u201chard skills\u201d of working with weapons and machines, are becoming increasingly important in a world where technology may replace other jobs. Adam Grant has advice for parents who want to help their kids reach their potential. Grant recounts chatting with a \u201cvery influential person in tech\u201d, who told Grant it was impossible to plan a career more than a couple of years ahead \u2013 when he graduated from university, the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk hadn\u2019t yet finished school. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t predict what kinds of companies were going to exist, and we didn\u2019t know what kinds of jobs were going to exist,\u201d he says.\n\nNow, generative AI is upending work in brand-new ways and inevitably changing the future of work and jobs yet again: \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully arrogant to assume that you can tell your kids what a stable career looks like.\u201d By directing our kids down a path that is not of their choosing, there are several likely outcomes, Grant suggests. \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully arrogant to assume that you can tell your kids what a stable career looks like.\u201d Adam Grant They fail to thrive, or burnout because they end up in a job that is not aligned with their values, interests and skills; they resent you; or they rebel and deliberately do the opposite. How, then, can parents support their children to achieve their potential?\n\nPotential is not innate, it\u2019s developed Seeing natural talent in others can make us discount our own \u2013 or our kid\u2019s \u2013 abilities in a certain area, as can admiring someone at their peak without considering how far they\u2019ve come. Loading Yet in Grant\u2019s book, he illustrates the experiences of those whose potential was not immediately obvious \u2013 including his own. Though Grant eventually became a diver on the junior Olympic team, when he first tried out for his school diving team, it seemed like a hopeless pursuit. The coach told him that the sport required grace and flexibility, but that Grant walked like Frankenstein, couldn\u2019t touch his toes, and the coach was quite sure his grandmother could outjump him.\n\nSimilarly, though he has become a New York Times bestselling author three times, he failed the mandatory writing test in his first year at Harvard and was instructed to do a remedial writing course \u2013 one reserved for \u201cjocks and international students who spoke English as a fifth language\u201d. \u201cA lot of people believe passion is out in the world waiting to be discovered,\u201d Grant tells me. \u201cIf you can just turn over the right stone you\u2019ll find the thing you love.\u201d \u201cParents may well push their kids in directions that seem to be really practical, but don\u2019t know what employers actually value,\u201d says Grant. Credit: Janie Barrett It\u2019s hard to enjoy something when we find it hard, or we are failing. But progress can be a result of passion, just as passion is an outcome of progress. \u201cToo often what we do is take on a new hobby or skill or task and say, \u2018Oh this is not fun, it\u2019s not for me\u2019, as opposed to saying, \u2018I\u2019m not good at this yet, let me see once I get a little better if I like it\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn both writing and diving, he focused on his own growth and progress and relied on the guidance of credible mentors (in Grant\u2019s case, his diving coach, who was ultimately his greatest champion, and teachers who knew him well and believed in his capacity to be a great writer). Loading How do you know if you\u2019ve achieved your potential? We often look to extrinsic rewards \u2013 titles, money, awards \u2013 as the metrics of success. But, Grant argues: \u201cThey are status symbols that we use to broadcast to others and to ourselves that we matter and I think they are really poor proxies for mattering. I think we have all been in situations where we can admire people not for what they\u2019ve achieved but for who they\u2019ve become or what they\u2019ve contributed to others.\u201d"

HERE'S HOW TO SELECT THE PERFECT ONE FOR YOU\n\n\"Aside from the time I asked my husband to turn our bathroom into a Hallmark movie and he actually pulled it off, unrealistic expectations around Christmas usually just set up moms for inevitable disappointment,\" Keeley said.\n\n\"Beautiful family Christmas memories can be made without the drive-in \u2018Grinch\u2019 movie, the tacky light tour and the neighborhood Christmas cookie bake-off all in the same weekend.\"\n\nInstead, parents should \"take it easy and leave plenty of room to relax,\" said Keeley.\n\n2. Using Christmas as a bribe\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy for parents to use a message of \"be good or else\" as a parenting tactic before Santa Claus comes down the chimney, Keeley said this approach lowers parenting standards.\n\n\"I refer to this tactic as \u2018stooping to Santa,\u2019\" she said. \"Don\u2019t lower your parenting standards to bribery, especially around a season and a character that is supposed to symbolize peace and goodwill on Earth.\"\n\nThe Santa bribe turns the focus of Christmas into \"selfish gain on the part of your children,\" Keeley added.\n\n\"Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s also lazy parenting, which never pays off in the long run,\" she said. \"Being a mom is a professional career and deserves to be treated accordingly.\"\n\nShe added, \"Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline.\"\n\n3. Becoming a \u2018holiday martyr\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep the holidays well-rounded, Keeley said.\n\n5 HOLIDAY DECORATING MISTAKES THAT COULD REDUCE YOUR CHEER THIS YEAR\n\nShe called out \"martyr moms\" who are at their \"peak performance\" during Christmastime, putting everyone else before themselves.\n\n\"They wear themselves out making sure everyone else has the perfect Christmas, but never put themselves on the receiving end,\" she said.\n\nThese parents, said Keeley, \"subconsciously compensate for a lack of self-worth and validate their role as a [parent] by creating too much busyness in their life.\"\n\nShe said that \"all that results from a mom who runs herself into the ground is just that: a mom who runs herself into the ground.\"\n\nDELICIOUS CUT-OUT SUGAR COOKIES FOR CHRISTMAS: TRY THE SIMPLE RECIPE\n\nShe added, \"If this is you, take a breath, put away the to-do list and ask yourself, \u2018What would I have to believe in order to have a relaxed and joyful Christmas?\u2019 Maybe we can use that as a guide to sit back and relax.\"\n\n4. Griping like the Grinch\n\nParents should be sure not to be \"grinchy\" around their kids amid holiday stress, Keeley said.\n\nChildren up to the age of 9 process information egocentrically, she said \u2014 which means if there\u2019s a problem, they see themselves as the cause.\n\nWith this in mind, parents should avoid \"processing their frustration around the holidays audibly around the children,\" she said.\n\n\"The \u2018mom brain\u2019 is wired to process problems rapidly and move on to solutions,\" she said. \"The \u2018child brain,\u2019 however, is wired to process a problem internally and take on the responsibility.\"\n\nSaid Keeley, \"Knowing this, make sure you don\u2019t do any \u2018grinchy griping\u2019 out loud to the children. You may see it as temporary venting, but they see it as, \u2018Mom is upset and I\u2019m probably the reason.\u2019\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nInstead, parents should stay calm, find a reason to be grateful and vocalize it, even when frustrations accumulate.\n\n5. Neglecting the \u2018give list\u2019\n\nWhile building a wish list is fun for kids, Keeley emphasized the moral importance of the \"give list.\"\n\n\"Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a \u2018wish list\u2019 and get what they want,\" she said.\n\n\"Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a \u2018wish list\u2019 and get what they want.\"\n\n\"This is loads of fun, but can often create a big case of 'the gimmes\u2019 in your children.\"\n\nShe added, \"Life is balance. It\u2019s about receiving and giving.\"\n\nAs parents guide their kids to create a wish list, Keeley encouraged them to spend equal time creating a list of gifts to give to family and friends.\n\n\"Collaborate with them on what they want to give to the people they love, and encourage them to use their imagination and creative ability, not just your credit card,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Even if it's a pine cone covered in peanut butter and bird seed for loved ones to use as a bird feeder, the gift came from the heart and a beautiful lesson was learned \u2014 that\u2019s the best Christmas gift of all,\" she said."

    "body": "Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.\n\nIt's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.\n\nWe'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.\n\nIt's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings our broken down by position available on SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jaleel McLaughlin RB DEN Denver \u2022 #38\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ KC KC -10.5 O/U 47 OPP VS RB 6th PROJ PTS 11.8 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 160 REC 7 REYDS 46 TD 3 FPTS/G 9.3 There isn't a Broncos running back you'll have much confidence in starting because they'll all split the proverbial pie too much. I'd start McLaughlin over Williams, but I would rather start Brian Robinson, Alexander Mattison, Rachaad White, Jerome Ford and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nLAST WEEK: Despite splitting first-half snaps almost evenly and losing out on second-half snaps considerably, McLaughlin made three splash plays of 21, 22 and 38 yards including a touchdown on a tipped-then-secured designed screen that pierced through the middle of the Jets defense. Those three touches were his best -- his other nine touches each failed to exceed 3 yards. And as mentioned two sentences ago, he played just 10 snaps in the second half when the Broncos were trailing.\n\nFILM: McLaughlin has good vision and speed, both of which were essential in reading the Jets defense at the first and second levels and choosing the correct paths to run on his big plays. His lateral agility was a differentiator on his touchdown catch. McLaughlin's worst asset is his power as he just won't finish runs with physicality like his backfield mates do. But the biggest detriment is that he can't consistently overcome bad blocking, which has been a consistent problem for the Denver O-line all year and certainly something that impacted Javonte Williams in his first handful of games.\n\nWHEN TRAILING: When the Jets were up by eight or more points in the second half, McLauglhin played 4 of 15 snaps and had two carries. That's in line with a trend we've seen from Denver all year: Of the 117 snaps they've played when down by eight or more points, McLaughlin has played 26 snaps (13 touches, seven at Chicago), Williams has played 27 snaps (15 touches, almost all against Miami) and Samaje Perine has played 58 snaps (13 touches) -- more than both backs combined. The only guy who's averaged a strong number on the ground in this specific situation? You guessed it -- McLaughlin (6.1 yards per carry).\n\nCHIEFS: Tend to build leads on their opponents. They also have given up just four rushing plays of 12-plus yards this season, and that includes a fake punt run by the Vikings last week. Kansas City has given up one rushing TD to a running back this season. Impressive numbers considering they're giving up 4.5 yards per carry and rank in the bottom-10 in yards before contact and yards after contact. The secret? Teams don't run the ball that much against them (16.4 attempts per game, fourth-fewest) because ... they tend to build leads on their opponents.\n\nCHIEFS: David Montgomery and Alexander Mattison are the only two running backs to tally at least 10 Fantasy points (PPR or non-PPR) against Kansas City this year. Both scored.\n\nBRONCOS: When McLaughlin, Williams and Perine were all part of the Broncos game plan in their Week 3 blowout loss, Williams had the most work (13 touches) and the most PPR points (8.5). The only time a Denver back had 15-plus touches came in Week 1 when Williams had 17 against the Raiders (and had 9.7 PPR points, a season-high).\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nFlex Starter in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zay Flowers WR BAL Baltimore \u2022 #4\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ TEN BAL -4 O/U 41 OPP VS WR 28th PROJ PTS 12.3 WR RNK 28th YTD Stats REC 29 TAR 40 REYDS 317 TD 0 FPTS/G 12.5 If I had supreme confidence in Baltimore not having much success on the ground then I'd start Flowers without hesitation. But Tennessee's run defense has weakened a bit and the Ravens could be apt to take advantage. Of course there's upside for Flowers to haul in a couple of long targets, and that really is what keeps him in the flex conversation. But I would rather start Christian Kirk, Marquise Brown, Michael Pittman and Jakobi Meyers as WR2 options this week.\n\nSneaky Sleeper in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Justice Hill RB BAL Baltimore \u2022 #43\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ TEN BAL -4 O/U 41 OPP VS RB 14th PROJ PTS 7.5 RB RNK 29th YTD Stats RUYDS 115 REC 7 REYDS 25 TD 3 FPTS/G 9.3 It's a little gutsy to go with Hill, who has been inefficient for much of the year. We're counting on the Ravens outsmarting the big size of the Titans defensive line and utilizing Hill for his speed along the edges and in the passing game. His high-value touch share is the icing on the cake and hopefully can lead to him scoring just over 12 PPR points for the second week in a row. I'd take my chances with him over low-upside running backs like Gus Edwards, Antonio Gibson and Jonathan Taylor (for now he's low-upside).\n\nLAST WEEK: I surmised that Flowers would be targeted more if the Ravens run game couldn't get going. Sure enough, it didn't, and Flowers saw a season-high 11 targets at Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Flowers underwhelmingly caught just five balls for 73 yards with two drops that would have pushed his yardage over 100 had he held on to both targets.\n\nAIR YARDS: Flowers was targeted downfield more last week than in any game this season with a 15.27 Average Depth of Target (ADOT). It was the first time he had a double-digit ADOT and more than six targets. He lined up wide on the majority of snaps (66.7%) and hitches were still his route of choice but there was more diversity there than before. It's also notable Flowers did this while sharing the field with Odell Beckham and Rashod Bateman back on the field.\n\nTITANS: Run defense started the season strong but got smashed last week by Zack Moss and the Colts to the tune of 6.3 yards per carry and four explosive runs (they had allowed two total headed into the game). Moss beat a stacked box on his 56-yard TD scamper. And even when Richardson wasn't on the field the Colts averaged 4.7 yards per run against Tennessee.\n\nTITANS PAST TWO: Against the Bengals and Colts, the Titans allowed at least 2.79 yards before contact per rush in each game and were decimated by zone-scheme runs (at least 6.0 rush yards per carry by RBs).\n\nRAVENS RUN GAME: Have called zone runs half as many times as power runs even though they average a half-yard better per carry on zone runs. They'd be smart to do more of that this week against Tennessee. Hill has the team's best rushing average and highest rush EPA on zone runs.\n\nHILL: In the three games he's played the most snaps in (Weeks 1, 2 and 5), he's played 24 of a possible 43 third-down snaps (56%) and 14 of 20 snaps inside the 10. He's smaller than Gus Edwards, but faster and more versatile, and it's given him extended opportunities for high-value touches.\n\nTITANS PASS DEFENSE: Rank in the bottom-five in catch rate allowed to outside wide receivers (75.8%) but handle them well otherwise (12.5 yards per catch, 3.34 YAC/reception are both top-10). They're equally adept versus hitch routes and WR screens, Flowers' two most-run routes. Tennessee has allowed exactly 50% of pass attempts of 15-plus Air Yards to all wide receivers be completed for a bottom-five yards per catch allowed rate, but they're league average in YAC/reception and touchdowns allowed on those throws, and the numbers are a little bit better for them if you discount four hiccups in Week 1.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Terry McLaurin WR WAS Washington \u2022 #17\n\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS WR 6th PROJ PTS 12.1 WR RNK 37th YTD Stats REC 25 TAR 31 REYDS 261 TD 1 FPTS/G 11.4 The only two games McLaurin posted good numbers in were Washington's 35-33 win over Denver in Week 2 and Washington's 34-31 OT loss to Philadelphia in Week 4. This matchup has an over/under of 42.5 points, tied for fourth-lowest of the week. Tack on the ascending secondary the Falcons seem to have and the Commanders' diffusion of targets and McLaurin is at best a low-end flex. I'd rather roll the dice on Drake London, Tyler Lockett or Garrett Wilson.\n\nLAST WEEK: Hopeful that his target edge over his teammates would keep growing, and even in a favorable game script where the Commanders were trailing by three scores before halftime, McLaurin only saw five targets against the Bears' heavy zone coverage.\n\nFILM: On the 10 third-down routes McLaurin ran last week, he drew extra coverage on four of them, got open on two of them (Howell threw elsewhere) and was a decoy on Curtis Samuel's touchdown. What happened? Sam Howell was getting rid of the ball quickly and to shorter distances as the Bears were getting some pressure on him. By the end of the game McLaurin's body language seemed dispirited.\n\nCOMMANDERS: Throw to their wideouts on 58.7% of their targets, which is below league average (but not as bad as, say, the Falcons at 36.4%). What makes that number worse is that McLaurin has just one more target (31) than Jahan Dotson (30), who has three more targets than Curtis Samuel (27). They're all nearly even after five games and each of them has had a turn leading in targets at least once.\n\nFALCONS: Are expected to play a heavy dose of zone coverage, if only because the Commanders have struggled to be explosive against zone coverage this year. Atlanta also gave a full dose of snaps last week to outside cornerback Jeff Okudah, who wasn't flawless but does offer another sizable body to help against stronger perimeter receivers. Between Okudah and A.J. Terrell there isn't a matchup that's great for McLaurin.\n\nMcLAURIN: Has an impressive 91.3% catch rate versus zone coverage this year, but is averaging just 9.3 yards per catch with it on a sub-9.0 ADOT. His target share is below 20% regardless of the kind of coverage he sees.\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Logan Thomas TE WAS Washington \u2022 #82\n\nAge: 32 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS TE 31st PROJ PTS 8.4 TE RNK 11th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 25 REYDS 183 TD 2 FPTS/G 11.6 Streaming Thomas is worth the risk considering how the Falcons have let up numbers to tight ends. The Commanders clearly value the position in their offense, Thomas sees the most throws from Howell, and if Atlanta plays heavy zone coverage then it should mean a bunch of underneath throws for Thomas to take in. You're hoping for at least seven targets here, which is possible. He's worth the nod over Jake Ferguson, Dalton Schultz and Tyler Conklin, and it's close in full PPR over Kyle Pitts.\n\nLAST WEEK: Thomas was a big-time benefactor of the Commanders chasing points against Chicago's heavy zone coverage, seeing 10 of his 11 targets once the Bears built a 17-point lead in the first half. A 24-yard catch on the final play of the first half against prevent defense didn't hurt either.\n\nFALCONS: See the third-most targets per game to tight ends (9.0) which in turn has made them bottom-five in raw stats like total catches and yards allowed. But they float around league average in catch rate allowed (77.8%, below league average) and yards per catch (8.9, better than league average). However, no team has allowed more first-down receptions to tight ends (17). Keep in mind, this defense hasn't seen tight ends better than Evan Engram, Sam LaPorta or Dalton Schultz.\n\nCOMMANDERS: Throw to their tight ends on 26.3% of their throws, fourth-most in football. But that hasn't always meant a huge target share for Thomas. In Weeks 1 and 5 he saw at least 22.9% of Sam Howell's targets. He left Week 2 after suffering a concussion and was absent in Week 3; then was not part of the game plan much in Week 4 (7.7% target share against Philadelphia). Perhaps it's all health related and Thomas' volume from last week will stick.\n\nZONE COVERAGE: Atlanta usually plays a lot of zone coverage early on and if it works they stick with it for the whole game (Week 5 was an example of that). In Weeks 3 and 4 against the Lions and Jaguars they played much more man coverage, especially when they needed a fourth-quarter turnover. And because Howell is much less explosive against zone looks, I expect the Falcons to stick with zone much more this week.\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Kyle Pitts TE ATL Atlanta \u2022 #8\n\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs WAS ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS TE 10th PROJ PTS 10.3 TE RNK 9th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 32 REYDS 208 TD 0 FPTS/G 7.8 If last week had been Week 1 then I would have been encouraged by Pitts' performance and would probably keep expectations high. But we've seen four really measly weeks from Pitts before Week 5, so forgive me for not rushing back to him as a must-start tight end. The truth is that the matchup is a little tougher for him and for Ridder, plus teams have beaten the Commanders on deep shots to wide receivers, not lumbering tight ends, so I'm not convinced Pitts will maintain his target share or develop more explosive plays. He's still worth trotting out there over Logan Thomas, Dallas Goedert and Cole Kmet, but keep expectations around 70 yards on six catches.\n\nLAST WEEK: Came alive against the Texans' zone-heavy defense with season-highs in targets (11), catches (seven) and yards (87). This was his second game of his last three where his target share was over 23%. It was nice to see him as a key part of the offense, but I can't help but notice he played a season-low 53% of the snaps.\n\nFILM: Two things helped Pitts out: One, he looked a little quicker off the snap and a little faster when running straight. He's still lumbering when he changes directions in his routes but perhaps he's slowly getting healthier. Two, Desmond Ridder seemed very comfortable throwing into tighter windows to Pitts in zone coverage as the two had some good timing down, mainly on dig and out-breaking routes.\n\nPITTS: Continues to harvest a high ADOT -- last week it was 11.36 yards and on the season it's 11.72, the highest among all qualifying tight ends. He also has the lowest catch rate (56.3%) and worst YAC/reception average (1.33 yards) among all qualifying tight ends. Of his 208 yards, just 24 have come after the catch.\n\nCOMMANDERS: Play zone coverage at a slightly lower-than-league-average rate, typically turning to man coverage as soon as games get sideways (like in the second quarter last week or the fourth quarter against the Bills). Opponents average 32.0 pass attempts per game against them, ninth-fewest in football, and against tight ends that line up in the slot or out wide like Pitts, the Commanders rank among the top-five in yards per catch, YAC/reception and have yet to allow a reception of 20-plus yards.\n\nDEEP PASSES: The Commanders have allowed the seventh-most receptions of throws that traveled 15-plus Air Yards this season with 19. Of those 19, only two were caught by tight ends (Cole Kmet, Dallas Goedert) and neither went for more than 23 yards.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline K.J. Osborn WR MIN Minnesota \u2022 #17\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ CHI MIN -2.5 O/U 44.5 OPP VS WR 20th PROJ PTS 10.7 WR RNK 33rd YTD Stats REC 13 TAR 26 REYDS 166 TD 2 FPTS/G 8.3 No doubt there's some potential here, but some hunches keep me from falling for Osborn this week. One: I think the Vikings will try to get their run game going since they don't have Justin Jefferson. Two: Jordan Addison is far more explosive and T.J. Hockenson has been a much more relied-upon weapon. They should have more targets than Osborn. And the expected zone coverage Chicago will play further will limit Osborn unless he sees more targets than expected. He has more upside than Jerry Jeudy, Jahan Dotson and Tutu Atwell but I'd rather take a shot on Drake London, Terry McLaurin or Chris Godwin.\n\nLAST WEEK: Over 19 snaps without Justin Jefferson last week, Osborn ran 18 routes and caught both of his two targets for 30 total yards. The receiving average was delightful, but the small-sample target share (12.5%) was saddening. What's funny is that Osborn's target share was much higher when Jefferson was playing (23.3%) but his receiving average tanked (6.3).\n\nFILM: Osborn didn't beat coverage with his speed last week and his burst and agility were just OK. His 22-yard catch came on a Kirk Cousins scramble where he waited in a spot and Cousins hit him, then Osborn ran inside instead of outside where he might have been able to score. He also ducked under an end-zone target instead of leaping for it. It's worth noting that a 36-yard crosser he ran against the Chargers flies in the face of this as he separated from man coverage with speed and technique, then turned upfield and ran outside before racing past a defender and diving for the pylon.\n\nOSBORN: Has a 50% catch rate on the year and that includes whether he faces zone coverage or man coverage. He sees more targets per route run against man coverage and averages more yards per catch and yards after catch against man coverage. Over his career, targets do seem to come more frequently against man coverage and he has been more explosive with them.\n\nBEARS: Play zone coverage at the fourth-highest rate of any defense this season (79.2%). And because Cousins is much more explosive of a passer against man coverage, expect Chicago to keep up their zone defense.\n\nHISTORY: In 20 career games with at least five targets, Osborn has scored at least 12 PPR points in 13 of them. Eleven of those 13 involved him catching a touchdown. Osborn has two career games with over 100 yards -- and one came last January at Chicago.\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Cole Kmet TE CHI Chicago \u2022 #85\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs. If you start Kmet, you're buying into his role as Fields' change-up to D.J. Moore -- and in the case of this week, a change-up to the Bears' depleted run game. I especially like his red-zone role and his touchdown opportunities. I'm ready to chance it with Kmet over Kyle Pitts, George Kittle and Dallas Goedert.\n\nLAST WEEK: Kmet kept rolling as Justin Fields' second-favorite target, turning five throws into a 5-42-1 stat line versus a Commanders defense that had shut down the Cardinals, Bills and Eagles tight ends to start the season.\n\nPAST TWO GAMES: Really since the Bears told Chase Claypool to take a hike, Kmet has become a focal point of the offense. He's averaged seven targets per game with a 24.6% target share to go along with four red-zome targets and three end-zone targets. He's second to D.J. Moore in all of those categories except red-zone targets, where he's first -- and by a lot (no one else has more than one, including Moore).\n\nBEARS: May need Kmet as a short-area target to help make up for some of the run game as the Bears are expected to not only be without Khalil Herbert but also rookie Roschon Johnson. In an effort not to overwork their backs, who won't have it easy against the Vikings, Kmet could handle more short-area throws than normal. His ADOT over the past two games has been 7.64, which isn't far from his season average of 6.69.\n\nVIKINGS: Allow the fewest yards per catch to rival tigh ends (5.9 yards), even keeping a lid on Travis Kelce last week (6.7 yards per catch). But they've also seen the fourth-lowest ADOT from tight ends (5.0 yards per target), almost as if teams know they won't be able to succeed on downfield shots against them (zero completions of 20-plus yards from tight ends). These numbers are tough but if Kmet gets the target volume we've seen him have over the past couple of weeks he can still put up palatable numbers. And, tight ends have scored three times in the Vikings past three games.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nFlex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Tyler Lockett WR SEA Seattle \u2022 #16\n\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ CIN CIN -2.5 O/U 45 OPP VS WR 11th PROJ PTS 11.9 WR RNK 36th YTD Stats REC 17 TAR 27 REYDS 157 TD 2 FPTS/G 11.7 If you start Lockett, you're doing it for his upside and on the hope that Smith can have a minor resurgence against man coverage. It may also come to pass that the Seahawks are trailing in the game and thus have to throw. Consider Lockett more of a top-30 receiver who you should sit for Zay Flowers and Gabe Davis but start over Chris Godwin, Nico Collins, Garrett Wilson and Drake London.\n\nBENGALS: Consistently tailor their defensive coverage to the weaknesses of the offenses they face. So when a quarterback struggles against zone coverage, they'll play more zone. This worked in their favor in all but one game this year (Ravens, Week 2). Cincinnati also has turned on the juice for their pass rush, getting a pressure rate of over 40% in each of their past three games, all versus teams with suspect offensive lines.\n\nBENGALS: Are expected to be without top cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, and they also are rotating one of their safety spots between Nick Scott and Jordan Battle. D.J. Turner is expected to replace Awuzie.\n\nGENO SMITH: Has a 47.8% completion rate and a lowly 4.1 yards per attempt average against man coverage so far this season. He's also barely thrown deep (4.3% of his attempts went 20-plus Air Yards). A huge reason for the low numbers is because his pass protection has been dreadful. The anticipated return of left tackle Charles Cross should help him have more time, which in turn helps his receivers.\n\nOUTSIDE WRs: Have caught just 50% of their targets against the Bengals this season, third-lowest in football. However, when those receivers have caught the ball they've averaged 17.9 yards per catch, which is the third-most in the league. The Bengals defense has really only let up big games to receivers who catch touchdowns.\n\nLOCKETT: Already the team leader in target share for the season, Lockett sees more targets on a route-run basis against man coverage (28%) compared to zone (21%). He also does better with them, averaging a full 2.0 more yards per catch and with a much higher explosive play rate (14.3% compared to 5.0% against zone).\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jeff Wilson RB MIA Miami \u2022 #23\n\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 6 yrs.

Remember, Wilson's injury was to his abdomen, not his legs, so there might not be much of a limit on how much work he'll do (though it's unlikely he'll have a ton of touches). I'd take my chances with him over Samaje Perine, Jerick McKinnon and Antonio Gibson.\n\nWILSON: Started practicing this week after being sidelined with finger and abdomen injuries since late August. He and his fresh legs are back just in time as rookie sensation De'Von Achane hit Injured Reserve this week with a knee injury.\n\nDOLPHINS: Aren't quite the bastion of rushing that some headlines have made them out to be, but they're just over league average in rush rate at 43.7% and above league average in RB runs per game at 22.6. All of these numbers are weighted heavily by their 50-point win over Denver in Week 3 when they ran the ball 42 times with their running backs. Their 7.6 yard per carry average is due to Achane's breakout start more than anything else.\n\nMcDANIEL: Prefers to use two running backs from game to game, and in Miami's past three games there's been a relatively close split in carries between two backs (18 and 13 in Week 3, 8 and 7 in Week 4, 11 and 10 in Week 5).\n\nLAST YEAR: Wilson was efficient in his eight games in Miami, averaging 4.7 yards per carry with three touchdowns and just over 60 total yards per matchup. That includes two games he barely played in (under 20 snaps) -- take those out and he averaged 78.2 total yards per game.\n\nSALVON AHMED? Was a healthy scratch last week and figures to be no better than a special-teams player this week. In fact, in the seven games Raheem Mostert, Wilson and Ahmed were all active for with the Dolphins last year, Ahmed played 18 offensive snaps and 25 special-teams snaps. Wilson played 213 offensive snaps and 10 special-teams snaps.\n\nPANTHERS: Rank in the bottom five against running backs in rush yards per carry allowed (5.2), rushing touchdowns allowed (right), explosive run rate allowed (9.8%), yards before contact per rush allowed (2.26). Every running back with at least 10 carries against the Panthers this season has posted at least nine non-PPR points. There's been one every game, but multiple running backs have had 10-plus non-PPR points in two games through five weeks.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zack Moss RB IND Indianapolis \u2022 #21\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

It's purely a hunch but because Taylor is still ramping up and it takes as many as four weeks to \"get right,\" Moss should lead the way and could see as many as 15 touches. I'd start Moss as an RB2 over Rhamondre Stevenson, Emari Demercado and Taylor.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jonathan Taylor RB IND Indianapolis \u2022 #28\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

I'd view Taylor as at best a bye-week replacement with an eye on his Week 9 matchup at Carolina as his breakout game.\n\nLAST WEEK: The Colts eased Jonathan Taylor back into action after sitting out the first four games and barely practicing at all. He played just 16% of the snaps to Zack Moss' 80%, and Moss handled nearly every third down, fourth down and snap inside the 10-yard line. Of note, Taylor played just three second-half snaps.\n\nFILM: Taylor looked as big and strong as I remember, and he wasn't shy about contact at all. I liked how he fought for yardage on pretty much every carry. He did seem rusty when it came to processing his blocking and figuring out where to run -- it felt more like he ran up the backs of his linemen more than scan for space to make cuts and elude defenders. It was a good first step.\n\nFILM: Moss, meanwhile, had consistently great vision and used his combination of speed and power to crash through the Titans' front, especially when they stacked the box against him on his 56-yard touchdown run. There's nothing to suggest Moss is struggling, which means his playing time doesn't figure to dwindle.\n\nTHIS WEEK: Colts coach Shane Steichen said he's ramping up Taylor's workload in practice, and the official team website believes Taylor's snap share will increase both this week and as the season goes on. But Moss still figures to be the lead back and handle a majority of high-value touches.\n\nJAGUARS: Last week's showing against a Bills run defense that was disinterested in running the ball helped push their run defense numbers to new heights. On the season they've given up one touchdown on the ground, 3.6 yards per carry, a 6.0% explosive run rate and 2.27 yards after contact per rush to running backs. Only the explosive run rate doesn't register among the top-six across the league.\n\nStart Him In PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Michael Pittman WR IND Indianapolis \u2022 #11\n\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

It also helps the cause that the Jaguars aren't exactly terrible against the run (3.6 yards per carry allowed), meaning that the Colts can't easily dominate on the ground for four quarters. He's best as a low-end WR2 in PPR leagues but no better than a flex in half- and non-PPR. For example, I'd start Zay Flowers, Tyler Lockett and Amari Cooper over Pittman in non-PPR, but not in PPR.\n\nWEEK 1: Came alive in the second half against the Jaguars and finished with a season-high 97 yards on eight catches with a well-documented 39-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown.\n\nSINCE WEEK 1: Has been above 14 PPR points once (Week 3 at Baltimore, a game Gardner Minshew started). Over the past two weeks Pittman has totaled just 12 targets against the Rams and Titans for six catches and 67 yards. It's a far cry from Week 1.\n\nMINSHEW: Clearly more of a developed downfield thrower than Anthony Richardson and has thrown at Pittman on 26.4% of his routes run including four red-zone targets and an end-zone target. Even last week when Minshew played less than a half Pittman saw a target once every five routes he ran with Minshew.\n\nJAGUARS: Rank fifth with a 77.7% zone coverage rate, and they've consistently played a lot of zone in every game. They were also busted up by outside receivers (over 17.0 yards per catch) last week against Buffalo and two weeks ago against the Texans. Pittman tends to play outside more than in the slot. Finally, an outside receiver has scored at least once against the Jags in every game this season, including Pittman back in Week 1.\n\nPITTMAN: Tends to do better against zone coverage than man, though he was much better last year than this year. This year he's actually been about even in catch rate and yards per catch against man and zone coverage but does have a higher explosive play rate against zone (9.7% compared to 6.7% against man). That tracks back to last year, by the way -- his explosive play rate was nearly twice as high against zone than man.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nFlex Starter In PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Nico Collins WR HOU Houston \u2022 #12\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

Unfortunately, neither of his matchups are particularly favorable. I could see Collins getting a lot of short targets and for that reason alone I'd be OK starting him as a flex option in PPR ahead of Tyler Lockett and Chris Godwin, but behind Jakobi Meyers, Jaylen Waddle and Gabe Davis.\n\nLAST WEEK: Even in a game where the Texans lost Tank Dell to a concussion before the half, Collins couldn't get much going. That included in the second half when he saw one target and couldn't catch it. He definitely wasn't shadowed by anyone and was almost never double-teamed, though there were a couple of routes where a safety was in proximity. It could have had more to do with the Texans attacking the middle of the field against the Falcons' zone coverage.\n\nSAINTS: Have played the fifth-fewest snaps of zone coverage this season and have ignored tendencies some quarterbacks have had through the early portion of the season. It's just what they like to do. Stud cornerback Marshon Lattimore has not followed receivers much this season, playing 87% of his snaps at right cornerback (to the left of the quarterback). Their other primary outside corner, Paulson Adebo, has allowed a 50% catch rate on the season with minimal YAC.\n\nCOLLINS: It's minor but Collins does see a higher target per route run rate against man coverage (25%) than zone (22.2%). He also has a higher catch rate (87.5%) and higher receiving average (23.3) against man than zone (65.4% and 17.8). However, he's run nearly four times as many routes against zone coverage compared to man.\n\nMATCHUPS: It's also worth pointing out that Collins' two really big games came in Week 2 (vs. Indianapolis) and Week 4 (vs. Pittsburgh), both teams that rank in the bottom-10 in Fantasy points allowed to wide receivers. The Saints are in the top half.\n\nSTROUD: Has been outstanding against man coverage all year, completing a higher rate of passes (67.6%) for 3.5 more yards per attempt (11.1) than versus zone (7.6). However, he is nowhere near as impressive when he's pressured, completing 48.1% of his throws for a weak 4.3 yards per attempt.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Brock Purdy QB SF San Francisco \u2022 #13\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

The Cowboys wound up paying the price through the air for playing a ton of zone coverage instead. It was suggested by a friend that they didn't want to get burned by long runs by Christian McCaffrey. I guess that worked. The combination of the 49ers defense running hot and the Browns offense figuring to get stuffed should make for at least a game script for Purdy to have decent numbers. I'm not making the mistake again of benching Purdy -- I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Geno Smith and Jared Goff.\n\nLAST WEEK: Took on one of the toughest pass rushes in football and slayed them for four touchdowns on just 24 pass attempts. Of his seven incompletions, one was dropped, two were batted at the line of scrimmage, another was a throwaway and two more were defensed. Purdy was off-target on 0.0% of his throws.\n\nFANTASY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 9 of his 10 regular-season starts, and it really should be 10 for 10 because of a touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 10 of 12 games. And in six of those 10 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past three games.\n\nBROWNS: Have played the least amount of zone coverage snaps of any team in football this season, and they've done it consistently. There isn't a game this season where they've played even 65% of zone coverage snaps, and there have been only three quarters when they've called more than 70% of their snaps in zone coverage. Plus the Browns just saw the Cowboys play 90% of their snaps in zone coverage and Purdy cooked them like BBQ chicken.\n\nPURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but five of his seven passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 50% of his throws for 6.7 yards per attempt with a gaudy 15.9% off-target rate. These stats are actually better than they were last week.\n\nBROWNS: Rank third in pass rush pressure rate at 41.5% and blitz at an above-average 29.3% rate. Granted, the Cowboys ranked higher than that last week and got beat anyway.\n\nLAMAR JACKSON: Faced the Browns in their last game, saw a ton of man coverage and was pressured a bunch and he still threw two touchdowns and completed 79% of his throws for 9.8 yards per attempt. And he did it without his starting left tackle and two of his top receivers. His defense turning over an ill-prepared Browns offense helped a bunch.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jerome Ford RB CLE Cleveland \u2022 #34\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

In PPR you can hope for another game with five catches, which honestly isn't a stretch since he just had one against a good defense two games ago. Maybe he's good enough to start as an end-of-the-barrel RB2, but I'd feel better going with Rachaad White, Alexander Mattison or D'Onta Foreman.\n\nSINCE CHUBB GOT HURT: Ford has averaged 4.3 yards per rush and 7.7 yards per catch with three total touchdowns (including the catch he had on the play after the Chubb injury). His 69-yard cross-field run at Pittsburgh has certainly helped his numbers out; without it he has zero touches of 20-plus yards and his only run for more than 10 yards came with a holding penalty.\n\nSNAPS: Ford has yet to dominate snaps at running back for the Browns, playing right around 60% in Weeks 3 and 4. In fact, Ford does not have more than 14 touches in a single game since taking over for Chubb, but it's been just two games.\n\nHERE COME THE 49ERS: On the year they've held enemy running backs to 3.7 yards per carry with an explosive run rate of 1.7% (which somehow is only second-best in football). The only rush defense metrics they're not top-five in are Defensive Rush EPA (just below league average), yards before contact per rush (0.88 yards, they're sixth), yards after contact per rush (2.80, just above league average). They even lead the NFL in fewest missed tackles. Tony Pollard had an 8-29-0 rushing stat line against them last week.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THROUGH THE AIR? Even though the 49ers see the fifth-most RB targets per game, they're better than league average in catch rate allowed (75%) and top-10 in both yards per catch (5.7) and YAC/reception (6.10) allowed to running backs. Pollard caught 4 of 5 passes for 35 yards last week.\n\nP.J. WALKER: Has thrown 17.2% of his career pass attempts to running backs. For 2023, the NFL league average of QB throws to running backs is 18.2%, so he's just below the current league average.\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Amari Cooper WR CLE Cleveland \u2022 #2\n\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs. If you start Cooper, you should not only have lower expectations but basically pray to the Fantasy Gods for some garbage production or ludicrous target volume. It's hard to trust Cooper to come through for a reliable stat line, and there's a lot of downside for a single-digit-point week. He's at best a low-end No. 3 receiver; I'd rather start Tyler Lockett, Chris Godwin or Drake London.\n\nLAST GAME: With rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson at quarterback, Cooper saw six targets and caught one for 16 yards. Half of the six targets were uncatchable. In his previous three with Deshaun Watson he had at least seven targets in each, and at least 16 PPR points in the past two.\n\nSINCE THEN: Watson hasn't practiced with the team. P.J. Walker was named the starter despite being on the team's practice squad and took reps this week in preparation for their game against the Niners.\n\nWALKER: Was cut by the Bears after the preseason before linking up with Cleveland. Has five career passing touchdowns in 15 games (seven starts). He's had multiple passing scores in one NFL game. Only twice has a receiver had 100 yards from Walker (both by D.J. Moore, once in 2020, once in 2022). Two other times has a WR had at least 70 yards (Curtis Samuel in 2020, Terrace Marshall in 2022). In his NFL career, Walker has thrown specifically to wide receivers on 71.2% of his throws, which basically the only good thing you can take away from this paragraph.\n\nCOOPER: In effectively 30 career games without Dak Prescott, Derek Carr or Deshaun Watson on the field (meaning he played with a backup), Cooper has 13 touchdowns (seven from Brissett) and seven with 100-plus yards (four with Brissett). More importantly, Cooper had at least 15 PPR points in 13 of the 30 games (six with Brissett), so 43% of the time.\n\nBRISSETT VS WALKER: Comparing their play over the past four seasons, Brissett had a considerably higher completion rate (63% to 57.5%) with a lower interception rate (1.7% to 4.8%) and lower off-target rate (10.3% to 18.9%). Brissett didn't throw downfield as much as Walker, contributing to a higher ADOT for Walker, but not by much (8.8 to 8.3). Both quarterbacks were right around 6.5 yards per pass attempt.\n\n49ERS: Oh yeah, the matchup isn't great. No team allows fewer yards per catch to wideouts than the Niners (9.7), and they're thrown at a ton by offenses that have to play from behind. Only three receivers -- Puka Nacua (20 targets), Marquise Brown (10 targets) and Michael Wilson (two touchdowns) have had more than 15 PPR points against them. And only one other receiver -- Tutu Atwell (nine target) -- had more than 12 PPR points.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Rhamondre Stevenson RB NE New England \u2022 #38\n\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

Some might say dumping Elliott and giving more work to Stevenson would make sense, but Elliott actually has a higher rushing average and better before/after contact rates than Stevenson does! Maybe the Patriots will turn to another running back in hopes of finding anything that can help take pressure off of their depleted passing game. I can't recommend Stevenson as a start until we see proof of him playing well -- a favorable road matchup alone isn't enough. I'd rather start Jerome Ford, Zack Moss and D'Onta Foreman.\n\nLAST WEEK: Was the first time Stevenson did not have 16 or more touches in a game. He had eight carries and no receptions. He also played a season-low 50% of the snaps but did handle 10 of 16 snaps on third/fourth downs. Stevenson started and played the first two series, then Elliott started off the next two series, but they rotated in and out for each other the whole game. Elliott continued to be the Patriots RB of choice in the two-minute offense to end the first half.\n\nSTEVENSON: Nothing has changed in terms of his efficiency. We can blame the offensive line to some degree but Stevenson has averaged 0.97 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 30th out of 41 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.79, which is dead last among those same 41 qualifiers.\n\nEXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.\n\nRECEIVING: Is averaging 3.6 targets per game and catching 67% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.\n\nPATRIOTS: Have run one (1) play inside the opponents' five-yard line this entire season. That should help explain the lack of touchdowns for Stevenson.\n\nRAIDERS: Rank in the bottom 10 versus RBs in yards per carry allowed (4.3) and yards after contact per rush allowed (3.04). But they're also in the top-10 in most rush attempts by RBs faced (24.4 per game) and they've given up just three rushing touchdowns and an explosive run on 4.9% of their snaps (that's actually 10th best). And would you believe only one running back has scored more than 15 PPR points against the Raiders this season? It's James Cook.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Emari Demercado RB ARI Arizona \u2022 #31\n\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ LAR LAR -7 O/U 48.5 OPP VS RB 10th PROJ PTS 11.6 RB RNK 20th YTD Stats RUYDS 48 REC 6 REYDS 40 TD 1 FPTS/G 4.2 A likely split of work with Ingram could not only cost Demercado some carries, but Ingram's big size (6-0, 220) could put him at the goal line if the Cardinals can somehow get there. Think of Demercado as a candidate for 10 PPR points and perhaps four non-PPR points. I'd rather start both Colts RBs, Javonte Williams and Chuba Hubbard if Miles Sanders is out.\n\nLAST WEEK: After James Conner left with an injury, Demercado played 100% of the Cardinals snaps. They could have used veteran RB Corey Clement to help him out but kept him on special-teams duty. And Demercado actually played fairly well, flashing solid speed and physicality on his runs with some patience blended in. He's not as big as Conner but he played kind of like him.\n\nTHIS WEEK: Arizona released a depth chart with second-year back Keaontay Ingram as the first stringer. It is expected that Ingram will work with Demercado in the Cardinals backfield this week.\n\nINGRAM: Through 15 regular-season games over two years, Ingram has averaged 1.9 rush yards per carry. His career-long run is 13 yards. This past preseason Ingram did rock for 4.4 yards per run but no carry went more than 11 yards. His 2022 preseason wasn't better than his 2023 preseason.\n\nTHIRD DOWNS: Demercado has worked as the Cardinals third-down guy since Week 2, playing 74% of those snaps. He's also had some reps in their two-minute offense. It's not a stretch to say he's been Arizona's passing downs RB. That should remain as part of his role moving forward. But honestly, unless Ingram gets a hot hand early, Demercado should be given a chance to work running downs too.\n\nRAMS: Have taken a step forward as a decent run defense. In their past three games, they're holding running backs to 3.6 yards per carry and are better than league average in yards before and after contact as well as in missed tackles. A rival running back has 13-plus PPR points in three of their past four games, but each of those backs had at least 20 touches. No one looks like even a 12-touch back for the Cardinals.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jared Goff QB DET Detroit \u2022 #16\n\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs.

But the Buccaneers defense deserves some credit for holding up against their opponents. Plus, Goff's two big games came against bad secondaries and suspect pass rushes. This one is a little tougher. I think Goff is good enough to start ahead of Trevor Lawrence, Sam Howell and Geno Smith, but I would put Matthew Stafford and Brock Purdy ahead of him.\n\nLAST WEEK: Even without two of his most explosive targets, Goff exploited the Panthers defense for 236 yards and four total touchdowns on 28 pass attempts. And in the one specific area where you might have thought David Montgomery would have gotten the ball -- inside the 5 -- Goff threw two of his scores and dove for another.\n\nBUCCANEERS: Have been zone-heavy in three games but went man-to-man in an attempt to get back into their game against the Eagles in Week 3 and couldn't help their cause. That's their only loss on the season. The Bucs also blitz at the third-highest rate in football (41%) but even so they don't get a ton of pass rush pressure on the quarterback.\n\nGOFF: Has proven to be a little bit better against man coverage than zone this season, but his stats against both coverages are just fine (his QB rating against both are over 105 each). He has a better TD rate and attacks downfield a little more when he sees zone coverage. As for when he's blitzed, Goff's completion rate is sensational either way (over 68%) but naturally he has better numbers when he is not blitzed. The difference is noticeable but not detrimental.\n\nROAD WOES: I have to bring it up even though I don't like bringing it up -- since arriving in Detroit, Goff has topped 20 Fantasy points (six points per passing touchdown) twice in 16 road games.\n\nBUCCANEERS: Only one quarterback, Jalen Hurts, has posted over 20 Fantasy points this season on the Bucs.

I do think volume will be in his favor, so counting on him for close to 16 PPR points (half that in non-PPR) is fair. That gives him flex appeal over Nico Collins and Tyler Lockett, but not over Jakobi Meyers, Zay Flowers or Gabe Davis.\n\nLAST WEEK: Coming off the heels of what felt like a step in the right direction, Wilson couldn't take advantage of a favorable matchup against the Broncos. He led the Jets in targets (seven) but was second behind Tyler Conklin in catches and yards. Wilson's 26.9% target share was a season low. Getting shadowed by Patrick Surtain on all but one of his targets didn't help, nor did having a pass bounce off his hands within five yards of the end zone.\n\nZACH WILSON: Was off-target on 15.4% of his throws for the second consecutive week even though he had a higher completion rate (73.1%) and passing yard average (7.7 yards per attempt). It's a byproduct of Wilson attempting just 26 throws after putting the ball up 39 times the game before.\n\nUNCATCHABLE: Of the 43 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 14 of them (33%) have been uncatchable.\n\nEAGLES: Have let up a slew of receiving numbers by virtue of seeing so many passes thrown against them (27.4 targets per game just to wide receivers). So naturally they rank in the bottom five in catches allowed, YAC allowed and touchdowns allowed. But on per-target metrics they're doing all right. A 60.6% completion rate allowed is 10th-best, 11.4 yards per catch allowed is seventh-best and 4.06 YAC/reception is on par with the league average.\n\nPASS RUSH: As overworked as the Eagles secondary has been, their pass rush has been solid. Against soft O-lines in Washington and L.A., the Eagles have put pressure on at a rate of 37.6% and have blitzed 33.3% of snaps. Given the state of the Jets offensive line after losing guard Alijah Vera-Tucker to a season-ending injury, it wouldn't be a surprise if the Eagles were to spook Zach Wilson frequently, leading to shorter throws, off-target throws and sacks.\n\nLET'S DO MATH: If the Jets are forced to throw much more than they did last week, say it's 39 times, then roughly 30% of those targets will go to Garrett Wilson. That's 12 targets. That's great. But of those 12, one-third figure to be uncatchable, meaning that we're looking at eight receptions at best for Wilson. And even though Wilson is averaging 8.7 yards per catch on the season, he deserves the benefit of at least 10.0 yards per catch since the Eagles are allowing 11.4 yards per catch to receivers. So maybe he can deliver just past 15 PPR points. Not too shabby.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Darren Waller TE NYG N.Y. Giants \u2022 #12\n\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 7 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ BUF BUF -14 O/U 44.5 OPP VS TE 4th PROJ PTS 10.2 TE RNK 7th YTD Stats REC 23 TAR 34 REYDS 239 TD 0 FPTS/G 9.4 Waller is a safe bet to lead the Giants in targets, but everyone in the stadium will know it. That includes the Bills, who could easily drape a second defender near him to force the Giants quarterback (whoever it is) to throw elsewhere. Waller is a low-end starter in the same range as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet -- and only ahead of them because of the volume we're hoping he gets.\n\nLAST WEEK: Waller was a focal point of the Giants offense and caught 8 of 11 targets for 86 yards at Miami. Four of the targets came from Tyrod Taylor (for 3-31-0), all in the fourth quarter. That was a 33% target share just from Taylor. And Waller could have had a bigger game as he was close to corralling some deep targets from Daniel Jones.\n\nTAYLOR: Has a career target rate of 22.4% to his tight ends, which is real nice. As recently as 2020 he leaned on Hunter Henry while with the Chargers, and even in two of his hey-day years with the Bills did he work tightly with Charles Clay. He shouldn't be a detriment.\n\nTHIS SEASON: Waller has the highest target share on the G-Men, but it's 20.8%. His ADOT also sits at 8.9, and both that number and the target share got lifted up by the Giants' decision to force-feed targets to Waller last week. He also ran more downfield routes than we're used to seeing. If the Giants stick with this then Waller can meet some of his lofty expectations. But I think if Brian Daboll had it his way he'd try to find explosive plays from all of his receivers and spread the ball around.\n\nBILLS: Got their first test against tight ends last week in Evan Engram and swarmed him -- he caught 4 of 8 targets for 28 yards. He is used similarly to Waller, which makes Buffalo's game plan for slowing Waller down easy to carry over this week. Their pass rush should also impact the Giants passing game and may force Waller to run shorter routes so he gets open quicker.\n\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\n\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Dak Prescott QB DAL Dallas \u2022 #4\n\nAge: 30 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ LAC DAL -2.5 O/U 51 OPP VS QB 21st PROJ PTS 18.9 QB RNK 15th YTD Stats PAYDS 1061 RUYDS 45 TD 5 INT 4 FPTS/G 13.8 Trusting Prescott is a tall task, even in what looks like a favorable matchup. The Cowboys might pivot to a slower approach with Tony Pollard handling the run game more than he has been over the past couple of games. That could take pressure off of Prescott, but it doesn't mean he'll unload statistically. I'd rather start Sam Howell, Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford.\n\nLAST WEEK: A nightmare scenario as Prescott tried to get aggressive on downfield throws early and missed until he hit KaVontae Turpin for a 26-yard touchdown. Then Prescott HAD to throw deep to try and climb back into the game and got sloppy on two of his interceptions (a third bounced off of Michael Gallup's hands). He didn't even play the last 12 minutes of the game and the Cowboys got blown out.\n\nTHIS SEASON: Prescott's completion rate is fine (69.4%) and his off-target rate is low (8.1%). So what's the problem? Prescott's ADOT is 6.5, ranking 28th among 33 qualifying quarterbacks. He's actually second-to-last in pass attempts of 10-plus Air Yards; only Daniel Jones has thrown fewer. And the scary part is that his ADOT was over a yard lower (5.4) going into last week's game, so the Cowboys tried to let him air it out and the plan completely backfired.\n\nO-LINE: It's possible that injuries that go as far back as to Week 2 along with some declining play from Tyler Biadasz and Terence Steele could be contributing factors for Prescott's low ADOT. He doesn't want to get hit, so he's getting the ball out as fast as he can. Even against the 49ers he sped up his motion and overshot those targets. He's just not as comfortable and the offense isn't adjusting well enough.\n\nCHARGERS: Traditionally play a good amount of zone coverage but have changed it up more often this season and used more man-to-man, including versus Miami in Week 1. But despite some headliners in the front seven and 16 sacks in their past three games, the Chargers rank fourth-worst in pass rush pressure rate at 29.5% this season. They also blitz at about the league average rate. In theory this should not be a difficult matchup for Prescott, but\n\nKELLEN MOORE: Prescott's QB coach and/or playcaller for the prior five seasons will be coaching the Chargers offense on Sunday, but he's sure to have spilled the beans on Prescott's tendencies. We've seen offensive coordinators come back to wreck their old teams all the time and could see it again on Sunday.\n\nFANTASY: The only quarterback to not get at least 22 Fantasy points against the Chargers was Raiders rookie Aidan O'Connell."

    "body": "Brock Purdy threw for 314 yards and four touchdowns, Deebo Samuel scored three TDs and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was checked for a concussion in the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 42-19 win over Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\nThe fiery NFC championship game rematch also featured 49ers\u2019 touchdowns on six straight possessions and a pair of ejections that showed this year\u2019s title game may not run again through Philly, after all.\n\n49ers' Dre Greenlaw has been disqualified from tonight's game after this incident on the Eagles sideline. pic.twitter.com/2N4W17N8u9 \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 3, 2023\n\nThe 49ers (9-3) left Philly 10 months ago battered in the NFC championship game behind injuries to Purdy and his backup, and they never stood a chance in a 31-7 loss. The 49ers spent an offseason chirping at the Birds \u2013 Samuel called one Eagles cornerback \u201ctrash\u201d \u2013 and then entered the Linc as a rare betting favorite against a 10-win team at home.\n\nThe Eagles (10-2) suffered a scare when Hurts jogged off the field in the fourth and went straight to the locker room. He was cleared to play and returned to action with about 10 minutes left. It was not immediately clear when Hurts was injured.\n\nBy the time last season\u2019s NFL MVP runner-up returned, the Eagles trailed 35-13 and were on their way toward their first home loss of the season. Hurts did hit DeVonta Smith for a two-yard TD on his return drive. He finished 26-of-45 passing for 298 yards. Purdy put the finishing touches on the win with a 46-yard TD to Samuel.\n\nPerhaps all that braggadocio paid off for the 49ers. Hard feelings spilled into the game, highlighted by a scrap in the third quarter that got 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw and the the Eagles\u2019 chief security officer tossed.\n\nDom DiSandro, a constant presence on the Eagles\u2019 sideline, pulled Greenlaw off Smith after a reception. Greenlaw popped up and reached over two officials to touch DiSandro\u2019s face with a closed fist. Greenlaw was ejected. DiSandro, a cult hero in Philly for his ever-present backup when Eagles are out in public, also was told to leave and walked to the locker room to a roaring ovation.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers 6-0 New England Patriots\n\nJustin Herbert threw for 212 yards and set up a pair of Cameron Dicker field goals that were all the Los Angeles Chargers (5-7) needed for their first shutout in six years. Keenan Allen came back from a thigh injury to catch five passes for 58 yards. But the only scoring the Chargers could manage was a pair of 38-yard field goals in the second quarter. New England made a quarterback switch, benching Mac Jones in favor of Bailey Zappe. But the Patriots (2-10) still lost their fifth straight game. For the first time in franchise history, the Patriots have been shut out at home twice in a season. Zappe was sacked five times \u2013 two by Khalil Mack, giving him a career-high 15 for the season and 99 in his career. Zappe was 13 for 25 for 141 yards; he did avoid an interception for the first time in three games, the previous two in relief of Jones.\n\nTyreek Hill had two touchdowns among his 157 yards receiving to help the Miami Dolphins rout the Washington Commanders 45-15. The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De\u2019Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington\u2019s Sam Howell threw a pick-6 for a third consecutive game.\n\nDetroit Lions 33\u201328 New Orleans Saints\n\nSam LaPorta had career highs of nine catches for 140 yards, including an early touchdown and a crucial first-down snag in the final minutes, and the Detroit Lions beat the reeling New Orleans Saints. Detroit improved to 9-3, their best record through 12 games since they went 10-2 in 1962. The Saints lost quarterback Derek Carr in the fourth quarter to back, shoulder and head injuries. Carr was hurt on a penalized hit by Bruce Irvin. New Orleans fell to 5-7, behind first-place Atlanta in the NFC South.\n\nKansas City Chiefs 19-27 Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Green Bay Packers picked up their fourth win in five games as they beat the defending Super Bowl champions. The 6-6 Packers are now in the NFC wildcard places after Sunday night\u2019s win.\n\nDenver Broncos 17-22 Houston Texans\n\nNico Collins had a career-high 191 yards receiving and a fourth-quarter touchdown, and Jimmie Ward intercepted Denver\u2019s Russell Wilson in the end zone with nine seconds left to left to help the Houston (7-5) Texans hold on for a win over the Broncos. Ward leapt in front of intended receiver Lucas Krull to secure the fourth victory in five games for Houston and snap a five-game winning streak for Denver (6-6). Wilson was intercepted a season-high three times, all of them after halftime. Derek Stingley Jr had the first two picks for the Texans. Rookie CJ Stroud threw for 274 yards for Houston.\n\nIndianapolis Colts 31-28 Tennessee Titans\n\nGardner Minshew threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Michael Pittman with 2:31 left in overtime and the Indianapolis Colts (7-5) beat the Tennessee Titans (4-8) for their fourth straight victory. The Colts had to score a touchdown after Nick Folk made a 46-yard field goal with 4:19 left in overtime to put Tennessee up. Tennessee lost their first true home game this season and have yet to win consecutive games. The Titans blew a 17-7 lead. Nick Folk missed his first extra point this season with 5:26 left in regulation, which would have put Tennessee up 26-25.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Free weekly newsletter Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De\u2019Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington\u2019s Sam Howell threw a pick-six for a third consecutive game.\n\nAtlanta Falcons 13-8 New York Jets\n\nDesmond Ridder threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to MyCole Pruitt and the Atlanta Falcons took over sole possession of first place in the NFC South by slogging their way to an ugly victory over the punchless New York Jets.\n\nThe Falcons (6-6) have back-to-back wins for the first time since opening the season with victories over Carolina and Green Bay. Atlanta entered tied atop the division with New Orleans, who lost to Detroit.\n\nBut this game appealed only to fans of sloppy play, punting and penalty flags. The Jets (4-8) got an early safety but couldn\u2019t get anything going \u2013 again \u2013 on offense in losing their fifth straight game. New York even pulled quarterback Tim Boyle and replaced him with Trevor Siemian in the fourth quarter to try to provide a spark, but it was more of the same misery in what appeared a half-filled MetLife Stadium.\n\nCleveland Browns 19\u201336 Los Angeles Rams\n\nMatthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes, Puka Nacua became the first Rams rookie wide receiver to reach 1,000 yards in a season, and Los Angeles extended their winning streak to three games. The Rams have won three straight for the first time since winning the Super Bowl after the 2021 season. At 6-6, they are back in the playoff race after dropping three straight before their bye week. Joe Flacco was 23 of 44 for 254 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in his Browns debut. Cleveland fell to 7-5 and occupy the final playoff spot in the AFC.\n\nArizona Cardinals 24\u201310 Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nJames Conner ran for 105 yards and a pair of touchdowns against his old team as the Arizona Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the Cardinals\u2019 first win at Pittsburgh since 1969. Arizona took control late in the first half with a 99-yard touchdown drive that ended with a five-yard strike from Kyler Murray to Trey McBride. The Cardinals led the rest of the way, enduring a pair of lengthy delays due to severe weather. The Steelers lost starting quarterback Kenny Pickett to an ankle injury late in the first half and scored their only touchdown in garbage time.\n\nCarolina Panthers 18\u201321 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nTampa Bay\u2019s Mike Evans scored on a 75-yard reception and joined Jerry Rice as the only players in NFL history to string together 10 consecutive seasons with 1,000-plus yards receiving. Evans finished with seven receptions for 162 yards, increasing his season totals to 61 catches for 1,012 yards and 10 touchdowns. Rice has the league record of 11 straight seasons with more than 1,000 yards receiving. The Bucs won for only the second time in the past eight games. Carolina scored late to pull within a field goal, but No 1 overall draft pick Bryce Young threw an interception to end any chance of coming from behind to win in the Panthers\u2019 debut under interim coach Chris Tabor."

    "body": "Tessa Wullaert\u2019s brace fired Belgium to a dramatic 3-2 home win over England in League A1 of 2023-24 UEFA Women\u2019s Nations League.\n\nWullaert equalised for Belgium in first-half injury time before she took advantage of Georgia Stanway\u2019s handball to fire in a 85th minute winning penalty.\n\nLaura De Neve earlier had curled the hosts ahead in the ninth minute before a serious collision between Alex Greenwood and Jassina Blom halted play in the 18th minute. whilst quick-fire goals from Lucy Bronze and Fran Kirby after the restart saw England fight back to lead briefly.\n\nBelgium now sit second in the group ahead of England by one point but two points behind group leaders, Netherlands.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nHaving battled to a narrow home win last Friday (27 October), England began on the front foot in Leuven with a fourth minute free-kick cleared by Belgium\u2019s Nicky Evrard.\n\nBelgium however drew first blood in this Halloween encounter after Chloe Kelly was penalised for handball just outside of the box, which allowd De Neve to curl her ninth-minute free-kick straight into the near-top right corner beyond the reach of an outstretched Mary Earps.\n\nEngland struggled to mount a response as Belgium continued to soak up their pressure and hit them on the counter attack, until Greenwood and Blom banged heads in the 18th minute as they tried to meet an aerial pass.\n\nThe impact of their clash of heads resulted in both players falling to ground which necessitated a 13-minute delay for medical treatment, with Blom eventually able to continue after concussion checks whilst Greenwood was stretchered off.\n\nEngland tweeted at half-time that Greenwood was concious and talking to medical staff under observation.\n\nAlex Greenwood is conscious and talking, and is being monitored by our medical staff. \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Lionesses (@Lionesses) October 31, 2023\n\nThat lengthy delay reignited England\u2019s intensity which paid off as Lucy Bronze drew a 36th minute foul from Marie Detruyer, from which she headed in from Kelly\u2019s subsequent free-kick two minutes later to restore parity.\n\nKelly then fired wide in 41st minute as Belgium were forced to substiute De Neves due to injury, which unsettled their defence.\n\nThat change further motivated England whilst Belgium\u2019s defence were adjusting to the enforced change, as Bronze\u2019s header a minute later from Keira Walsh\u2019s cross was fired wide on the rebound by Alessia Russo.\n\nEngland continued to press and got their reward in the 44th minute as Lauren Hemp was unleashed up the left flank by Walsh, which allowed her to find Kirby on the pullback to rifle in beyond Evrard to turn the tie around.\n\nEngland\u2019s lead however only lasted seven minutes into 14 minutes of first-half injury time, as Wullaert was played through on the counter-attack by Janice Cayman to slot into the far left corner to pull Belgium level at the break.\n\nUpon the second-half start, Kirby quickly drew a foul from Kassandra Missipo but Russo fumbled control from Kelly\u2019s free-kick and her shot was blocked as England attempted to reclaim the lead.\n\nEvrard then saved Kirby\u2019s shot from Bronze\u2019s pullback pass in the 52nd minute as England continued to test the Red Flames\u2019 defence.\n\nEngland however were given an almighty scare just past the hour mark as Wullaert pounced upon a through ball and side-stepped both Jess Carter and Millie Bright, yet Earps crucially blocked her shot with a stunning save to keep the score level.\n\nBelgium however were forced to defend for much of the last half-hour as Russo and Georgia Stanway saw shots denied, whilst substitute \u2013 Rachel Daly nodded wide in the 80th minute from Walsh\u2019s deep corner towards the left post.\n\nSarina Wiegman\u2019s Lionesses were eventually made to pay for their wasted chances as Stanway handballed Daniels\u2019 83rd minute spot, which led referee \u2013 Esther Staubli to award a penalty to the hosts.\n\nWullaert stepped up and fired the penalty into the bottom-left corner to put Belgium in front, despite Earps diving the correct way to try and make the save.\n\nBelgium eventually clung on for victory which put them second in the group ahead of England and two points behind Netherlands, with their two rivals set to meet on 1 December in a blockbuster showdown.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nBelgium will meet Scotland on Friday 1 December at Den Dreef, Leuven in a 8:30pm

    "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s prediction that Liverpool would not \u201cfly\u201d through the Europa League group stage amounts to their only mis-step so far. Qualification for the knockout phase is already close at hand with the procession continuing against Toulouse.\n\nKlopp could ring the changes before Nottingham Forest\u2019s Premier League visit on Sunday, give a full debut to 19-year-old left-back Luke Chambers, first Liverpool outings to Calum Scanlon and James McConnell, and still enjoy a fluent, dominant display. It was polished by goals from Diogo Jota, Wataru Endo, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the highly impressive Ryan Gravenberch and Mohamed Salah. Salah\u2019s strike with the final kick of the game was his 43rd European goal for Liverpool and took him above Thierry Henry as the most prolific goalscorer for an English club in European competition.\n\n\u201cI think I said it before \u2013 it is really easy to fall in love with this team, there is so much excitement,\u201d said the Liverpool manager after a seventh win in seven home matches this season. \u201cWe have to make massive steps, we have to grow, but a lot of signs are really positive and how the team interacts with each other is really nice.\u201d\n\nRivalry was forgotten and friendship remembered as Liverpool paid a warm tribute before kick-off to Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman who died on Monday. The Hollies\u2019 He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother \u2013 the song Kenwright chose for a Hillsborough tribute at Goodison Park and became a fund-raising single for the justice campaign \u2013 was played to mass applause from the Liverpool fans inside Anfield. Kenwright\u2019s powerful speech at the Hillsborough memorial service in 2013 and lasting support for the bereaved families will not be forgotten across Stanley Park.\n\nLiverpool have won all three group games with something to spare, underlining why they are favourites for this season\u2019s competition, but the visit of French Cup winners Toulouse proved the most entertaining contest so far. Granted, Toulouse\u2019s terrible defending was a contributory factor but so too was the marauding midfield play of Gravenberch and Liverpool\u2019s quality in front of goal.\n\nThe hosts swept into an early lead when Jota collected a Joe Gomez interception, spun away from Cristian C\u00e1sseres and Niklas Schmidt, breezed past a nonexistent challenge from Logan Costa and beat goalkeeper Guillaume Restes with a confident finish.\n\nDiogo Jota slots the ball past Guillaume Restes to give Liverpool an early lead at Anfield. Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/Shutterstock\n\nThe travelling Toulouse contingent were in uproar as their side stunned Anfield with a fine equaliser. Aron D\u00f8nnum dissected the Liverpool defence with a first time ball to Thijs Dallinga, who kept his cool on the long run towards Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher\u2019s goal and drilled his shot beyond the stand-in keeper.\n\nMore pedestrian defending allowed Liverpool to regain the lead via the first goal of Endo\u2019s Anfield career. Harvey Elliott played a short corner to Curtis Jones, he found Trent Alexander-Arnold, and the Japan international guided the captain\u2019s cross beyond the Toulouse keeper with a precise header. The towering Moussa Diarra epitomised Toulouse\u2019s defending around the goal by standing back to admire Endo as he headed home.\n\nQuick Guide Europa Conference League: Villa and Faroe Islanders soar Show Ollie Watkins continued his red-hot form as Aston Villa cruised to a statement 4-1 win at AZ Alkmaar in the Europa Conference League. The striker netted his 10th goal of the season and fourth in Europe this season on Thursday. Leon Bailey and Youri Tielemans \u2013 his first for Villa \u2013 put them in control in AZ Stadium after less than 25 minutes. Vangelis Pavlidis wasted the hosts' best chances but Watkins and John McGinn added more goals after the break in the Netherlands before Ibrahim Sadiq grabbed a consolation. It was the second time in two games Villa had scored four after their 4-1 Premier League win over West Ham on Sunday. Ki Klaksvik became the first Faroe Islands club to win in the group stages of a European competition with a stunning 3-0 success againt Olimpija Ljubljana. Rene Joensen, Pall Klettskard and Jakup Andreasen were the heroes at at the 6,500 capacity Torsvollur national stadium. Aberdeen's hopes of navigating a route through the Conference League group stage suffered a major blow as they threw away a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 against PAOK Salonika on a rollercoaster night at Pittodrie. Having weathered heavy pressure in a goalless first half, Barry Robson's men found themselves two goals to the good by the hour mark thanks to Bojan Miovski and Dante Polvara. But a stunning comeback saw the Greek side take three points after goals from substitutes Kiril Despodov and captain Vieirinha, and a stoppage-time penalty, awarded after a VAR check, from Stefan Schwab.

The midfielder\u2019s shot was blocked by Mikkel Desler but rebounded off Jones into the path of N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who lashed a thumping finish into the roof of Restes\u2019 net.\n\nThe second half was memorable mainly for misses. Gabriel Suazo squandered a glorious chance to haul Toulouse back into the contest when Kelleher sliced a clearance into the path of Dallinga. The goalscorer squared for Suazo who had a free shot on a goal with only Alexander-Arnold standing in it. To his despair, he managed to find the defender\u2019s thigh.\n\nNot to be outdone, N\u00fa\u00f1ez failed to complete what should have been a stunning individual goal when he left Rasmus Nicolaisen floundering with a superb footwork and rounded the Toulouse goalkeeper. The Uruguay international struck a post instead of the open goal and was on his knees in disbelief when Gravenberch finished the job from the rebound. Salah came off the bench to end the rout and create yet more history when scoring off the underside of the bar."

    "body": "It\u2019s official! Elon Musk\u2019s X marks the spot of the first confirmed investigation opened by the European Union under its rebooted digital rulebook, the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nAnnouncing the opening of a \u201cformal proceeding\u201d today, the European Commission said the investigation will look at whether the social networking platform may have breached rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers.\n\nThe opening of a formal DSA investigation on X comes hard on the heels of a complaint against X\u2019s adtech by privacy rights group, noyb \u2014 although today\u2019s formal proceeding is unlikely to be directly linked as the Commission has been probing the platform for months via a flurry of requests for information. Its earlier actions were focused on concerns about the spread of illegal content and disinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBack in October the Commission sent Musk\u2019s company an \u201curgent\u201d formal request for information about how it was responding to information risks arising out of the conflict. The EU also said then it was looking at X\u2019s compliance across a number of areas, including policies and practices regarding notices on illegal content, complaint handling, risk assessment and measures to mitigate the risks identified \u2014 and it gave X until the end of October to respond.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of the preliminary investigation conducted so far, including on the basis of an analysis of the risk assessment report submitted by X in September, X\u2019s Transparency report published on 3 November, and X\u2019s replies to a formal request for information, which, among others, concerned the dissemination of illegal content in the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel, the Commission has decided to open formal infringement proceedings against X under the Digital Services Act,\u201d the EU said today.\n\nPer the Commission, the EU\u2019s investigation of X focuses on the following areas and issues:\n\nCompliance with DSA obligations related to countering the dissemination of illegal content in the EU \u2014 \u201c notably in relation to the risk assessment and mitigation measures adopted by X to counter the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, as well as the functioning of the notice and action mechanism for illegal content in the EU mandated by the DSA, including in light of X\u2019s content moderation resources\n\n\u2014 \u201c The effectiveness of measures taken by X to combat info manipulation \u2014 with a focus on the effectiveness of its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system of crowdsourcing fact-checking to aggregated views of users, who may vote to label disputed tweets with additional context. The EU said the probe will also look at the effectiveness of \u201crelated policies mitigating risks to civic discourse and electoral processes\u201d\n\n\u2014 with a focus on the effectiveness of its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system of crowdsourcing fact-checking to aggregated views of users, who may vote to label disputed tweets with additional context. The EU said the probe will also look at the Transparency requirements \u2014 with a focus on \u201csuspected shortcomings\u201d by X in giving researchers access to publicly accessible data as mandated by Article 40 of the DSA, and suspected shortcomings in its ads repository (aka the ads transparency library the regulation also mandates)\n\n\u2014 with a focus on \u201csuspected shortcomings\u201d by X in giving researchers access to publicly accessible data as mandated by Article 40 of the DSA, and suspected shortcomings in its ads repository (aka the ads transparency library the regulation also mandates) Suspected deceptive design elements in X\u2019s user interface \u2014 \u201cnotably in relation to checkmarks linked to certain subscription products, the so-called Blue checks\u201d\n\n\u201cIf proven, these failures would constitute infringements of Articles 34(1), 34(2) and 35(1), 16(5) and 16(6), 25(1), 39 and 40(12) of the DSA,\u201d the EU added \u2014 saying it will now carry out an in-depth investigation \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d.\n\nToday we open formal infringement proceedings against @X : \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected breach of obligations to counter #IllegalContent and #Disinformation \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected breach of #Transparency obligations \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected #DeceptiveDesign of user interface#DSA pic.twitter.com/NxKIif603k \u2014 Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) December 18, 2023\n\nThe Commission is responsible for enforcing the DSA on larger platforms such as X \u2014 which was designated a very large online platform (VLOP) under the DSA back in April. Confirmed breaches of the online governance regime can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nThe EU can also apply interim measures where it believes there\u2019s a risk of serious harm for users and may even seek to have access to infringing services temporarily blocked. Although its announcement today is careful to caveat the development by affirming no conclusions have yet been reached.\n\nThere is also no confirmed timeline for the probe to conclude. But the fact of it being opened means other tools are put within reach of regulators and could be applied if the EU sees the need to act quickly \u2014 such as the aforementioned interim measures. So the Commission\u2019s official scrutiny of X could have real world implications for how the platform operates sooner rather than later.\n\nReached for a response to the EU probe, X\u2019s Joe Benarroch \u2014 who was brought into the company by CEO Linda Yaccarino relatively recently to work on business operations \u2014 said:\n\nX remains committed to complying with the Digital Services Act, and is cooperating with the regulatory process. It is important that this process remains free of political influence and follows the law. X is focused on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users on our platform, while protecting freedom of expression, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal.\n\nWhile X under Musk has very evidently been flying the ship in the opposite direction to the responsible governance the DSA intends to encourage \u2014 hence attracting so many warnings from EU lawmakers, even long before today\u2019s formal probe \u2014 it\u2019s notable X recently started offering a research program for outsiders to get data to systemic risks arising on the platform in the EU. However the Commission obviously has doubts X has gone far enough on the transparency front to meet the DSA\u2019s bar.\n\nEU regulators are also set to assess Musk & co\u2019s claims that replacing a formal content moderation function with crowdsourced opinions is a valid approach to tackling diverse information risks; and, consequently, to look into how much Musk\u2019s gutting of content moderation teams and processes has cost X\u2019s users in terms of harm exposure.\n\nTo say the Commission\u2019s investigation looks fascinating and timely is an understatement.\n\nEU lawmakers can certainly bask in the glow of being prepared for the possibility of an erratic billionaire running a wrecking ball through a major social platform. But of course they will need to follow through \u2014 and it\u2019s clear the real work is just starting. So this probe looks set to be a test of how much stomach the EU has to actually enforce the rules it loves to lay down on paper.\n\nThe investigation may also test Musk\u2019s mettle for what could be an expensive head-on clash with EU regulators. Time will tell how this one plays out but he may find the dead blue bird he\u2019s chosen to hang around his neck, when he purposefully ripped up the standard content moderation rulebook and opted to channel online chaos, starting to feel like it\u2019s dragging him down."

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The corporate and creative philosophy behind streaming television is in a state of flux, and now the cracks in the prevailing wisdom are starting to appear. Take, for instance, the value of exclusivity. For the past five or so years entertainment companies have been focused on creating their own streaming platforms, which would be built around exclusive control of their original content, whether it was original new series or a sister studio\u2019s Hollywood movies. But now that income is desired most, some streamers are once again willing to sell non-exclusive rights to others. In December, one of the best original shows on Paramount+, the compelling horror-laced drama Yellowjackets, will become available on Netflix (see below for my recommendation). Netflix gets a buzzy show the vast majority of its subscribers have never had access to, while Paramount+ earns a rights payment and broadens the audience for Yellowjackets, which has a third season commissioned. Streaming\u2019s walls are crumbling. That said, there are still plenty of promising new shows and movies, most of them exclusive to their services, debuting in December. Whether you\u2019re after an awards season blockbuster (Netflix\u2019s Maestro) or an Australian comic-drama (Binge\u2019s Strife), your watchlist should be well loaded. Netflix Bradley Cooper stars as legedary conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein in Maestro. Credit: Jason McDonald/Netflix My top Netflix recommendation is Maestro (December 20). Not since Warren Beatty in the late 1970s has a Hollywood leading man so completely \u2013 perhaps obsessively \u2013 given themselves over to filmmaking as Bradley Cooper. The credit he banked from starring in the Hangover comedies, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Sniper let Cooper co-write, direct and star in the 2018 hit A Star is Born. He now fills the same three positions in another movie about a tormented musician: the superstar American conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein. Cooper bristles at the term biopic, and instead the film focuses on Bernstein\u2019s conducting, his nurturing marriage to Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), and his parallel relationships with male lovers. There\u2019s no Shallow to be found here, but Cooper appears to inhabit Bernstein across decades and the film is primed for the Academy Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on Netflix: Few shows recently have cast a spell as intense as Yellowjackets (December 15), a now-and-then horror thriller about a group of deeply divided 40-something women forced to confront the grim but unspoken reality of how they endured 18 months marooned in the Canadian wilderness as teenagers. With Juliette Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci among the survivors, the story is a mix of supernatural menace, black comedy, teenage adversity, and deeply expressed trauma. It\u2019s coming to Netflix after two years on Paramount+ and it\u2019s a can\u2019t-look-away binge just waiting to happen. When the history of the high-concept Hollywood blockbuster is written, Zack Snyder\u2019s name will be prominent \u2013 for better or worse. Snyder is responsible for 300, Man of Steel, and most of Justice League, and having come to Netflix for the tepid zombie heist movie Army of the Dead he\u2019s doubling down with Rebel Moon: Part One \u2013 A Child of Fire (December 22). A two-part space opera \u2013 the sequel is scheduled for next April \u2013 that Snyder originally pitched as a Star Wars spin-off, it\u2019s a Seven Samurai-influenced epic about a former soldier, Kora (Atomic Blonde\u2019s Sofia Boutella), who recruits a group of mercenaries (Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou) to defend the farmers on a moon threatened by the galaxy\u2019s authoritarian ruler. Digital science-fiction spectacle is a given, but can Snyder deliver genuine emotional stakes? November highlights: David Fincher hit the mark with his assured hitman drama The Killer, documentary Last Stop Larrimah was a fascinating outback mystery, Robbie Williams was a star telling his own story, but prestige drama All the Light We Cannot See fell short. Binge Opal (BeBe Bettencourt), Christine (Maria Angelico), Jeeet (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Bryony Skillington) and Evelyn (Asher Keddie) in Strife. Credit: Binge My top Binge recommendation is Strife (December 6). It\u2019s not a direct adaptation, but this new Australian comic-drama about a woman trying to keep up with her own life is based on Mia Freedman\u2019s 2017 memoir, Work Strife Balance. Asher Keddie, who has previously summed up the conflicting demands on professional women in Offspring and Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, plays the fictional Evelyn Jones, a blogger who strikes a chord and becomes an online publisher and media commentator just as her marriage is coming apart. Evelyn keeps getting pulled in every direction, a situation that should be both comically rich and smartly telling in the hands of the show\u2019s creator, Sarah Scheller, who previously put together the terrific motherhood comedy The Letdown (currently on Netflix). The supporting cast includes Matt Day (Rake) and Jonathan LaPaglia (The Slap).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on Binge: I won\u2019t spoil it, but there was a nerve-shredding cliffhanger in the first season of Vigil (December 11) that I still think about far too often. That\u2019s a pretty strong indicator that this Scottish crime thriller, where a police detective was assigned to a murder investigation on board an on-duty British nuclear submarine, pushed the right buttons. The show\u2019s second season stays on dry land but retains the military focus: when an attack drone demonstration at a British army base goes tragically wrong, Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva (Suranne Jones, Gentleman Jack) and her now pregnant partner, Detective Sergeant Kirsten Longacre (Rose Leslie, Game of Thrones), are called in to investigate. Expect a fast pace and significant twists \u2013 this series doesn\u2019t do quiet contemplation. November highlights: Comedy troupe Please Don\u2019t Destroy flew the flag for 20-somethings with The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, picaresque comedy Bookie made the right bet, and Julia continued the celebrity chef biography of Julia Child. Stan* Claudia Karvan and Nathalie Morris in the new season of Bump. Credit: Stan My top Stan recommendation is Bump (December 26). It\u2019s one of the best new traditions in Australian television: a new season of this tremendous Sydney-based comic-drama gets uploaded every Boxing Day. This is the fourth instalment of Kelsey Munro and Claudia Karvan\u2019s show and one of the strong points about it is that each iteration places its ensemble cast in a testing new light. The high-school students of season one, Oly (Nathalie Morris) and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr), who were thrown together when a hook-up turned into a teenage pregnancy, are now a career woman and stay-at-home dad while their daughter, Jacinda (Ava Cannon), is in primary school. Bump tugs at the heartstrings, but with hard-earned understanding and a feel for the contrary demands of family. Please keep it coming. Also on Stan: Revealed: Ben Roberts-Smith Truth on Trial (December 10) is a feature-length documentary that provides the inside story to one of Australia\u2019s most contentious and headline-making pieces of investigative journalism: the five-year quest to unearth the truth behind rumours that the country\u2019s most decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, committed war crimes in Afghanistan. With stories in The Age and Sydney Morning Herald, as well as on 60 Minutes, journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters pushed to bring the truth to the public, navigating divisions in the SAS and eventually the defamation trial that Roberts-Smith brought to court and lost. It\u2019s been a compelling saga, and Dora Weekley\u2019s documentary should include hitherto unknown details and unheard commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI still haven\u2019t got over the nightmarish sounds of a spinal surgery going very wrong in the first season, but nonetheless Dr Death (December 22) is back for a second serve of malpractice and monstrous medical egos. This American true crime drama is now an anthology. Every season is a different doctor whose abuse of privilege posed a criminal risk to their patients. The new season will cover Paolo Macchiarini, an Italian surgeon and researcher who was accused of laboratory fraud and manipulative behaviour. Fresh from Wolf Like Me, Edgar Ramirez plays Macchiarini, while Mandy Moore (This is Us) is Benita Alexander, the journalist who got dangerously close to the truth. November highlights: The final season of groundbreaking Canadian comedy Sort Of confirmed it as an under-the-radar gem, Scrublands was a tight Australian crime thriller, and science-fiction fans got a spin-off with Orphan Black: Echoes. Amazon Prime Alan Ritchson returns in Reacher. Credit: Amazon Prime My top Amazon Prime recommendation is Reacher (December 15). I am much heartened by the star of this American action series, Alan Ritchson, who decided that, despite looking like an absolute unit in the show\u2019s first season, he nonetheless needed to add even more muscle for these new episodes to convincingly depict Jack Reacher. Adapted from Lee Child\u2019s wildly successful novels about an off-the-grid former US military policeman \u2013 somehow the diminutive Tom Cruise played the role in a pair of movies \u2013 Reacher is an uncomplicated guy: he fixes wrongs with two fists and zero concerns. If anything, the first season was too subtle, so an even larger Reacher who drops deadpan one-liners while having access to a missile launcher seems promising. And I\u2019m taking the under for the proposition of whether a ripped Reacher sheds his shirt within three episodes. Also on Amazon Prime: Recommending Prisoner\u2019s Daughter (December 5) is a bet on talent. This domestic drama has a familiar outline, with an ageing and terminally ill criminal having his sentence commuted on the grounds that he lives with his estranged daughter, a single mother and Las Vegas waitress struggling to make ends meet and connect her son with a positive role model. Obviously, they\u2019re going to belatedly bond in the face of increasingly fraught difficulties, but how that plays out will be guided by the performances of Brian Cox (Succession) and Kate Beckinsale (Laurel Canyon) as father and daughter, and the direction of Catherine Hardwicke, who found something genuine in the first Twilight movie before being replaced for the sequels by a succession of ill-equipped male filmmakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember highlights: The adult animated superhero drama Invincible returned with more cape fear, while the Bond franchise authorised a reality competition with 007: Road to a Million. Apple TV+ The Peanuts gang is back in The Snoopy Show - Happiness is Holiday Traditions. Credit: Apple TV+ My top Apple TV+ recommendation is The Snoopy Show: Happiness is Holiday Traditions (December 1). Just quietly, over the past two years Apple TV+ has been producing a nourishing stream of animated Snoopy content that is faithful to Charles M Schulz\u2019s beloved comic strip, Peanuts. The spotted white beagle and his adolescent cohort \u2013 Charlie Brown, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, and many more \u2013 have always transferred easily from a panel on the page to an animation frame, and this official adaptation has a trademark mix of wry humour, flights of fantasy, and heartwarming camaraderie. Happiness is Holiday Traditions is a bonus special to close off the third season of the series, and it will stay true to the rule that helps make Peanuts endure: no adults are seen or heard. Also on Apple TV+: The trailer for Family Plan (December 15), an action-comedy feature where Mark Wahlberg plays a former master assassin who left the trade and secretly built a new life in the American suburbs as a cheerful husband and father, is goofy as all heck. The question is whether it\u2019s ludicrous fun or just sappy shenanigans? Wahlberg\u2019s Dan Morgan, who has to go on a Las Vegas road trip with his blissfully unaware family after his cover is blown, dispatching goons while carrying his youngest in a BabyBjorn and stunt driving in a family minivan are positive signs. Michelle Monaghan (True Detective) plays Mrs Morgan, who quietly thinks her husband is a little vanilla, and the fine Irish actor Ciaran Hinds (There Will Be Blood) goes full villain. November highlights: The Buccaneers placed a modern teen lens on Edith Wharton\u2019s period marital drama, while Godzilla and pals returned for Monarchy: Legacy of Monsters and space race alternate history For All Mankind reached the 21st century.\n\nAdvertisement"

    "body": "This sport\u2019s identity crisis has existed since the inception of the College Football Playoff a decade ago, but never before have we had to come to terms with it the way we did on Sunday.\n\nThat identity crisis? Whether the teams that play for the national championship should be the best or the most deserving. In the nine years before this season, the best and most deserving seamlessly became one, resulting in cut-and-dried decisions on which teams would make the field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the final season of the four-team era \u2014 before it expands to 12 in 2024 \u2014 the CFP committee was charged with a very difficult decision that was guaranteed to result in a worthy team feeling cheated. The committee, for the first time, was actually going to have to choose what it values more \u2014 the teams that earned it or the teams that look the best on TV.\n\nFlorida State, the most deserving, became the first unbeaten Power 5 conference champion left out of the field. The Seminoles were the ones left feeling cheated.\n\nAnd with that one decision, the committee didn\u2019t just choose teams in a given year. It revealed to the world the ugly truth about college football \u2014 this sport is a beauty contest where decisions on which teams can win the national title are sometimes made as much in a cozy hotel boardroom in Grapevine, Texas, as they are on the actual field.\n\nThe Playoff field is as follows: 1. Michigan, 2. Washington, 3. Texas, 4. Alabama.\n\nMichigan and Washington made it through the season unscathed. Texas lost a nail-biter in its rivalry game to Oklahoma, and the Longhorns, wait for it, beat Alabama.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if Florida State\u2019s star quarterback, Jordan Travis, didn\u2019t break his leg two weeks ago. But the Seminoles team that just beat Louisville 16-6 in the ACC Championship Game was relying on a third-string quarterback. The win was far from impressive.\n\ndevastated. heartbroken. In so much disbelief rn, I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y\u2019all could see this team is much more than the quarterback. I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry. Go Noles! \u2014 Jordan Travis (@jordantrav13) December 3, 2023\n\nThe committee, knowing it was going to unjustly break someone\u2019s heart, decided to break Florida State\u2019s. In that room on Saturday night, the committee members decided the Seminoles weren\u2019t good enough for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not what sports are supposed to be about. And with the four-team CFP era ending after this season, fans will be viewing it as a broken system that needed to be changed rather than the first frontier of the modernization of the sport.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to fathom why the committee couldn\u2019t choose between Alabama and Texas. Alabama is a one-loss SEC champion that beat Georgia on Saturday, ending the Bulldogs\u2019 29-game winning streak. Texas, a one-loss Big 12 champion, beat Alabama by 10 points in Tuscaloosa in September.\n\nMany fans were hoping that the SEC would be left out entirely for the first time, but the committee \u2014 charged with picking the \u201cbest teams\u201d \u2014 couldn\u2019t ignore what the ultra-talented Crimson Tide accomplished. But if Alabama goes, how could the committee leave the team out that beat it?\n\nIt couldn\u2019t.\n\nThis is probably the path of least resistance. Outside of Florida State fans, the general population will move on convinced that the Playoff semifinals will be more entertaining with more high-level teams. The best teams, as they say, won out.\n\nThe problem with choosing the best is that it\u2019s entirely subjective and ultimately misleading given this is a sport that routinely features unpredictable results and unforeseen runs. The last time a team was relying on a third-string quarterback heading into the College Football Playoff \u2014 Ohio State in the inaugural season of the four-team field \u2014 won the national title.\n\nThe difference between those Buckeyes and this Florida State team was that Ohio State won the Big Ten title game that year 59-0. Florida State was in a close game with Louisville that was, quite frankly, not an enjoyable watch for people who love the excitement of big-time offense. Perception, wrongly, became reality.\n\n\u201cFlorida State is a different team,\u201d CFP committee chair Boo Corrigan said after the field was revealed. \u201cYou look at who they are as a team without Jordan Travis \u2014 they are a different team.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s a well-informed opinion that\u2019s probably true. It, however, is not a fact. You could make the case that Florida State is so good that it won a Power 5 conference championship game with a true freshman quarterback. In the CFP, Florida State would have gotten second-string quarterback Tate Rodemaker back with a month to prepare for a semifinal game.\n\nFlorida State was robbed.\n\nAnd its head coach didn\u2019t hide his disappointment.\n\n\u201cI am disgusted and infuriated with the committee\u2019s decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games,\u201d Mike Norvell said in a statement. \u201cWhat is the point of playing games?\u201d\n\nAs difficult as it would have been, the right thing for the committee to do would have been to leave Alabama out. Most of us know in our gut that the Crimson Tide \u2014 the most talented team, on paper, in the sport \u2014 are one of the four best teams. Alabama is certainly equipped to win the whole thing.\n\nBut Alabama \u2014 like peers Georgia and Ohio State, teams with a wealth of raw talent on their rosters \u2014 lost a game (at home). Better teams have been left out in the past than this Alabama team because losses had consequences.\n\nAlabama\u2019s loss to Texas didn\u2019t have a consequence because we\u2019re enamored with the SEC and what it means to beat Georgia. It didn\u2019t matter that Alabama \u2014 though perceived to be an entirely different team in September \u2014 lost to the Longhorns. That game could have been a Playoff game in September. It turns out it was an exhibition.\n\nThere are plenty of people who are against the expansion of the field to 12 because of the sanctity of the regular season. But if the games in the regular season aren\u2019t going to matter when it comes to picking the final four, then there are no consequences for expanding to 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regular season didn\u2019t decide who made it this year. Thirteen people did.\n\nThe games mattered. The results didn\u2019t.\n\n(Photo of Mike Norvell: Isaiah Vazquez / Getty Images)"

    "body": "Two members of the billionaire family that controls Rogers Communications Inc. are suing the company, saying they\u2019ve been frozen out of board meetings and blocked from getting information, reigniting a bitter power struggle within one of Canada\u2019s wealthiest clans.\n\nMelinda Rogers-Hixon says she\u2019s the target of a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d by her older brother, Rogers Chair Edward Rogers, according to a letter contained in the court filing. The Rogers siblings were close to an agreement that would have resolved their longstanding differences, but Edward Rogers reneged on it, according to the Sept. 20 missive by Rogers-Hixon, which was sent to Chief Executive Officer Tony Staffieri.\n\nThe court petition was filed by Rogers-Hixon and her sister, Martha Rogers, and it argues the company has been \u201coppressive\u201d to them.\n\nThe documents show that the fractures inside the prominent Toronto family have never healed. Rogers Communications is the country\u2019s largest wireless provider and the owner of a cable television empire, the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team and other media and sports assets. The family\u2019s controlling stake in the public company is worth close to C$8 billion ($5.9 billion), according to calculations based on company filings for its 2023 annual meeting.\n\nShares of Rogers extended losses on news of the lawsuit, closing down 2.2% to C$53.07 in Toronto. They\u2019ve dropped 16% this year.\n\nThe children of late founder Ted Rogers have frequently fought one another \u2014 sometimes driving down Rogers\u2019 stock price as investors grew worried about the company\u2019s governance.\n\nThe bad blood spilled into full view in October 2021, when Edward Rogers publicly battled his sisters and his mother for control of the board and won in court. The result was that five Rogers Communications directors were fired, replaced by five allies of Edward Rogers. Soon after, then-CEO Joe Natale was sacked and replaced by Staffieri, the former chief financial officer. Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers had opposed the CEO change.\n\nIn early 2022, family members agreed to temporarily shelve their disagreements, according to this week\u2019s court filing, to avoid negative publicity as the company sought regulators\u2019 approval for the takeover of Shaw Communications Inc. The C$20 billion transaction was the company\u2019s biggest deal ever and among the largest corporate transactions in Canadian history.\n\nNegotiations Collapse\n\nAs part of that truce, Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers agreed not to participate in board discussions about the Shaw deal or receive materials on it, because of an argument about Rogers-Hixon\u2019s personal lawyer, whose firm also does work for Telus Corp., a competitor to Rogers and Shaw.\n\nThe Shaw takeover finally closed on April 3 of this year, and the Rogers siblings engaged in talks \u201cintended to resolve all issues between us,\u201d Rogers-Hixon stated in an affidavit. \u201cI was hopeful all issues could be resolved without negative publicity.\u201d But those negotiations collapsed last month, she said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear from the court filings whether the discussions included the possibility that any Rogers family members would sell their stake in Rogers Communications, leave their roles at the company, or exit the family trust that controls almost all of the voting shares of the public company.\n\n\u201cThis matter should be resolved privately,\u201d Rogers Communications spokesperson Sarah Schmidt said by email. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that we will not be distracted by these actions \u2014 we have significant momentum in the market, our merger is tracking ahead of plan, and we remain squarely focused on doing what\u2019s right for our customers and stakeholders.\u201d\n\nStill Excluded\n\nBoth Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers said in documents that they\u2019re still being excluded from some parts of board and committee meetings and are being given redacted board documents.\n\n\u201cI cannot properly perform my duties as a director if information that is provided to the rest of the directors is being withheld from me,\u201d Rogers-Hixon said in her affidavit. The two sisters are seeking a judge\u2019s order to force the company to share information with them and allow them to attend, in full, all meetings of the board, as well as board committees they belong to.\n\nRogers took \u201creasonable steps\u201d to protect company information from a competitor, Schmidt said. Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers could have resolved the matter by choosing a different lawyer, \u201cand they chose not to do so,\u201d she added.\n\nThe court filing also suggests that Rogers-Hixon was forced out of her role as a director of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the company that owns Toronto\u2019s professional hockey and basketball teams and in which Rogers Communications is a large minority investor.\n\nRogers\u2019 corporate governance committee is conducting an investigation of the events that took place in 2021, documents show. The committee has asked for copies of \u201call correspondence\u201d between Rogers-Hixon and former CEO Natale, three other former executives, the five ousted directors, Martha Rogers, journalists and others, according to a letter to Rogers-Hixon that\u2019s included with the court filing.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is intended to inform decisions that may be made about your status as a director of RCI,\u201d says the letter signed by Robert Gemmell, a former Citigroup Inc. banker who is Rogers\u2019 lead director.\n\nAlthough the company is controlled by a family trust, it\u2019s structured in a way that gives significant power to the trust\u2019s chair, in this case Edward Rogers, the only son of late founder Ted Rogers. That\u2019s what allowed him to reshape the board in 2021 over the opposition of family members.\n\nThe family dynamics have grown even more complicated in recent months because of the deaths of three key insiders. Loretta Rogers \u2014 the mother of Martha, Melinda, Edward and Lisa Rogers \u2014 died in June 2022. Alan Horn and Phil Lind, two longtime executives who were on the Rogers board and aligned with Edward Rogers, died this year.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Kevin Orland"

    "body": "Canada took a major step towards Copa America 2024 qualification as Stephen Eustaquio's 85th-minute strike gave them victory in their CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal first leg and a first win in Jamaica for 35 years.\n\nPorto midfielder Eustaquio slotted in from Richie Laryea's surging run and low delivery, restoring the lead Canada had initially established through Jonathan David during first-half added time.\n\nShamar Nicholson fired in Jamaica's equaliser 13 minutes after the break but their opponents will seal their place at Copa America if they avoid defeat in the second leg at Ontario's BMO Field on Tuesday.\n\nJamaica vs Canada result\n\nScore Goal scorers Jamaica 1 Shamar Nicholson (58) Canada 2 Jonathan David (45 +2), Stephen Eustaquio (85)\n\nStarting lineups:\n\nJamaica (4-4-2, right to left): Blake (GK) \u2014 Leigh, Pinnock, Bernard, Lembikisa \u2014 Decordova-Reid, Latibeaudiere, Johnson, Bailey \u2014 Antonio, Nicholson\n\nCanada (4-4-2, right to left): Borjan (GK) \u2014 Laryea, Vitoria, Miller, Adekugbe \u2014 Buchanan, Kone, Eustaquio, Davies \u2014 Larin, David\n\nIn a game rearranged for Saturday after heavy rain flooded parts of Kingston's Independence Park on Friday, David capitalised on a skilful turn and cross from Cyle Larin to score his 26th international goal as part of a dominant first half in which his side had four of the five attempts on target.\n\nThe Reggae Boyz went closest before David broke the deadlock, Aston Villa attacker Leon Bailey hitting the post with a shot from Bobby Decordova-Reid's corner.\n\nNicholson was aghast when his finish was initially ruled out for offside, only for a VAR intervention and pitchside monitor check by referee Mary Penso to justify Jamaica's celebrations in their technical area.\n\nThe Spartak Moscow forward had raced on to Daniel Johnson's quickly taken freekick and converted coolly to give Jamaica hope of extending their unbeaten run to six matches.\n\nAs well as a Copa America berth, the winners in three days' time will advance to the semifinals of the Nations League, where their opponents will be one of fellow quarterfinalists the USA, Trinidad and Tobago, Honduras, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama.\n\nFULL TIME: @CanadaSoccerEN \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 defeats Jamaica in the first leg of the #CNL Quarter-Finals! \ud83d\udd1a pic.twitter.com/jSis5C72tj \u2014 Concacaf Nations League (@CNationsLeague) November 18, 2023\n\nHow can Canada qualify for the Copa America 2024?\n\nThe Rouges' task is now ostensibly straightforward: avoid defeat against Jamaica and they will be competing alongside the likes of reigning champions Argentina at the Copa America in the US when it starts in June.\n\nJamaica have never won in Canada, although they showed enough here \u2014 in sunshine, mercifully, following the postponement of the game in torrential conditions the previous night \u2014 to suggest they could spring an upset.\n\nTheir task will be made harder by the probable absence of Michail Antonio, while Bailey could not match speed and timing with accurate finishes when presented with good early chances.\n\nWest Ham United forward Antonio immediately signalled for treatment before limping down the tunnel with a possible hamstring injury during the first half.\n\nReaction from Steven Vitoria:\n\n\n\n\"It feels great to get our first win here in 35 years. It wasn't easy, far from it. Still a lot to be done but we're one step closer to where we want to go.\"#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/3YYwSNCgFm \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\nLille striker David had two promising early opportunities, poking a shot into Milan Borjan's arms under pressure from two markers and applying a looping header to an Alphonso Davies cross, forcing the goalkeeper to backpedal and claim.\n\nEven if they are knocked out on Wednesday, there will be another chance for the losers of the tie to reach the Copa America.\n\nThe ousted Nations League quarterfinalists will compete for two more qualification spots, and the calibre of teams in those playoffs is likely to be weaker, with the USA looking almost certain not to need that route following their 3-0 first-leg win over Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nEustaquio's first international goal since 2021 also ended Canada's run of two consecutive defeats and gave them a second win in seven matches.\n\nReaction from Milan Borjan:\n\n\n\n\"It feels amazing. What the boys did today, in this heat and on this pitch, is unbelievable. We need to come out again and show the brotherhood in Toronto. We need a full stadium there to give us that support.\" #CANMNT pic.twitter.com/lwuD0qLvp2 \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\nThe Sporting News followed the rescheduled Jamaica vs Canada match live, providing updates below\n\nJamaica vs Canada updates from rescheduled CONCACAF Nations League match\n\nFulltime: Jamaica 1-2 Canada\n\nCanada will reach Copa America 2024 if they preserve their unbeaten record at home to Jamaica on Wednesday!\n\nThe hosts are a little unfortunate, having scored an equaliser and held out until five minutes from time, but they now face a huge task to reach the semifinals.\n\n90 mins: Jamaica 1-2 Canada\n\nGood news for Jamaica: there will be six minutes of added time.\n\n87 mins: Jamaica 1-2 Canada\n\nIt's been 35 years since Canada have won in Jamaica. Now would be a great time to end that run and put them within touching distance of Copa America.\n\n85 mins: GOAL \u2013 Jamaica 1-2 Canada (Stephen Eustaquio)\n\nIs that a huge goal for Canada?\n\nRichie Laryea charges clear on the right, approaches the penalty area and cuts a perceptive low pass back into the path of the onrushing, unmarked Stephen Eustaquio, who slots in!\n\nWatch:\n\nStephen Eustaquio at 85' scores a game-changer for Canada! \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/fWVK4mOplG \u2014 Concacaf Nations League (@CNationsLeague) November 18, 2023\n\n82 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nThere's some choreographed dancing going on in the stands involving fans in green shirts carrying yellow pompoms. Cheering scenes.\n\nThe official attendance is a little more than 3,500.\n\n79 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nAlphonso Davies shows some invention for Canada on the left, but the ball ends up in Andre Blake's arms.\n\n76 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nLeon Bailey is booked for an altercation with his marker. It's been a while since we've had a clear chance in this game \u2013 settle for a draw all-round?\n\n73 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nIt's drinks break time. Canada emerged the stronger following the first-half drinks break...\n\n70 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nCanada have never lost at home to Jamaica, so you suspect they'll be satisfied with this result. Their opponents have shown enough to suggest they could spring a surprise in the return game, though.\n\n67 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nA Canada substitution we could have mentioned...\n\nSUBSTITUTION \ud83d\udd01\n\n\n\nMark-Anthony Kaye is coming on for Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9.#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/sljhsLwnT8 \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\n64 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nJamaica have a freekick beyond the halfway line. As usual, they send a string of players towards the penalty area. Milan Borjan catches the cross.\n\n61 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nStephen Eust\u00e1quio's freekick doesn't create a great deal of danger. Canada have only won one of their last 11 visits to Jamaica, and that record won't improve unless they can do better than that from opportunities.\n\n60 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nCanada have a freekick just outside the edge of the Jamaica penalty area on the left. This is promising. Andre Blake stands at his near post and directs some of his team-mates.\n\n57 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada\n\nReferee Mary Penso checked the pitchside monitor and agreed with Shamar Nicholson's protestations that the goal should have counted.\n\nThat goal came about because of a quick piece of thinking from Daniel Johnson, directing a freekick on to Shamar Nicholson's run while Canada appeared to have switched off.\n\nWatch:\n\nIt\u2019s 1-1!

There will be a VAR check...\n\n54 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada\n\nHere's how Jamaica started.\n\n51 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada\n\nCanada go close! Jonathan David nears the centre of the penalty area in a central position and lashes a dipping shot towards goal which Andre Blake does well to tip behind.\n\n48 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada\n\nThere's a scene that looks better suited to WWE as Richie Laryea and Shamar Nicholson both dive to the floor following a full-throttle tussle for the ball on the flank.\n\nReferee Mary Penso rushes in to calm the situation down. Jamaica's Nicholson needs to keep his cool, having been booked during the first half.\n\n46 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada\n\nJamaica restart the action!\n\nHalftime: Jamaica 0-1 Canada\n\nIt wasn't all plain sailing for Canada - especially when Leon Bailey struck a post with a shot - but they are good value for their lead after having 11 of the 16 attempts at goal during that half and four of the five on target.\n\nThis would be an excellent result for their prospects of qualifying for Copa America 2024, with the home leg to come for them.\n\n45 mins +2: GOAL \u2013 Jamaica 0-1 Canada (Jonathan David)\n\nCanada take the lead! Cyle Larin responds to a bouncing ball inside the box by turning smartly to befuddle his two markers, then scythes a low delivery across the face of goal.\n\nJonathan David gratefully gobbles up the opportunity, tapping in at the far post!\n\nWatch:\n\nJonathan David lights up the scoreboard for Canada! \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 pic.twitter.com/bCVlAEQpge \u2014 Concacaf Nations League (@CNationsLeague) November 18, 2023\n\n45 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nEnd-to-end fare. Ethan Pinnock stops Jonathan David from getting a shot away inside the penalty area, and Andre Blake then punches Alphonso Davies' cross clear from a crowded box.\n\nAt the other end, Sam Adekugbe shows strength and speed to stop Trivante Stewart from racing clear onto a long ball.\n\n44 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nBobby De Cordova-Reid almost set up an opener for Leon Bailey five minutes ago. This time he takes aim himself from a long way out, zipping a shot into Milan Borjan's arms.\n\n41 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nMilan Borjan is down for an extended period of treatment. The Canada goalkeeper was clutching his left calf.\n\nShamar Nicholson, who appeared to be the possible culprit, exchanges a hug with Borjan after he rises to his feet but is still booked for his trouble.\n\n39 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nLeon Bailey hits the crossbar! Bobby De Cordova-Reid sends a corner towards the far post, where Bailey beats his man with his run and sends his low first-time strike against the near post and away.\n\nJamaica could not have come any closer!\n\n36 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nCanada have had the better of the action since the drinks break. Alphonso Davies fails to beat the first defender with a corner from the right, but Canada find him in a good position on the same flank again, from where he whips a cross towards Jonathan David at the far post.\n\nThe forward loops a header back in the opposite direction, and the backtracking Andre Blake stretches to claim with reasonable ease.\n\n33 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nAlphonso Davies has a chance to send in a freekick from a useful position not far from the Jamaica penalty area in the right channel.\n\nHis low delivery bobbles through almost everyone before the hosts clear.\n\n30 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nThe action resumes with a goalkick to Canada. The game has been played at a ponderous pace at times \u2013 you sense these teams need to up the ante if a breakthrough is to come before the interval, although perhaps both are happy to remain cagey during the early stages of the tie.\n\n27 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nDrinks break time. Jamaica coach Heimir Hallgrimsson is wearing a fetching back-to-front white baseball cap as he offers instructions to Trivante Stewart, among others.\n\nA man in a marvellous yellow wig and black-and-yellow tracksuit can be seen in the stands, which are somewhat sparsely populated.\n\n24 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nSubstitute Trivante Stewart turns and tries his luck from distance for Jamaica, to no avail.\n\nThese sides are yet to find their range yet.\n\n21 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nIsmael Kone sends a fierce shot from outside the penalty area wide for Canada.\n\nTrivante Stewart has replaced Jamaica's Michail Antonio, who limped off a few minutes ago.\n\n18 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nBad news for West Ham United fans: Michail Antonio is down for an extended period of time and asks to be substituted.\n\nHe eventually rises to his feet and hobbles down the tunnel, accompanied by medical staff. Speculatively, that could be a hamstring issue.\n\n15 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nLeon Bailey should have scored for Jamaica again! An aerial ball down the flank bounces kindly for the Aston Villa attacker inside the penalty area on the left, deceiving Steven Vitoria.\n\nBailey drags his first-time shot wide of the far post. Heimir Hallgrimsson applauds as Bailey's runs continue to cause Canada problems.\n\n13 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nLeon Bailey can only nod the freekick on. Milan Borjan scoops the ball up in Canada's goal.\n\n12 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nJamaica win a freekick beyond the halfway line on the right and load the box. Well, it's not quite the penalty area, but there's a long line of players awaiting the delivery just outside of it.\n\n9 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nBest chance so far for Canada! Jonathan David breaks free inside the Jamaica penalty area on the right, sending Greg Leigh off balance and coming under pressure from Daniel Johnson as he closes in on goal.\n\nThe striker can only poke a low shot gently towards goalkeeper Andre Blake, who gathers.\n\n7 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nThere isn't a great deal of action to report in the sunshine. Here's how Canada looked before kickoff.\n\n4 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nJamaica should have scored! Leon Bailey is through on goal from a long ball but produces a tame, rushed finish that drops comfortably wide of Milan Borjan's goal with the goalkeeper well off his line.\n\nManager Heimir Hallgrimsson turns and shows his frustration on the sideline, while Bailey - justifiably - looks sheepish. That was well short of the quality he's capable of.\n\n2 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nLeon Bailey canters along the left flank and sends in a dangerous low cross which Canada do well to clear. Bailey is adjudged to have been offside.\n\n1 min: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\n\nGlorious-looking conditions in Kingston this morning, thankfully, with sunshine and a picturesque, tree-filled backdrop to this stadium.\n\nIt's a quiet start between these sides, Jamaica in their familiar yellow and green home strip, Canada in dark blue.\n\n20 mins to kickoff: Here's how Canada prepared.\n\nTime to get loose \ud83c\udfc3 pic.twitter.com/fWUbJQQiyp \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\n40 mins to kickoff: Jamaica's lineup (4-4-2, right to left): Blake (GK) \u2013 Leigh, Pinnock, Bernard, Lembikisa \u2013 Decordova-Reid, Latibeaudiere, Johnson, Bailey \u2013 Antonio, Nicholson\n\n1 hour to kickoff: Team news! Here's how Canada start...\n\n1 hour 20 mins to kickoff: A reminder that the winners of this tie will qualify for the 2024 Copa America. They'll have another shot at doing so, though, if they lose, because the losing quarterfinalists play each other for two remaining slots at the tournament.\n\n1 hour 40 mins to kickoff: The conditions this morning in Jamaica are more promising, if the hosts' latest post on social media is any measure...\n\nGood Morning Jamaica. Just a reminder kick off is at 10:30am.\n\n\n\nCome out and cheer on our Boyz.\n\n\n\nAll patrons who bought tickets will be allowed to enter the Grandstand only.

Stick with us - heavy rain permitting - for live updates as the match finally takes place.\n\nUPDATE: Concacaf has rescheduled #CANMNT\u2019s @CNationsLeague match due to adverse weather conditions and it will be played at 10:30AM ET tomorrow morning. pic.twitter.com/JsTuer642p \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\nUPDATE (8:35 p.m. ET): Canada Soccer has made the postponement official, as the match will kick at 10:30 a.m. ET (7:30 a.m. PT) tomorrow morning .\n\nNothing else was announced as far as what should happen if the pitch remains water logged. That means one of two things: either the federations haven't sorted that out yet, or they are looking to keep that in-house as not to risk publicly announce plans for something that never ends up happening.\n\nHere's to hoping that won't be necessary anyways, and tomorrow morning's kickoff can proceed as planned!\n\nUPDATE (8:25 p.m. ET): **GAME POSTPONED UNTIL TOMORROW**\n\nThe match has been called off for the evening, and they will try again tomorrow. Journalists have announced that the match has been pushed back until 10:30 a.m. ET / 7:30 a.m. PT. No official word from the federation yet, but this seems as concrete as ever.\n\nThey tried to wait it out tonight, but it just wasn't to be.\n\nWhen Canada Soccer make the decision official, we will pass that information along as well as any contingency plan made public as well for if the pitch remains unplayable at the new time.\n\nJamaica vs. Canada has been rescheduled to 10.30 AM ET tomorrow.#CanMNT \u2014 Oliver Platt (@plattoli) November 18, 2023\n\n50 mins to potential kickoff: No word on tonight's match inside an hour until the possible kick time is not good news, as further delay could mean the federation's officials are hashing out alternate plans.\n\nIt sounds like a decision will be made soon on whether tonight's match can go ahead. If it is necessary to push the game back, they would likely try to play tomorrow, but if the pitch is still unplayable at that point, then further action would need to be taken.\n\nIt's possible for them to cancel the first leg and simply play the second leg in Canada, but the teams would have to agree to that. It would put Jamaica at a serious disadvantage in a matchup with significant ramifications \u2014 Copa America qualification \u2014 on the line.\n\n1 hour to potential kickoff: There is still no update on whether this game will take place tonight, or if so, what time.

However, it does appear more and more likely that a game will indeed take place tonight. Will it clear up enough to create a playable surface, or has there been too much rain to proceed safely? We'll find out soon.\n\nUpdate from Concacaf: KO time has been pushed back another hour. Will not kickoff before 9 pm ET tonight. https://t.co/YhPriTlvt7 \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\n1 hour to potential kickoff: There seems to be some positivity around this game taking place. The rain has tapered significantly, prompting some Jamaica fans to take to their seats in celebration. Could we have a game tonight after all?\n\nDespite it all, the vibes are still good here in Jamaica! \ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/z9uCZaKhFs \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023\n\n1 hour 30 minutes to potential kick: Some are speculating that, since the rain could taper off by 8 p.m. ET, that this match could indeed be played, just at a significantly delayed kickoff time, such as 9 p.m. ET. We continue to stand by for more official updates from Canada Soccer.\n\nIf played, the rain-soaked conditions could rival those of the match Canada played in Honduras in the summer of 2022, which was wet and wild.\n\n50 mins 1 hour 50 mins to potential kick: ** Tonight's match will not kick off on time**\n\nOur first true update from Canada Soccer concerning tonight's match states that kickoff has been pushed back at least an hour. The statement claims that the match will not kickoff before 8 p.m. ET, language which seems to leave the possibility open for further postponements or even calling off the game. We will keep you updated as we get more information.\n\nUPDATE: Tonight's #CanMNT vs. Jamaica @CNationsLeague Match will not kickoff before 8PM ET due to \"on-field issues\"\n\n\n\nWhich looks like this \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/iPhqIdvgCo \u2014 OneSoccer (@onesoccer) November 17, 2023\n\n1 hour to kickoff: Lineups have yet to be released, and the likelihood of this match being played seems to be thinning by the moment. The Canada Soccer social media admin just went on Instagram Live to show the conditions at Independence Park, and they are apocalyptic. The individual said on the live social media broadcast that \"it's not looking likely\" the game will be played.\n\nThe @CanadaSoccerEN admin just went live on Instagram to showcase the state of the pitch ahead of tonight\u2019s #CanMNT match\ud83d\ude02\n\n\n\nTo sum it up: oof pic.twitter.com/FRlizvoajM \u2014 Alexandre Gangu\u00e9-Ruzic (@AlexGangueRuzic) November 17, 2023\n\n1 hour 15 mins to kick: The weather in Kingston is torrential, and it's been raining hard for quite some time now. It's at the point where you wonder if this match will even take place, and there seems to be some initial chatter of it possibly being called off.

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nA hospital in Nebraska that matches teenage suicide survivors with a \"caring contact\" says the program has seen positive results in preventing young patients from taking their own lives.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind program provides follow-up care in the form of handwritten, personalized notes from the hospital's social work staff after the teens are discharged.\n\nWHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES NEW FUNDING FOR TEEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS: \u2018WILL HELP SAVE LIVES\u2019\n\nThe notes are sent one month, two months, three months, six months, nine months and one year after discharge \u2014 and the former patients are able to write notes back as well.\n\nSabrina Schalley, director of care coordination at Children's Nebraska, a pediatric hospital and medical center in Omaha, Nebraska, told Fox News Digital that Caring Contacts was inspired by a similar program for adult survivors of suicide.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Schalley brought the idea of personalized follow-up care to the emergency department's social workers, \"and they all liked the idea of the Caring Contacts.\"\n\nThe program was set to begin on May 1, 2020 \u2014 and that timing would turn out to be rather providential.\n\n\"We had no idea when we started that COVID was around the corner and the impact that would have on children's mental health,\" said Schalley.\n\n\"We quickly became so grateful for the intervention.\"\n\nTEEN GIRLS ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AT RECORD LEVELS, WITH MANY 'PERSISTENTLY SAD,' DATA REVEALS\n\nIn the years since the COVID pandemic began, children and teens are experiencing depression and anxiety more than ever before, according to Schalley.\n\n\"Here at Children\u2019s, our patients ages 11 and older are screening at risk of depression and/or suicide at nearly 30%,\" she said.\n\nEach patient who receives a mental health assessment in the emergency department at Children's Nebraska is offered the chance to participate in Caring Contacts, said Schalley.\n\nAbout 98% of families agree to join the program, she said.\n\nnext Image 1 of 6\n\nprev next Image 2 of 6\n\nprev next Image 3 of 6\n\nprev next Image 4 of 6\n\nprev next Image 5 of 6\n\nprev Image 6 of 6\n\n\"These are individuals who arrive due to suicide ideation or suicide gesture or who screen positive for suicide risk through the universal screening tool that all emergency department patients ages 11 and older receive,\" Schalley told Fox News Digital.\n\nParents or legal guardians then sign a release form, which allows social workers at the hospital to keep in contact with the patient over the next year.\n\nPreviously, teenage patients who attempted suicide received no further contact from Children's Nebraska after they were discharged from the emergency department, according to the hospital's website.\n\nThere was \"no opportunity for Children\u2019s Hospital staff to provide ongoing encouragement and support for patients struggling with mental health needs,\" as stated on the site.\n\nNationally, about 27% of suicide survivors will make another attempt, said Schalley, but Children\u2019s Nebraska\u2019s numbers are now much lower.\n\n\"Thankfully, for the first three years of the program \u2026 7% of enrolled patients are seen in a health care environment for a subsequent attempt,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\nTIKTOK TELEHEALTH? TEENS PUT AT RISK BY SELF-DIAGNOSING MENTAL HEALTH ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nOn a national level, anywhere from 31% to 55% of pediatric patients who are taken to the emergency department for a suicide attempt will receive some sort of follow-up within 30 days.\n\n\"One hundred percent of patients enrolled in Caring Contacts are receiving follow-up,\" noted Schalley.\n\n\"The program normalizes the struggles and challenges of mental health and stresses the importance of ongoing treatment.\"\n\nSchalley credits the success of Caring Contacts to a multitude of factors, she told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The program normalizes the struggles and challenges of mental health and stresses the importance of ongoing treatment,\" she said. \"It provides positive coping skills and words of encouragement.\"\n\nPlus, the program \"provides the ability for the youth to maintain a positive, trusting relationship with the social worker,\" said Schalley.\n\nTEEN GIRLS DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS NEED \u2018CONNECTION\u2019 MOST, DOCTORS SAY\n\nUnexpected beneficiaries of the Caring Contacts program are the staff members who write the cards.\n\nParticipating in Caring Contacts has \"provided [staff] with an avenue to receive responses from the youth regarding updates on how they have progressed and hear feedback on their experience from the initial encounter,\" said Schalley.\n\nMackenzie Parks, a licensed clinical social worker at Children's Nebraska, said the families she encountered were \"touched and flattered\" that the hospital would offer follow-up support.\n\n\"The letters I\u2019ve received in return are really telling about the impact the program has on their well-being and hope for the future,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"I also feel that it helps families know that we truly do care about them when we\u2019re assessing them \u2014 not just because it\u2019s our job, but because we really want them to be safe,\" Parks added.\n\nTEEN GIRLS SPEND MORE TIME ON \u2018SENSITIVE\u2019 SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT THAT CAN HARM MENTAL HEALTH, REPORT SAYS\n\nEva Doescher, a licensed clinical social worker in Nebraska, shared similar feedback on her past Caring Contacts experiences.\n\n\"Caring Contacts gives me a chance to slow down and learn from the powerful, short moments that I get to connect with patients and their families,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"I feel that it helps families know we truly do care about them when we\u2019re assessing them \u2013 not just because it\u2019s our job, but because we really want them to be safe.\"\n\n\"Caring Contacts helps me make meaning from every interaction I have with the kids and families \u2014 that\u2019s my \u2018why,\u2019 and what keeps me going,\" added Doescher.\n\nTo Schalley's knowledge, Children's Nebraska is the first pediatric emergency department to implement a program like Caring Contacts; but she hopes it will not be the last.\n\n\"We have created a replication kit to provide other hospitals and organizations with information on how they can implement the program,\" she said, noting that Children's Nebraska has presented the Caring Contacts concept at conferences and received interest from other facilities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nSchalley suspects that the \"intentionality\" and deliberately low-tech communication between social workers and teens is another reason the program has worked so well.\n\n\"It recognizes the impact of a child or adolescent telling their story to a stranger in an emergency room during a time of crisis,\" she said. \"Before, it was unlikely that the patient would hear from that social worker again.\"\n\n\"In our high-tech world, written words from a caring adult stand out and make a difference.\"\n\nNow, that same social worker will send personal notes to the patient for a year, \"offering unconditional caring and support along the way of their mental health journey.\"\n\n\"The cards are tangible and many of the patients report hanging them up in their rooms, keeping them in their cars or backpacks, and reading them aloud to their friends or family,\" said Schalley.\n\nThe cards could also work to save lives, as \"most kids who make a suicide attempt go from thought to action in 10 minutes or less,\" said Schalley.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Imagine the power of having a card to reread \u2026 telling you that you are worthy from someone you met once,\" she said. \"That\u2019s life-changing.\"\n\nSchalley added, \"In our high-tech world, written words from a caring adult stand out and make a difference.\""

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nWill Smith has spoken out about his \u201ctumultuous\u201d relationship with his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, while speaking to a crowd of fans in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe 55-year-old actor took the stage at the Enoch Pratt Free Library on 18 October, as he made an appearance at a press event for his wife\u2019s book, Worthy, alongside their two children \u2013 Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. His recent comments come after Jada made major revelations about their marriage in her memoir, including how she and Will have been separated for seven years.\n\nDuring the event in Baltimore, Will began by speaking to the crowd about his love and admiration for his partner, who he married in 1997. \u201cI just really wanted to come out and just be here and hold it down for you the way you have held it down for me,\u201d he said during the event, as reported by The Baltimore Sun.\n\nThe King Richard star went on to describe the challenges and achievements he\u2019s had throughout his marriage, adding: \u201cWe have had a very, very long and tumultuous [relationship]. We call it \u2018brutiful.\u2019 It was brutal and beautiful at the same time.\"\n\nAt another point during the event, Will referred to his union with Jada as a \u201csloppy public experiment in unconditional love,\u201d according to the Baltimore Banner. He went on to explain that he\u2019s \u201chappier than [he\u2019s] ever been in [his] entire life\u201d and praised Jada for continuing to be by his side.\n\n\u201cI have achieved every single thing I have ever wanted in my entire life. There is not one thing left that I desire in this world - all of the awards, all of the money, the family - everything I\u2019ve ever dreamed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those dreams were largely built on the foundation of Jada\u2019s sacrifices. There were many times when Jada put her career aside so I could follow the dreams of mine.\u201d\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star thanked his wife for putting him \u201cbefore herself\u201d and for maintaining a good relationship with his ex-wife Sheree Zampino. Will and Zampino share a 30-year-old son, Trey Smith, who was also present for the book event at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Speaking to the crowd, Will said that Jada\u2019s positive relationship with Zampino allowed all three of his children the chance to grow up together.\n\n\u201cCan you show up and love somebody for the rest of your life, even when you don\u2019t agree with them?\u201d he asked. \u201cJada is the best friend I have ever had on this planet and I am going to show up for her and support her for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Will has opened up about his relationship, as it\u2019s continued to make headlines. Earlier this week, he appeared to mock the publicity storm surrounding him and Jada in a video titled \u201cOfficial statement\u201d shared on Instagram. \u201cSo, here\u2019s the thing. My opinion is... uh\u2026\u201d the actor said, before sneezing into the crook of his arm. As he sneezed, the video comically zoomed out to show several different landscapes including lakes and mountains.\n\nPrior to sharing the video, Smith showed his support for his partner and her success in a statement toThe New York Times. During the interview, the outlet noted that Smith said his wife\u2019s memoir \u201ckind of woke him up\u201d and that he has now realised she is more \u201cresilient, clever and compassionate than he\u2019d understood\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an interview with People published on 10 October, Jada first revealed that she and her husband were living separately. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\n\nHowever, during an appearance on the Today show on 16 October, Jada clarified to Hoda Kotb that she and the Suicide Squad actor are \u201cworking hard\u201d and are \u201cconcentrating on healing\u201d to get their relationship to a better place.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no finding another great love, and I think that\u2019s the point,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we are in a place now that we are in a deep, healing space. And we are really concentrating on healing the relationship between us.\u201d\n\nThe Girls Trip star continued: \u201cThere\u2019s no divorce on paper. We really have been working hard. That\u2019s the whole thing. We are working very hard at bringing our relationship together. Back to a life partnership.\u201d"

    "body": "To hear the hype from vendors, you would think that enterprise buyers are all in when it comes to generative AI. But like any newer technology, large companies tend to move cautiously. Throughout this year, as vendors feverishly announced new generative AI-fueled products, CIOs took note.\n\nSome companies have actually been looking to cut back on spending, or at least stay even, not necessarily looking for new ways to spend money. The big exception is when technology enables companies to operate more efficiently, and do more with less.\n\nGenerative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it\u2019s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you\u2019re building your own software internally.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s important for the folks implementing the technology to understand if they are getting a return on their investment. A July Morgan Stanley survey of large company CIOs found that many were proceeding cautiously, with 56% of respondents reporting that generative AI was having an impact on their investment priorities, but only 4% had actually launched significant projects. In fact, most were still in the evaluation or proof of concept phase. This may be a fast moving area, but it fits with what we\u2019re hearing in conversations with CIOs as well.\n\nThat said, much like the consumerization of IT a decade ago, CIOs are under pressure to deliver the kind of experiences people are seeing when they play with ChatGPT online, says Jon Turow, a partner at Madrona Ventures.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s undeniable that enterprise employees, who are the internal customers of the CIO or CTO, have all tried ChatGPT and they know what amazing looks like. They know where it\u2019s early, and they know where it\u2019s inspiring, and for lack of a better word, where they see greatness. And so CIOs are under pressure to deliver that level,\u201d Turow told TechCrunch.\n\nIt has created a tension between this desire to please the internal customers, especially when some of that pressure could be coming from the CEO, and a CIO\u2019s natural tendency to move cautiously, even with something as potentially transformative as generative AI. That\u2019s going to take setting up some structure and organization around how this gets implemented over time, says Jim Rowan, principal at Deloitte, who is working with clients around how to build generative AI across companies in an organized fashion.\n\n\u201cA lot of the way we\u2019re working with companies is thinking about what is the infrastructure that they need to be successful. By infrastructure, I don\u2019t necessarily mean technology, but who are the people, what are the processes and the governance\u2026and giving them the capabilities to set that up,\u201d Rowan said. A big part of that is talking about use cases and how to use the technology to address a given problem.\n\nThis is in line with how CIOs we spoke to are approaching implementing this in their organizations. Monica Caldas, CIO at insurance company Liberty Mutual, started with a few-thousand-person proof of concept, and is looking for ways to expand that for her 45,000 employee company.\n\n\u201cWe know generative AI will continue to play a critical role in virtually every part of our company, so we\u2019re investing in many use cases to further develop and refine them in service of supporting our employees and giving them better internal capabilities,\u201d she said.\n\nMike Haney, CIO at Battelle, a firm focused on science and technology, has also been exploring generative AI use cases this year. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been doing this whole push for AI over the last maybe six or nine months and we\u2019re at the point right now where we\u2019re building specific use cases for each different team and function within the firm.\u201d He cautions that it\u2019s early, and they are still exploring ways in which it can help, but so far the results have been good in terms of offering more efficient ways to do things.\n\nKathy Kay, executive VP and CIO at Principal Financial Group, a financial services company, says her company started from scratch with a study group. \u201cSo any employees who had an interest or passion, we allowed them to join so there\u2019s about 100 people. It\u2019s a combination of engineers and business people, and we are curating probably 25 use cases now that they\u2019ve gone through, and three will be going into production [soon],\u201d she said.\n\nSharon Mandell, CIO at Juniper Networks, says that her company is participating in an initial pilot with Microsoft around Copilot for Office 365, and anecdotally, she has heard a range of feedback from people who love it to those who are less impressed, but she says trying to measure increased productivity remains a challenge, even with Microsoft beginning to provide dashboards that at least show the level of adoption and usage.\n\n\u201cThe hard thing about this is you don\u2019t have data on people\u2019s level of productivity. So no matter what, you\u2019re using somewhat anecdotal information until you get really good at understanding these dashboards from Microsoft showing you how people are using it,\u201d she said.\n\nAs companies hear about the potential power of generative AI, it\u2019s only natural that they would want to learn more about it and put it to work to help their organizations run more efficiently, but at the same time, executives are right to be somewhat cautious, recognizing that these are still early days and they have to learn through experimentation if this is truly transformative technology."

    "body": "You cannot escape conversations about AI no matter how far or fast you run. Hyperbole abounds around what current AI tech will be able to do (revolutionize every industry!) and what current AI tech will be able to do (take over the world!). Closer to the ground, TechCrunch+ is working to understand where startups might find footholds in the market by levering large language models (LLMs), a recent and impactful new method of creating artificially intelligent software.\n\nHow AI will play in startup land is not a new topic of conversation. A few years back, one venture firm asked how AI-focused startups would monetize and whether they would suffer from impaired margins due to costs relating to running models on behalf of customers. That conversation died down, only to come roaring back in recent quarters as it became clear that while LLM technology is quickly advancing, it\u2019s hardly cheap to run in its present form.\n\nBut costs are only one area where we have unanswered questions. We are also incredibly curious about how startups should approach building tools for AI technologies, how defensible startup-focused AI work will prove, and how upstart tech companies should charge for AI-powered tooling.\n\nWith the amount of capital flowing to startups working with and building AI today, it\u2019s critical that we understand the market as best we can. So we asked a number of venture capitalists who are active in the AI investing space to walk us through what they are seeing in the market today.\n\nWhat we learned from the investing side of the house was useful. Rick Grinnell, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, said that within the new AI tech stack, \u201cmost of the opportunity lies in the application layer,\u201d where \u201cthe best applications will harness their in-house expertise to build specialized middle-layer tooling and blend them with the appropriate foundational models.\u201d Startups, he added, can use speed to their advantage as they work to \u201cinnovate, iterate and deploy solutions\u201d to customers.\n\nWill that work prove defensible in the long run? Edward Tsai, a managing partner at Alumni Ventures, told us that he had a potentially \u201ccontroversial opinion that VCs and startups may want to temporarily reduce their focus on defensibility and increase their focus on products that deliver compelling value and focusing on speed to market.\u201d Presuming massive TAM, that could work!\n\nRead on for answers to all our questions from:\n\nRick Grinnell, founder and managing partner, Glasswing Ventures\n\nThere are several layers to the emerging LLM stack, including models, pre-training solutions and fine-tuning tools. Do you expect startups to build striated solutions for individual layers of the LLM stack, or pursue a more vertical approach?\n\nIn our proprietary view of the GenAI tech stack, we categorize the landscape into four distinct layers: foundation model providers, middle-tier companies, end-market or top-layer applications, and full stack or end-to-end vertical companies.\n\nWe think that most of the opportunity lies in the application layer, and within that layer, we believe that in the near future, the best applications will harness their in-house expertise to build specialized middle-layer tooling and blend them with the appropriate foundational models. These are \u201cvertically integrated\u201d or \u201cfull-stack\u201d applications. For startups, this approach means a shorter time-to-market. Without negotiating or integrating with external entities, startups can innovate, iterate and deploy solutions at an accelerated pace. This speed and agility can often be the differentiating factor in capturing market share or meeting a critical market need before competitors.\n\nOn the other hand, we view the middle layer as a conduit, connecting the foundational aspects of AI with the refined specialized application layer. This part of the stack includes cutting-edge capabilities, encompassing model fine-tuning, prompt engineering and agile model orchestration. It\u2019s here that we anticipate the rise of entities akin to Databricks. Yet, the competitive dynamics of this layer present a unique challenge. Primarily, the emergence of foundation model providers expanding into middle-layer tools heightens commoditization risks. Additionally, established market leaders venturing into this space further intensify the competition. Consequently, despite a surge in startups within this domain, clear winners still need to be discovered.\n\nCompanies like Datadog are building products to support the expanding AI market, including releasing an LLM observability tool. Will efforts like what Datadog has built (and similar output from large/incumbent tech powers) curtail the market area where startups can build and compete?\n\nLLM observability falls within the \u201cmiddle layer\u201d category, acting as a catalyst for specialized business applications to use foundational models. Incumbents like Datadog, New Relic and Splunk have all produced LLM observability tools and do appear to be putting a lot of R&D dollars behind this, which may curtail the market area in the short-term.\n\nHowever, as we have seen before with the inceptions of the internet and cloud computing, incumbents tend to innovate until innovation becomes stagnant. With AI becoming a household name that finds use cases in every vertical, startups have the chance to come in with innovative solutions that disrupt and reimagine the work of incumbents. It\u2019s still too early to say with certainty who the winners will be, as every day reveals new gaps in existing AI frameworks. Therein lie major opportunities for startups.\n\nHow much room in the market do the largest tech companies\u2019 services leave for smaller companies and startups tooling for LLM deployment?\n\nWhen considering the landscape of foundational layer model providers like Alphabet/Google\u2019s Bard, Microsoft/OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, it\u2019s evident that the more significant players possess inherent advantages regarding data accessibility, talent pool and computational resources. We expect this layer to settle into an oligopolistic structure like the cloud provider market, albeit with the addition of a strong open source contingency that will drive considerable third-party adoption.\n\nAs we look at the generative AI tech stack, the largest market opportunity lies above the model itself. Companies that introduce AI-powered APIs and operational layers for specific industries will create brand-new use cases and transform workflows. By embracing this technology to revolutionize workflows, these companies stand to unlock substantial value.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the market is still far from being crystallized. LLMs are still in their infancy, with adoption at large corporations and startups lacking full maturity and refinement. We need robust tools and platforms to enable broader utilization among businesses and individuals. Startups have the opportunity here to act quickly, find novel solutions to emerging problems, and define new categories.\n\nInterestingly, even large tech companies recognize the gaps in their services and have begun investing heavily in startups alongside VCs. These companies apply AI to their internal processes and thus see the value startups bring to LLM deployment and integration. Consider the recent investments from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Salesforce into companies like Inflection AI and Cohere.\n\nWhat can be done to ensure industry-specific startups that tune generative AI models for a specific niche will prove defensible?\n\nTo ensure industry-specific startups will prove defensible in the rising climate of AI integration, startups must prioritize collecting proprietary data, integrating a sophisticated application layer and assuring output accuracy.\n\nWe have established a framework to assess the defensibility of application layers of AI companies. First, the application must address a real enterprise pain point prioritized by executives. Second, to provide tangible benefits and long-term differentiation, the application should be composed of cutting-edge models that fit the specific and unique needs of the software. It\u2019s not enough to simply plug into OpenAI; rather, applications should choose their models intentionally while balancing cost, compute, and performance.\n\nThird, the application is only as sophisticated as the data that it is fed. Proprietary data is necessary for specific and relevant insights and to ensure others cannot replicate the final product. To this end, in-house middle-layer capabilities provide a competitive edge while harnessing the power of foundational models. Finally, due to the inevitable margin of error of generative AI, the niche market must tolerate imprecision, which is inherently found in subjective and ambiguous content, like sales or marketing.\n\nHow much technical competence can startups presume that their future enterprise AI customers will have in-house, and how much does that presumed expertise guide startup product selection and go-to-market motion?\n\nWithin the enterprise sector, there\u2019s a clear recognition of the value of AI. However, many lack the internal capabilities to develop AI solutions. This gap presents a significant opportunity for startups specializing in AI to engage with enterprise clients. As the business landscape matures, proficiency in leveraging AI is becoming a strategic imperative.\n\nMcKinsey reports that generative AI alone can add up to $4.4 trillion in value across industries through writing code, analyzing consumer trends, personalizing customer service, improving operating efficiencies, and more. Ninety-four percent of business leaders agree AI will be critical to all businesses\u2019 success over the next five years, and total global spending on AI is expected to reach $154 billion by the end of this year, a 27% increase from 2022. The next three years are also expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 27% \u2014 the annual AI spending in 2026 will be over $300 billion. Despite cloud computing remaining critical, AI budgets are now more than double that of cloud computing. Eighty-two percent of business leaders believe the integration of AI solutions will increase their employee performance and job satisfaction, and startups should expect a high level of desire for and experience with AI solutions in their future customers.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ve seen consumption, or usage-based priced tech products\u2019 growth slow in recent quarters. Will that fact lead startups building modern AI tools to pursue more traditional SaaS pricing? (The OpenAI pricing schema based on tokens and usage led us to this question.)\n\nThe trajectory of usage-based pricing has organically aligned with the needs of large language models, given that there is significant variation in prompt/output sizes and resource utilization per user. OpenAI itself racks upward of $700,000 per day on compute, so to achieve profitability, these operation costs need to be allocated effectively.\n\nNevertheless, we\u2019ve seen the sentiment that tying all costs to volume is generally unpopular with end users, who prefer predictable systems that allow them to budget more effectively. Furthermore, it\u2019s important to note that many applications of AI don\u2019t rely on LLMs as a backbone and can provide conventional periodic SaaS pricing. Without direct token calls to the model provider, companies engaged in establishing infrastructural or value-added layers for AI are likely to gravitate toward such pricing strategies.\n\nThe technology is still nascent, and many companies will likely find success with both kinds of pricing models. Another possibility as LLM adoption becomes widespread is the adoption of hybrid structures, with tiered periodic payments and usage limits for SMBs and uncapped usage-based tiers tailored to larger enterprises. However, as long as large language technology remains heavily dependent on the inflow of data, usage-based pricing will unlikely go away completely. The interdependence between data flow and cost structure will maintain the relevance of usage-based pricing in the foreseeable future.\n\nLisa Calhoun, founding managing partner, Valor VC\n\nThere are several layers to the emerging LLM stack, including models, pre-training solutions, and fine-tuning tools. Do you expect startups to build striated solutions for individual layers of the LLM stack, or pursue a more vertical approach?\n\nWhile there are startups specializing in parts of the stack (like Pinecone), Valor\u2019s focus is on applied AI, which we define as AI that is solving a customer problem. Saile.ai is a good example \u2014 it uses AI to generate closeable leads for the Fortune 500. Or Funding U using its own trained dataset to create a more useful credit risk score. Or Allelica, using AI on treatment solutions applied to individual DNA to find the best medical treatment for you personally in a given situation.\n\nCompanies like Datadog are building products to support the expanding AI market, including releasing an LLM observability tool. Will efforts like what Datadog has built (and similar output from large/incumbent tech powers) curtail the market area where startups can build and compete?\n\nTools like Datadog can only help the acceptance of AI tools if they succeed in monitoring AI performance bottlenecks. That in and of itself is probably still largely unexplored territory that will see a lot of change and maturing in the next few years. One key aspect there might be cost monitoring as well since companies like OpenAI charge largely \u201cby the token,\u201d which is a very different metric than most cloud computing.\n\nWhat can be done to ensure industry-specific startups that tune generative AI models for a specific niche will prove defensible?"

    "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23903986/sam-bankman-fried-opening-statements-trial-fraud",
    "body": "I have never seen Sam Bankman-Fried so still as he was during the prosecution\u2019s opening statement. The characteristic leg-jiggling was absent. He barely moved as the prosecutor listed the evidence against him: internal company files, what customers were told, the testimony of his co-conspirators and his own words.\n\nHis hair was shorn, the result of a haircut from a fellow prisoner, the Wall Street Journal reported. He wore a suit bought at a discount at Macy\u2019s, per the Journal; it hung on him. He appeared to have lost some weight.\n\n\u201cAll of that was built on lies.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, at this time last year, had a luxury lifestyle as the CEO of crypto exchange FTX, said the assistant US attorney, Thane Rehn, in the cadence of a high schooler delivering his lines in a student play. Bankman-Fried hung out with Tom Brady. He was on magazine covers, lived in a $30 million penthouse, and spent time with world politicians. \u201cAll of that was built on lies,\u201d Rehn said.\n\nIn his opening statement, Rehn dodged explaining cryptocurrency to the jury. Instead, he punched hard on Bankman-Fried lying and stealing.\n\nBankman-Fried sat almost motionless, occasionally glancing at Rehn, as the prosecutor told the jury that Bankman-Fried sold stock in FTX and borrowed millions from lenders by lying.\n\nThe story Rehn told is familiar to anyone following the news. In May and June of 2022, Alameda Research \u2014 the crypto trading company ostensibly helmed by Caroline Ellison \u2014 didn\u2019t have enough to pay its bills, so it pulled customer money to repay loans. By September, the hole in the FTX balance sheet was so big that customers could never be repaid.\n\nFTX \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.\u201d\n\nWhen CoinDesk published its article in November 2022, people realized FTX was a house of cards, Rehn said. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried tweeted. \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t invest customer assets even in treasuries.\u201d\n\nPointing at Bankman-Fried, Rehn said, \u201cThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people.\u201d\n\nSo how was the defense going to follow it up? I was very curious, having learned yesterday that Bankman-Fried had never been offered a plea deal since he and his attorneys had told the government they wouldn\u2019t negotiate. Surely there would be some manner of evidence, some something, that would have made him so confident.\n\nThere was, instead, a metaphor.\n\nDefense attorney Mark Cohen, with the energy of a patient father telling his obnoxious children a bedtime story, assured us that working at a startup was like building a plane while flying it, and that FTX the plane had flown right into the perfect storm: the crypto crash. Except, uh, he also said this: FTX \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing risk officer\n\nThe problem with this metaphor is that if FTX was a plane, it was a plane flying with a key component missing \u2014 namely, the risk officer, an executive whose job it is to, well, manage risk. This is sort of an important thing, as risks can be anything from reputational to regulatory to financial.\n\nFTX was named such as it was because it was a futures exchange, which, to borrow a phrase from Bloomberg\u2019s Matt Levine, \u201csits between the winners and losers of bets.\u201d That means FTX can\u2019t pay out what it owes the winners unless the losers pay up. Risk management is a crucial part of the business; risk officers exist to identify business\u2019 potential risks, monitor, and mitigate them. This is to say nothing of the regulatory risks around crypto.\n\nAs Cohen droned on about airplanes, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing risk officer. Bringing it up, I thought, was a tremendous mistake. The prosecution hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Either Bankman-Fried is stupid \u2014 unlikely \u2014 or he deliberately didn\u2019t hire a risk officer. Was he worried about what one might find?\n\nSure, as Cohen put it, Bankman-Fried was a math nerd who didn\u2019t party. That paints a picture of someone who\u2019s pretty deliberate, particularly since he immediately left MIT and went to work on Wall Street. If he had been a party-hardy trainwreck, I could see overlooking a risk officer in order to do another line, or a supermodel, or something else important. Why was the defense bringing this up?\n\nBut as Cohen tried to tell me that FTX\u2019s and Alameda\u2019s business relationships were \u201creasonable under the circumstances,\u201d the lack of risk officer kept elbowing me in the ribs. \u201cSam acted in good faith and took reasonable business measures\u201d is a pretty hard pill to swallow with that in mind.\n\nMan, it\u2019s no good when your defense lawyer has just made you sound worse than the prosecution already did. And while Cohen tried to make the common white-collar defense argument that Bankman-Fried, as CEO, was simply too busy to oversee what everyone did every day, he just made me more suspicious. That\u2019s why you hire a risk officer and delegate! That\u2019s the whole point! I could barely even hear Cohen blaming Caroline Ellison and Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao for the debacle over the \u201cno risk officer\u201d ringing in my ears.\n\nFollowing the defense\u2019s opening statements, things got still worse for Bankman-Fried. The prosecution called its first witness, Marc-Antoine Julliard, whose money got stuck on FTX. Juilliard, who was born in Paris and lives in London, testified that he trusted FTX because Bankman-Fried came across as a leading figure of the industry. When he was evaluating the exchange, he thought the sheer volume of users was important, too \u2014 at the time, FTX was among the top three biggest exchanges. Plus, major VC firms had invested, and \u201cthey don\u2019t commit hundreds of millions without doing due diligence, checking the books, the accountancy of the firm, going through several compliance process[es], so that was a vote of confidence for me,\u201d Juilliard said. (Evidently he had not paid attention to the Elizabeth Holmes trial.)\n\nHe also noted FTX\u2019s glossy ads \u2014 featuring Gisele B\u00fcndchen, for instance \u2014 suggested a very high budget. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to spend that much money unless FTX had very strong financials, Juilliard figured. He opened an account, transferred in both regular money and cryptocurrency, and used the exchange to execute his plan: buying Bitcoin to sell back in five to ten years at higher prices.\n\nIt is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone\n\nIn November 2022, things went bad for Julliard. He followed Bankman-Fried on Twitter, and read aloud the \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d tweets, along with \u201cFTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don\u2019t invest client assets\u201d and a few others, which gave Julliard the impression that his money was there \u2014 the problem might have been technical (anti-spam measures) or regulatory. When he tried to get his money out on November 8th, it was too late. We saw screenshots of his withdrawal attempts: $20,000 USD and about 4 Bitcoin, which were worth about $20,000 at the time: about $100,000 money, inaccessible.\n\nIt is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone, but Cohen tried anyway. He noted that Julliard was a licensed commodities broker, who was trading in crypto because he didn\u2019t have to disclose it; that Julliard knew that crypto was new and risky, and that Julliard didn\u2019t review the terms of service agreement he\u2019d assented to when making his FTX account.\n\nWell, sure, but so what?\n\nThe next witness called was Bankman-Fried\u2019s former college (and FTX) roommate, Adam Yedidia, about whom I expect I will have much more to say tomorrow."

    "body": "As artificial intelligence gains an ever-widening role in the medical field, the Mayo Clinic has recently appointed a new executive to lead the health system\u2019s efforts in that area.\n\nRadiologist Bhavik Patel, M.D., has been named chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO) for Mayo Clinic Arizona . Before joining the clinic in 2021, Patel practiced at Duke University Medical Center and Stanford University Medical Center.\n\nDr. Richard Gray, CEO of Mayo Clinic Arizona, announced the hire on LinkedIn, noting the organization has only \"begun to scratch the surface of AI's potential in medicine.\"\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n\nIn his new role, Patel will lead Mayo Clinic\u2019s Advanced AI and Innovation Hub.\n\nHe'll focus on expanding AI-based solutions throughout the organization, according to a press release.\n\nA growing number of health care organizations are hiring individuals in high-level AI roles, said Dr. Harvey Castro, a Dallas, Texas-based emergency medicine physician and AI expert \u2014 but it could be a challenge to fill them.\n\n\"We will likely see a huge increase in these roles, but may not have enough AI doctors to fill this space,\" Castro told Fox News Digital.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AI\n\nApproximately 5,000 U.S. doctors have AI and data science knowledge after undergoing formal training in these fields, he estimated.\n\nWhy is the chief AI officer role important?\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Patel described AI as a \"transformative force that has the potential to revolutionize health care delivery, research and operations.\"\n\nGiven AI\u2019s sweeping impact and fast growth, Mayo Clinic\u2019s new CAIO said there is a need for a dedicated leadership position to ensure \"clear direction and alignment with broader organizational goals.\"\n\nThe chief AI officer is also responsible for balancing the technology\u2019s risks and benefits, Patel noted.\n\n\"The chief AI officer is not just a technocrat, but a visionary leader.\"\n\n\"While AI brings forth myriad benefits, it also carries inherent risks,\" he said. \"A CAIO provides the necessary oversight to ensure that the implementation of AI is ethical, responsible and in line with regulatory guidelines.\"\n\nA chief AI officer also \"bridges the knowledge gap,\" he said, helping teams understand and harness the technology\u2019s power.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HELPS DOCTORS PREDICT PATIENTS\u2019 RISK OF DYING, STUDY FINDS: \u2018SENSE OF URGENCY\u2019\n\nThe role is also important in terms of maximizing the use of resources, fostering collaboration across departments and keeping up with future health tech trends, Patel added.\n\n\"Their expertise is critical in ensuring that the organization remains on the cutting edge of technological advancements while safeguarding patient welfare,\" he said.\n\n\"In essence, the chief AI officer is not just a technocrat, but a visionary leader, ensuring that the organization navigates the AI-driven paradigm shift in health care with agility, responsibility and a patient-centric approach.\"\n\nCastro agreed that the importance of this role is evident as AI becomes a pivotal part of health care.\n\n\"A chief AI officer can oversee the use and development of AI technologies , ensuring that they are leveraged effectively for patient care, data management and other applications,\" he said.\n\nDaily functions of a chief AI officer\n\nA chief AI officer has several core functions, according to Castro.\n\nGOOGLE CLOUD AND MAYO CLINIC SET TO DISRUPT HEALTH CARE WITH GENERATIVE AI\n\nEducating the health care community is one focus.\n\n\"This person should ensure that staff and stakeholders are informed about AI technologies and their applications,\" he said.\n\nDeveloping and implementing the algorithms used in the AI solutions is also a key part of the job, said Castro.\n\nThe CAIO must understand and analyze data derived from AI to inform decision-making and strategy.\n\n\"This role also entails managing the use of AI across the organization, ensuring that it aligns with regulatory standards and organizational goals,\" Castro said.\n\nStrategy development is also inherent to the chief AI officer\u2019s job.\n\nNEW AI-GENERATED COVID DRUG ENTERS PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS: \u2018EFFECTIVE AGAINST ALL VARIANTS\u2019\n\n\"This involves formulating strategies for the implementation and utilization of AI in various health care aspects, such as patient care, data analysis and operational efficiency,\" said Castro.\n\nIn Patel\u2019s case, he said the heart of his new role is to \"ensure that our AI direction seamlessly integrates with and reinforces our organizational values.\"\n\nSome of Patel\u2019s day-to-day functions include:\n\nOverseeing the identification, vetting and integration of AI solutions for various clinical and administrative functions\n\nUsing AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, optimize treatment paths and enhance the patient experience\n\nEngaging with stakeholders to gather insights, feedback and expertise\n\nEnsuring that all AI algorithms are transparent, free from biases, and designed in the best interests of patients and their communities\n\nFacilitating training sessions, workshops and awareness campaigns to ensure that everyone is up-to-date and empowered to harness AI's potential\n\n\"In essence, my role as chief AI officer is both strategic and operational,\" Patel told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"It's about setting a vision rooted in our values while ensuring the tactical execution of AI projects that drive value to our patients.\"\n\nOne of the tech team\u2019s biggest recent contributions is an AI model that proactively assesses a person's risk of a heart attack , Patel noted.\n\nAS AI SHOWS UP IN DOCTORS' OFFICES, MOST PATIENTS ARE GIVING PERMISSION AS EXPERTS ADVISE CAUTION\n\n\"This model uses data from chest CT exams \u2014 often conducted for unrelated health issues, such as COVID or lung nodules \u2014 and identifies future heart disease risk, which unfortunately even expert physicians can't discern from the scan,\" he said.\n\n\"The model helps cardiologists prevent potential heart attacks rather than treating them reactively.\"\n\nMayo Clinic has also developed AI models that predict the prognosis of patients with diseases such as colon cancer , detect risks of future cancers using existing medical records, and predict 30-day hospital readmission or hospital-acquired infections, Patel said.\n\n\"AI can pinpoint details that make a significant difference in diagnosis and treatment.\"\n\n\"Our focus is not only to develop these AI models, but to ensure that the benefits of these models reach patients swiftly,\" he added.\n\nKey benefits of AI in health care\n\nPatel said he views AI as a \"powerful instrument\" that helps magnify physicians\u2019 capabilities rather than replacing them.\n\n\"One of AI's primary strengths is its ability to recognize patterns that might escape the human eye,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether it's intricate anomalies in medical imaging or subtle patterns in patient histories, AI can pinpoint details that make a significant difference in diagnosis and treatment.\"\n\nThe technology also helps providers by sifting through and analyzing vast volumes of information, far more than what would be humanly possible, Patel said.\n\nIt also automates mundane and routine tasks, allowing health care professionals to redirect their focus to the patient, he noted.\n\nAI TECH AIMS TO HELP PATIENTS CATCH DISEASE EARLY, EVEN \u2018REVERSE THEIR BIOLOGICAL AGE\u2019\n\nEarly risk detection is another key benefit.\n\n\"AI tools can predict potential health risks by analyzing a combination of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors, facilitating early interventions and potentially saving lives,\" Patel said.\n\nAs well, AI can help enable the delivery of personalized medicine and proactive preventative care, he noted.\n\n\"By analyzing individual genetic makeup combined with lifestyle and environmental factors, treatments can be tailored to the unique needs of each patient,\" Patel said.\n\n\"And by predicting potential health issues before they manifest, we can guide patients on preventive measures, fundamentally changing our approach from cure to prevention.\"\n\nPotential risks and limitations\n\nAI in health care also presents challenges and limitations , Patel acknowledged.\n\nBecause AI is a branch of science, it requires rigorous evaluation before it can be applied by doctors, he said.\n\nAI HEART SCAN AIMS TO CATCH BLOCKAGES YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS: \u2018UNBELIEVABLE BREAKTHROUGH\u2019\n\n\"This ensures that we're not just implementing technology for the sake of innovation, but are truly enhancing patient care in a tangible, evidence-based manner.\"\n\nAI models also run the risk of bias, he warned.\n\n\"By recognizing AI\u2019s limitations and actively working to address them, we can harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of our health care system.\"\n\n\"AI models are, by nature, a reflection of the data they're trained on,\" he said. \"If this data contains biases \u2014 whether racial, gender-based or from other sources \u2014 the models may perpetuate these biases.\"\n\nThere is the additional risk that humans will become overly reliant on AI, leading to a phenomenon called \"automation bias.\"\n\n\"Essentially, this means giving undue weight to AI-generated results without adequate human scrutiny,\" Patel said.\n\n\"In health care, understanding the \u2018why\u2019 behind a diagnosis or recommendation is as crucial as the result,\" he said. \"As providers, we must always contextualize AI outputs within the broader patient picture, leveraging our clinical judgment and experience.\"\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HELPS DOCTORS PREDICT PATIENTS\u2019 RISK OF DYING, STUDY FINDS: \u2018SENSE OF URGENCY\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s important to protect data privacy and security as well, Patel noted, due to the large amounts of information that must be fed to AI models.\n\nWhile AI's capabilities are \"immense and ever-growing,\" Patel emphasized that AI\u2019s role is to be an ally.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Humans caring for humans is the bedrock of health care \u2014 AI strengthens that foundation, but doesn\u2019t replace it,\"

    "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/27/cppa-admt-draft-rules/",
    "body": "California\u2019s Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) is preparing for its next trick: Putting guardrails on AI.\n\nThe state privacy regulator, which has an important role in setting rules of the road for digital giants given how much of Big Tech (and Big AI) is headquartered on its sun-kissed soil, has today published draft regulations for how people\u2019s data can be used for what it refers to as automated decisionmaking technology (ADMT*). Aka AI.\n\nThe draft represents \u201cby far the most comprehensive and detailed set of rules in the \u2018AI space'\u201d, Ashkan Soltani, the CPPA\u2019s exec director, told TechCrunch. The approach takes inspiration from existing rules in the European Union, where the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has given individuals rights over automated decisions with a legal or significant impact on them since coming into force back in May 2018 \u2014 but aims to build on it with more specific provisions that may be harder for tech giants to wiggle away from.\n\nThe core of the planned regime \u2014 which the Agency intends to work on finalizing next year, after a consultation process \u2014 includes opt-out rights, pre-use notice requirements and access rights which would enable state residents to obtain meaningful information on how their data is being used for automation and AI tech.\n\nAI-based profiling could even fall in scope of the planned rules, per the draft the CPPA has presented today. So \u2014 assuming this provision survives the consultation process and makes it into the hard-baked rules \u2014 there could be big implications for US adtech giants like Meta which has a business model that hinges on tracking and profiling users to target them with ads.\n\nSuch firms could be required to offer California residents the ability to deny their commercial surveillance, with the proposed law stating businesses must provide consumers with the ability to opt-out of their data being processed for behavioral advertising. The current draft further stipulates that behavioral advertising use-cases cannot make use of a number of exemptions to the opt-out right that may apply in other scenarios (such as if ADMT is being used for security or fraud prevention purposes, for example).\n\nThe CPPA\u2019s approach to regulating ADMT is risk-based, per Soltani. This echoes another piece of in-train EU legislation: the AI Act \u2014 a dedicated risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence which has been on the table in draft form since 2021 but is now at a delicate stage of co-legislation, with the bloc\u2019s lawmakers clashing over the not-so-tiny-detail of how (or even whether) to regulate Big AI, among several other policy disputes on the file.\n\nGiven the discord around the EU\u2019s AI Act, as well as the ongoing failure of US lawmakers to pass a comprehensive federal privacy law \u2014 since there\u2019s only so much presidential Executive Orders can do \u2014 there\u2019s a plausible prospect of California ending up as one of the top global rulemakers on AI.\n\nThat said, the impact of California\u2019s AI rules is likely to remain local, given its focus on affording protections and controls to state residents. In-scope companies might choose to go further \u2014 such as, say, offering the same package of privacy protections to residents of other US states. But that\u2019s up to them. And, bottom line, the CPPA\u2019s reach and enforcement is tied to the California border.\n\nIts bid to tackle AI follows the introduction of GDPR-inspired privacy rules, back in 2019, with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) coming into effect in early 2020. Since then the Agency has been pushing to go further. And, in fall 2020, a ballot measure secured backing from state residents to reinforce and redefine parts of the privacy law. The new measures laid out in draft today to address ADM are part of that effort.\n\n\u201cThe proposed regulations would implement consumers\u2019 right to opt out of, and access information about, businesses\u2019 uses of ADMT, as provided for by the [CCPA],\u201d the CPPA wrote in a press release. \u201cThe Agency Board will provide feedback on these proposed regulations at the December 8, 2023, board meeting, and the Agency expects to begin formal rulemaking next year.\u201d\n\nIn parallel, the regulator is considering draft risk assessment requirements which are intended to work in tandem with the planned ADMT rules. \u201cTogether, these proposed frameworks can provide consumers with control over their personal information while ensuring that automated decisionmaking technologies, including those made from artificial intelligence, are used with privacy in mind and in design,\u201d it suggests.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Vinhcent Le, member of the regulator\u2019s board and of the New Rules Subcommittee that drafted the proposed regulations, added: \u201cOnce again, California is taking the lead to support privacy-protective innovation in the use of emerging technologies, including those that leverage artificial intelligence. These draft regulations support the responsible use of automated decisionmaking while providing appropriate guardrails with respect to privacy, including employees\u2019 and children\u2019s privacy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s being proposed by the CPPA?\n\nThe planned regulations deal with access and opt-out rights in relation to businesses\u2019 use of ADMT.\n\nPer an overview of the draft regulation, the aim is to establish a regime that will let state residents request an opt-out from their data being used for automated decisionmaking \u2014 with a relatively narrow set of exemptions planned where use of the data is necessary (and solely intended) for either: Security purposes (\u201cto prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents\u201d); fraud prevention; safety (\u201cto protect the life and physical safety of consumers\u201d); or for a good or service requested by the consumer.\n\nThe latter comes with a string of caveats, including that the business \u201chas no reasonable alternative method of processing\u201d; and must demonstrate \u201c(1) the futility of developing or using an alternative method of processing; (2) an alternative method of processing would result in a good or service that is not as valid, reliable, and fair; or (3) the development of an alternative method of processing would impose extreme hardship upon the business\u201d.\n\nSo \u2014 tl;dr \u2014 a business that intends to use ADMT and is trying to use a (crude) argument that, simply because the product contains automation/AI users can\u2019t opt-out of their data being processed/fed to the models, looks unlikely to wash. At least not without the company going to extra effort to stand up a claim that, for instance, less intrusive processing would not suffice for their use-case.\n\nBasically, then, the aim is for there to be a compliance cost attached to trying to deny consumers the ability to opt-out of automation/AI being applied to their data.\n\nOf course a law that lets consumers opt-out of privacy-hostile data processing is only going to work if the people involved are aware how their information is being used. Hence the planned framework also sets out a requirement that businesses wanting to apply ADMT must provide so-called \u201cpre-use notices\u201d to affected consumers \u2014 so they can decide whether to opt-out of their data being used (or not); or indeed whether to exercise their access right to get more info about the intended use of automation/AI.\n\nThis too looks broadly similar to provisions in the EU\u2019s GDPR which put transparency (and fairness) obligations on entities processing personal data \u2014 in addition to requiring a valid lawful basis for them to use personal data.\n\nAlthough the European regulation contains some exceptions \u2014 such as where info was not directly collected from individuals and fulfilling their right to be informed would be \u201cunreasonably expensive\u201d or \u201cimpossible\u201d \u2014 which may have undermined EU lawmakers\u2019 intent that data subjects should be kept informed. (Perhaps especially in the realm of AI \u2014 and generative AI \u2014 where large amounts of personal data have clearly been scraped off the Internet but web users have not been proactively informed about this heist of their info; see, for example, regulatory action against Clearview AI. Or the open investigations of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.)\n\nThe proposed Californian framework also includes GDPR-esque access rights which will allow state residents to ask a business to provide them with: Details of their use of ADMT; the technology\u2019s output with respect to them; how decisions were made (including details of any human involvement; and whether the use of ADMT was evaluated for \u201cvalidity, reliability and fairness\u201d); details of the logic of the ADMT, including \u201ckey parameters\u201d affecting the output; and how they applied to the individual; information on the range of possible outputs; and info on how the consumer can exercise their other CCPA rights and submit a complaint about the use of ADMT.\n\nAgain, the GDPR provides a broadly similar right \u2014 stipulating that data subjects must be provided with \u201cmeaningful information about the logic involved\u201d in automated decisions that have a significant/legal effect on them. But it\u2019s still falling to European courts to interpret where the line lies when it comes to how much (or how specific the) information algorithmic platforms must hand over in response to these GDPR subject access requests (see, for example, litigation against Uber in the Netherlands where a number of drivers have been trying to get details of systems involved in flagging accounts for potential fraud).\n\nThe CCPA looks to be trying to pre-empt attempts by ADMT companies to evade the transparency intent of providing consumers with access rights \u2014 by setting out, in greater detail, what information they must provide in response to these requests. And while the draft framework does include some exemptions to access rights, just three are proposed: Security, fraud prevention and safety \u2014 so, again, this looks like an attempt to limit excuses and (consequently) expand algorithmic accountability.\n\nNot every use of ADMT will be in-scope of the CCPA\u2019s proposed rules. The draft regulation proposes to set a threshold as follows:\n\nFor a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer (e.g., decisions to provide or deny employment opportunities). Profiling a consumer who is acting in their capacity as an employee, independent contractor, job applicant, or student. Profiling a consumer while they are in a publicly accessible place.\n\nThe Agency also says the upcoming consultation will discuss whether the rules should also apply to: profiling a consumer for behavioral advertising; profiling a consumer the business has \u201cactual knowledge is under the age of 16\u201d (i.e. profiling children); and processing the personal information of consumers to train ADMT \u2014 indicating it\u2019s not yet confirmed how much of the planned regime will apply to (and potentially limit the modus operandi of) adtech and data-scraping generative AI giants.\n\nThe more expansive list of proposed thresholds would clearly make the law bite down harder on adtech giants and Big AI. But, it being California, the CCPA can probably expect a lot of pushback from local giants like Meta and OpenAI, to name two.\n\nThe draft proposal marks the start of the CPPA\u2019s rulemaking process, with the aforementioned consultation process \u2014 which will include a public component \u2014 set to kick off in the coming weeks. So it\u2019s still a ways off a final text. A spokeswoman for the CPPA said it\u2019s unable to comment on a possible timeline for the rulemaking but she noted this is something that will be discussed at the upcoming board meeting, on December 8.\n\nIf the Agency is able to move quickly it\u2019s possible it could have a regulation finalized in the second half of next year. Although there would obviously need to be a grace period before compliance kicks in for in-scope companies \u2014 so 2025 looks like the very earliest for a law to be up and running. And who knows how far developments in AI will have moved on by then.\n\n* The CPPA\u2019s proposed definition for ADMT in the draft framework is \u201cany system, software, or process \u2014 including one derived from machine-learning, statistics, other data-processing or artificial intelligence \u2014 that processes personal information and uses computation as whole or part of a system to make or execute a decision or facilitate human decisionmaking\u201d. Its definition also affirms \u201cADMT includes profiling\u201d \u2014 which is defined as \u201cany form of automated processing of personal information to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person and in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements\u201d"

    "body": "Your time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we love here at Polygon, it\u2019s the Halloween season.\n\nWe cover horror year-round, whether it\u2019s the best horror movies you can stream at home or the best horror movies on Netflix, and generally, we have our finger on the undead pulse of the newest and ghastliest releases in horror. We even have a list of the best horror movies of the year (ranked by scariness, of course).\n\nEven still, Halloween is an especially spooky time of year, and it warrants special attention and celebration.\n\nFor the past three years, Polygon has put together a Halloween countdown calendar, selecting 31 of our staff\u2019s top horror-themed or Halloween-adjacent picks across movies and TV throughout the month of October, all available to watch at home. We\u2019ve loved doing it, so much so that we\u2019re bringing it back again \u2014 this time with a whole new batch of films and shows to choose from.\n\nEvery day for the month of October, we\u2019ll add a new recommendation to this countdown and tell you where you can watch it. So curl up on the couch, dim the lights, and grab some popcorn for a terrifying and entertaining marathon of horrific delights.\n\nOct. 1: Messiah of Evil\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Shudder, Pluto TV, Plex\n\nA undersung classic of \u201970s cosmic horror, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz\u2019s Messiah of Evil is a surreal and nightmarish experience that more than deserves its status as a cult horror classic.\n\nThe film centers on Arletty, a young woman who journeys to the remote coastal town of Point Dume, California, to track down her missing father, a reclusive painter who is plagued by disturbing visions of an impending apocalypse. After crossing paths with an eccentric aristocrat and his groupie companions, the group bears witness to the realization of the painter\u2019s prophecy, as the townspeople are transformed into flesh-eating ghouls and the messiah of evil makes his return to the mortal realm.\n\nAt times convoluted and bizarre, Messiah of Evil is a genuinely entertaining horror thriller filled with memorable scares and chilling set-pieces. From a cross-eyed albino man gleefully devouring a field mouse whole to a unsuspecting woman watching a Western as the theater around her slowly fills with ravenous undead zombies, it\u2019s a dreamy and frightening experience that lands somewhere between the ineffable gothic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and the anti-consumerist allegories of George A. Romero. The horrors hold up over 50 years after it was first released, and with just the right combination of inadvertent silliness and legitimate terror, Messiah of Evil is a satisfying watch and an excellent start to a month of horrors. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nOct. 2: Ginger Snaps\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel, Shudder, Peacock, Vudu, Tubi, Freevee, Plex\n\nThere\u2019s a sizable hole in the monster movie canon: There just aren\u2019t enough good werewolf movies! Ginger Snaps is here to fix that. And if you love Jennifer\u2019s Body, you\u2019re in for a bloody treat.\n\nDirected by future Orphan Black co-creator John Fawcett, Ginger Snaps is a delightfully gruesome story about two sisters. One of them has gotten her period for the first time, and is turned into a werewolf shortly after. Things get messy, fast.\n\nGinger Snaps doesn\u2019t just do a great job filling in the werewolf canon. It\u2019s a grisly body horror story placed onto an effective puberty allegory, with a compelling central sister relationship. If you\u2019ve ever watched something like Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man and thought, This is great and surprisingly gooey, but give me stories like this about teen girls, then Ginger Snaps is for you.\n\nThe movie has amassed a dedicated cult following in the years since its release. You\u2019re next up to join the ranks \u2014 see you at the next full moon! \u2014Pete Volk\n\nOct. 3: Creepshow\n\nWhere to watch: Kanopy\n\nThe new Creepshow home video release \u2014 presented in vibrant 4K UHD Blu-ray \u2014 is the best way to revisit this horror anthology classic. You can see individual bubbles in the foam of the ocean as it slowly drowns Ted Danson. This is why it made our list of the best Blu-rays of 2023.\n\nBut reader, while I\u2019m one of those sickos who obsesses over video resolution and bitrate, I\u2019ll be honest: You don\u2019t need the fanciest version of Creepshow to enjoy its comedic chills. In fact, the most aesthetically harmonious format might be a poorly treated VHS tape that recorded the film off TBS in the mid-1990s.\n\nHorror anthologies have most recently been used to condense as much terror into a tiny package, like chugging a shot glass of hot sauce. Creepshow is a throwback to a softer, more leisurely style of horror \u2014 a middle ground between the plodding tinglers of Poe and contemporary slashers.\n\nPlus, Stephen King performs a one-person show as a hillbilly. So like, that should be enough. \u2014Chris Plante\n\nOct. 4: Pulse\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video\n\nWhat if technology could be used to communicate with the dead? It\u2019s an idea that dates as far back as the spiritualism movement of the late 19th century, and one that takes on a frightening and fascinating dimension in Kiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s post-Y2K horror-thriller Pulse.\n\nAlternating between two storylines, Kurosawa\u2019s film follows a group of young adults and university students as a rash of inexplicable disappearances and suicides occurs around Tokyo. As the protagonists investigate further, they slowly uncover a shocking revelation: The souls of the dead are spilling over into the mortal world and ensnaring their unsuspecting prey through the very infrastructure of the internet. By the time they realize this, however, it\u2019s too late; the unearthly contagion has taken on a life of its own, and the only way to survive is cling to what few connections they have left.\n\nProduced after Kurosawa\u2019s Cure (which we featured on last year\u2019s Halloween calendar), Pulse is widely celebrated as one of the foundational texts in the canon of J-horror cinema, alongside Hideo Nakata\u2019s Ring and Takashi Shimizu\u2019s Ju-on: The Curse. Eerie and methodical, Kurosawa\u2019s film is a nihilistic meditation on technology and human relationships that presages an advent of loneliness in a world growing more and more \u201cconnected\u201d with each passing day. Rife with imagery that will stay with you long after it\u2019s over, Pulse is a tremendous and terrifying movie worth experiencing. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 5: Apostle\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nDon\u2019t confuse Gareth Edwards (director of The Creator and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) with Gareth Evans, director of the Raid movies. If you do, you may sit down to the Netflix-exclusive Apostle expecting expansive, detail-driven science fiction, and be unpleasantly surprised when you get a grimy, extremely gory period piece that goes to startling extremes.\n\nEvans\u2019 mesmerizing Apostle deliberately starts in roughly the same place as the classic 1973 suspense thriller The Wicker Man, with a lone man heading to a remote Welsh island after getting a letter suggesting his sister is being held against her will there by a dangerous cult. Worming his way into the community by pretending to be a convert, Thomas (Dan Stevens, even more feral and intense than he is in The Guest or Beauty and the Beast) inevitably discovers a lot of nasty work going on on the island.\n\nEvans charts his own course with Apostle, veering far from the Wicker Man mold and into much bloodier territory. But he takes advantage of some of the same ideas: the ominous isolation of the island, the close-knit secrecy of its community, the predatory ideas that have flourished there under charismatic leadership. Stevens is particularly terrific in this movie, lunging from one scene to the next like a humanoid wolf who can barely contain his bloodlust. (Thomas has plenty of closely held secrets of his own.) And Evans\u2019 commitment to violent mayhem gives this one some memorable moments that are likely to haunt you later, in the dark. \u2014Tasha Robinson\n\nOct. 6: Dracula 2000\n\nWhere to watch: Max\n\nWith the scars of nu-metal having healed and Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Paramore-infused pop tracks having gone full \u201cvampire,\u201d now is the time to give Gerard Butler\u2019s half-bare-chest take on Dracula the respect it\u2019s due.\n\nMaybe the most Dimension Films movie to ever bear the Dimension Films studio logo (close second: The Faculty), Dracula 2000 finds a group of thieves \u2014 including of-the-moment faces like Omar Epps, Jennifer Esposito, and Shane West! \u2014 transporting a stolen silver coffin from London to New Orleans. They think there\u2019s treasure inside. Are they idiots? Absolutely. And when they find Dracula instead of gold doubloons or whatever, they unleash hell. Overacted, canted-angled, seven-string-guitar-plucking HELL. Luckily, as Dracula hunts down local college student Mary Van Helsing (Justine Waddell), with whom he already shares a psychic connection, Mary\u2019s dad\u2019s new vampire-hunter assistant Simon (young Jonny Lee Miller!) is on his tail.\n\nButler, never more a heartthrob, plays Dracula in a mesmerizing, baroque manner; think Nicolas Cage doing Dracula if this year\u2019s Renfield was emo turn-of-the-millennium trash. And he\u2019s constantly biting unsuspecting B-list actors to add to his army of hot people, who fight the heroes in multiple obligatory scenes of wire-fu. Writer-director Patrick Lussier cuts it all up like it\u2019s the video for \u201cFreak on a Leash,\u201d and, well, objectively, it\u2019s quite unlike most horror movies you can watch today! Enjoyment of Dracula 2000 may vary depending on a tolerance for Hot Topic goofs, but if you don\u2019t catch up with it, you can\u2019t enjoy Lussier\u2019s sequel, Dracula II: Ascension, starring Jason Scott Lee as a martial-arts-fighting priest who kicks Dracula\u2019s ass! \u2014Matt Patches\n\nOct. 7: Prince of Darkness\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough movies about the end of the world. Sure, there are plenty of movies about preventing catastrophe at that scale, but rarely do they have the follow-through to truly get existentially terrifying. Thankfully, John Carpenter is no coward, and he made three movies about different kinds of apocalypses. But while The Thing is the best known, and In the Mouth of Madness is the zaniest, Prince of Darkness might be the scariest of the trilogy.\n\nPrince of Darkness follows a group of college researchers who are sent to study a strange canister found in the basement of a church. The canister is filled with some kind of liquid that defies science, and when it starts to get released, a strange evil seems to come into the world with it.\n\nThis is Carpenter at his most ambitious. While most of this movie is set in just one building, all manner of horror makes its way inside. There are people made of bugs, horrific zombies, an extradimensional Satan, and things even worse to behold. The entire movie is an onslaught of creepy, skin-crawling images, all built out of a unique mythology about the relationship between good and evil that underpins the world. And, most importantly, after this parade of horrors seems to come to an end, Carpenter saves Prince of Darkness\u2019 biggest, weirdest, most dreadful scare for last. \u2014Austen Goslin\n\nOct. 8: Gravity Falls - Northwest Mansion Mystery\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Disney Plus (season 2, episode 10)\n\nThe more time that has passed since Gravity Falls concluded, the more miraculous it feels in hindsight. Alex Hirsch\u2019s paranormal comedy show about 12-year-old twins Dipper and Mabel, who solve supernatural mysteries in their great-uncle\u2019s home in rural Oregon, is the perfect entry point for young horror-loving audiences. It\u2019s a pastiche of The X-Files, Twin Peaks, and Adventure Time all rolled into one, with the freewheeling, funloving spirit of a summer vacation. There\u2019s tons of fantastic episodes to choose from, but if you\u2019re looking for an especially spooky one to get in the Halloween spirit, you can\u2019t go wrong with \u201cNorthwest Mansion Mystery.\u201d\n\nA ghost has taken up residence in the mansion estate of the wealthiest family in Gravity Falls on the eve of their annual party, and Dipper has been enlisted to exorcize it. Upon arriving at the mansion, Dipper and popular girl Pacifica Northwest uncover a dark family secret that\u2019s been buried for generations, one that threatens to not only tarnish the family\u2019s reputation, but engulf the entire town. For a series ostensibly aimed at young children, it\u2019s kind of wild just how scary \u201cNorthwest Mansion Mystery\u201d gets, with taxidermy animals bleeding from their mouths, flaming skeletal lumberjacks, and hapless partygoers being petrified into screaming wooden statues. It\u2019s a blast, and a solid stand-alone episode to introduce new audiences to the all the spooky (and \u201cspoopy\u201d) delights Gravity Falls has to offer. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 9: The Scooby-Doo Project\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube\n\nScooby-Doo got extremely dark for a few years in the early 2000s, which also happened to be the best years of the series since its heyday in the 1970s. But while movies like The Witch\u2019s Ghost and Zombie Island are absolutely excellent (and still hold up), among the most interesting hidden gems of the series is The Scooby-Doo Project.\n\nLike its name implies, this was a parody of The Blair Witch Project that stars the Mystery Inc. gang. Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne set off in the Mystery Machine to the remote woods of Casper County. The movie is filmed in the same documentary style that The Blair Witch Project made iconic, and mostly inserts the gang into live-action locations like real woods or a real town where they interview locals.\n\nThe project was originally created as a bumper to bookend segments of a 1999 Scooby-Doo marathon (just a few months after the movie it was based on was released), but after Cartoon Network saw what the creators put together, it wisely decided to re-air the short segments end-to-end as a movie.\n\nThe Scooby-Doo Project not only stands alongside the original Blair Witch as an impressive and loving parody, but also as a similarly unnerving found-footage horror movie. The gang standing around among live-action backgrounds is creepy enough on its own, but hearing the beloved characters be accosted by unseen forces as they sprint through the woods is downright scary \u2014 particularly if you were a kid watching this for the first time in 1999, well before you saw The Blair Witch Project.\n\nBut the best part of The Scooby-Doo Project comes at the end when, much like the other Scooby-Doo movies of the time, we get a soft implication that the supernatural elements of the story were actually real and the horrors won\u2019t stop when the villain\u2019s mask comes off. It\u2019s a downright haunting ending, and manages to match the excellence of its source material, which is high praise for any horror movie, let alone a Scooby-Doo parody. \u2014AG\n\nOct. 10: Saloum\n\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus\n\nOne of the best movies of 2022 was this criminally underseen Senegalese thriller. Saloum follows three extremely cool mercenaries whose post-mission flight home gets interrupted. The trio find themselves in a mysterious village where something is off, and the tension slowly ramps up into a chaotic finale.\n\nThe trio of lead actors are absolutely magnetic \u2014 Yann Gael (1899), Roger Sallah, and the late Mentor Ba bring the trio of loyal friends who also happen to be extremely deadly professionals fully to life. And with fantastic costume design, a stirring score, and compelling images from award-winning music video director Jean Luc Herbulot, Saloum is 84 minutes of genre-bending excellence.\n\nSaloum first premiered at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival, and the movie went on to win awards at Fantastic Fest and the Vancouver International Film Festival. And yet, way too few people have seen it. This is your chance to correct the record and help make Saloum the cult classic it deserves to be. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 11: Heck\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube\n\nSkinamarink has proven to be one of the most polarizing horror releases of 2023. Kyle Edward Ball\u2019s feature debut about two children trapped alone inside their home by a malevolent entity eschews the formal conventions of traditional cinematography and plot, consisting instead of a series of canted-angle shots of dark hallways and yawning darkness that forces the audience to ruminate on the horrors that lay therein. Personally, I vibed with it heavily, and so it should come as no surprise that I quite enjoyed Ball\u2019s 2020 short film Heck as well.\n\nConceived as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for Skinamarink, the short is told from the perspective of a young child who wakes in the dead of night to the blaring sound of their mother\u2019s television set. With their mother seemingly nowhere to be found, the child is left to their own devices, with no means of either leaving the house or calling for help. As the interminable night drags on, with hours morphing into days morphing into weeks morphing into months of penumbral isolation, the child grows more fearful and feral, resorting to increasingly more desperate acts of disobedience in hopes of rousing their mother from sleep. This effort, however, is ultimately proven to be in vain.\n\nHeck circles the same rough ideas and themes of Skinamarink to different effect, channeling the vulnerability of a child and the horror of abandonment and neglect to create an experimental horror experience that demands the audience\u2019s full attention. It\u2019s a fascinating companion to Skinamarink that shows just how far Ball has come as a director honing in on this particular strain of horror, and makes it all the more intriguing to speculate on what he might conjure up next. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 12: Harper\u2019s Island\n\nWhere to watch: Available to purchase on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\n\nIn theory, slasher TV should be easier to pull off. Episodic structure lends itself well to a slowly dwindling cast, with a killer on the loose and a different death each episode. This, as Lizzie McGuire (as Isabella the pop star) says, is what dreams are made of. And yet, show after show flubs it, because they can\u2019t find interesting enough characters or dilemmas in what should be an endlessly engaging premise.\n\nBut the rules are different on Harper\u2019s Island.\n\nThe small Pacific Northwest island was home to a serial killing where Abby (Elaine Cassidy) lost her mom almost a decade ago. She only returns at the start of the series under the most extreme of circumstances: her best friend Henry\u2019s (Christopher Gorham) wedding. And unfortunately, the island\u2019s deadly legacy is about to get a whole lot worse.\n\nThe thing is: The show is a perfect low-rent masterpiece. Being from 2009, it feels like a time capsule for both bootcut jeans and miniseries. At a tight 13 episodes, Harper\u2019s Island knows what it\u2019s about (killing people) and gets right to it (brutally). And yet, the beauty of Harper\u2019s Island and its antics is how long it\u2019s able to sustain a levelheaded approach to a purely absurd And Then There Were None scenario, right down to how long nobody knows they\u2019re being picked off. Almost no death is like the last, which seems purely impractical from a serial killing perspective but makes for great TV. The episode titles are the onomatopoeias for how people die, for Christ\u2019s sake! It\u2019s all very fun and twisty, as bodies and mystery continue to mount. Harper\u2019s Island makes slasher TV look fun and easy. More TV should be like Harper\u2019s Island. \u2014Zosha Millman\n\nOct. 13: American Horror Story: NYC\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nI have already gone on record about how I cannot look away from the trash fire that is most seasons of American Horror Story. But last season really solidified the reason I even watched the show in the first place. Namely, when AHS is good, it\u2019s really good.\n\nAHS: NYC opens up with a serial killer on the prowl. That, coupled with the leather-clad spectral figure that seems to be haunting the main characters, seems like it\u2019s just typical AHS schlock. But it\u2019s so much more than that. Yes, there is a serial killer who uncannily resembles Jeffrey Dahmer, and the scenes where he stalks and tortures his victims are pretty scary. And yes, there is a leather daddy ghost that has no name or face. And yes, there\u2019s a lot of dubiously consensual BDSM scenes. But the real horror comes from the powerlessness of the queer community in the face of the AIDS crisis.\n\nCreator Ryan Murphy builds this overwhelming, inescapable sense of dread. All AHS seasons hinge on their titular premise, which, more often than not, is a location. It\u2019s not always done effectively, but in NYC, Murphy and the writers heighten the foreboding terror of being alone in a city of millions, of feeling helpless in a crowded room, of knowing that there\u2019s something out to get you but not being able to do anything about that.\n\nThe whole season is surprisingly subdued for AHS (yes, even with the sex cages), and it builds up to a painfully poignant finale scene where, for 10 minutes set to Kraftwerk\u2019s \u201cRadioactivity,\u201d one of the main characters wordlessly trudges through the next 10 years of his life, watching everyone around him slowly succumb to AIDS, as horror and reality blend together. \u2014Petrana Radulovic\n\nOct. 14: Cat People\n\nWhere to watch: Max\n\nWant to be a smarter horror fan this October? Watch the movie that originated the modern jump scare, and then impress people at Halloween parties with this knowledge.\n\nCat People is not only a key part of horror movie history, it\u2019s a delightfully dark and sexy time positively radiating with atmosphere. The movie follows a woman (Simone Simon) who is caught between her desire for a new man in her life (Kent Smith) and her belief that she is cursed to turn into a panther if she becomes aroused. And at 73 minutes, it\u2019s one of the shorter horror classics you can watch this fall.\n\nNow for that jump scare origin. There\u2019s a tense sequence in this movie where one character stalks another. Director Jacques Tourneur lets the tension build to an unbearable level before surprising the audience with the sudden appearance of a bus. Often considered the first example of the modern jump scare, it was called the \u201cLewton Bus\u201d after producer Val Lewton, who used the technique again in later movies. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 15: The Neon Demon\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Hoopla, Freevee\n\nModeling is a cutthroat industry, and that goes double in Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s 2016 horror movie The Neon Demon.\n\nThe movie follows Elle Fanning as Jesse, a young model who just moved to Los Angeles and quickly gets taken under the wing of makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone). As Jesse becomes more successful as a model, she meets various members of the industry who are willing to part the seas for her even as she makes enemies who get caught up in a wake she unknowingly creates. Even when people are being nice to her, no one lets Jesse pass without making it clear they\u2019re jealous of her beauty and curious about what she can give them\u2026 or that they can take from her.\n\nHere, like in Drive, Refn\u2019s version of LA is soaked in dread and seediness in every corner. Every person reads like a threat, and every new competitor or friend seems to be looking for a new way to drain the life out of the people around them \u2014 until they finally actually do it. But, like all Refn projects, what really sets The Neon Demon apart is how it looks. The griminess of the movie\u2019s world turns brightly lit photo shoots into shadow-filled nightmares, with people who stalk the sets like jungle predators.\n\nThough The Neon Demon didn\u2019t get the same acclaim as other so-called elevated horror movies from the time, looking back, it fits perfectly among the ranks of The Witch, It Follows, and Under the Skin. Refn\u2019s nightmarish modeling movie is dripping with cynicism, cruelty, and a creeping atmosphere, with more meanness than almost any other movie from the era could muster. But it\u2019s all in the pursuit of beauty, of course. \u2014AG\n\nOct. 16: Project Wolf Hunting\n\nWhere to watch: Hi-Yah!; available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\n\nSometimes, what you\u2019re looking for is just literal tons of blood and gore. And when that\u2019s contained in a premise that\u2019s essentially \u201cCon Air meets Predator, with a bit of The Last Voyage of the Demeter,\u201d that\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nProject Wolf Hunting is a Korean monster mash built out of an extremely fun idea. \u201cWhat if a bunch of dangerous criminals rebelled on the cargo ship they were being transported on, only to discover the ship is also transporting a monster?\u201d\n\nThe story is necessarily light, and the characters are thinly drawn (although the effective costuming and makeup work go a long way), but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for if you\u2019re watching Project Wolf Hunting. You\u2019re here for gory violence, and boy, is there a lot of it. The director has bragged that the team used 2.5 tons of fake blood while filming the movie, and it certainly shows. It\u2019s one of the goriest movies I\u2019ve ever seen, and that gore is augmented by terrific sound design, which builds the monster up into something well beyond the realm of humankind by making its movements sound metallic. It\u2019s a machine designed for killing, and Project Wolf Hunting is a movie designed for a bloody good time. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 17: Kuroneko\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel, Max\n\nLike his 1964 film Onibaba (which we featured in our 2021 Halloween countdown), Kaneto Shindo\u2019s 1968 supernatural horror film is a cerebral, gorgeous, and eerie drama set amid the tumultuous Sengoku period of Japanese history.\n\nKuroneko centers on the story of two women, a mother and her daughter-in-law, who are raped and murdered by a wandering band of samurai who set fire to their family home. Haunted by vengeance, their spirits forge a pact with the demons of the underworld, resurrecting them in exchange for the death of any samurai unfortunate enough to cross their paths. As the death toll rises, a young samurai is enlisted to fend off the wayward spirits once and for all, unaware of either the origins behind their malice or their tragic connection to his own past.\n\nKiyomi Kuroda\u2019s cinematography in Kuroneko is a master class in minimalism, employing an intense contrast of light and shadow to produce sequences that feel downright otherworldly to behold. Whether it\u2019s scenes of samurai wandering through a void of darkness by the Raj\u014dmon gates or a dreamlike pan through a bamboo thicket overlaid as a character ruminates over the past, the film is a gorgeous display of deft cinematic craftsmanship in service of telling a dramatic and terrifying story of love, revenge, and regret. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 18: A Wounded Fawn\n\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus\n\nOne of 2022\u2019s best under-the-radar horror movies takes its inspiration from an old-fashioned source: Greek mythology.\n\nDirector Travis Stevens (Jakob\u2019s Wife) melds Greek mythic imagery with an unconventional serial killer narrative in a thrilling combination that breathes new life into the genre. The movie follows a museum curator who goes on a date with a serial killer. She finds him out once she notices a statue, The Wrath of Erinyes, that is in his home but shouldn\u2019t be. From there, things get really strange.\n\nShot on 35mm, A Wounded Fawn is a gorgeous movie to behold, even before the action truly starts. Once it does, be prepared for a descent into the phantasmagoric, with jaw-dropping visuals, eerie practical effects, and a heavy dose of Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides.\n\nWith fantastic performances from Sarah Lind (Jakob\u2019s Wife) and Dropout veteran Josh Ruben (Werewolves Within) in an unsettlingly off-type role, A Wounded Fawn is a bold new entry into the serial killer movie canon. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 19: The Hole in the Ground\n\nWhere to watch: Max\n\nFew horror tropes get as much mileage as the image of the unnatural child. Likely that\u2019s because the idea that kids should be innocent and cheerful is baked into so many human cultures that a child acting spooky and inhuman is a terrific cross-cultural recipe for horror. But an effective creepy-kid movie requires a spectacular creepy kid performer. James Quinn Markey fully delivers in The Hole in the Ground, the debut feature of Evil Dead Rise director Lee Cronin. But the movie isn\u2019t just about a scary child \u2014 it\u2019s about all the psychological baggage involved in dealing with one.\n\nSe\u00e1na Kerslake stars as Sarah, a woman recently moved to the Irish countryside with her young son, Chris (Markey). After an unnerving incident, she starts to believe Chris has been replaced by an inhuman doppelg\u00e4nger. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that it\u2019s true, at least for the audience. But an erratic, violent local woman who also believes her son was replaced serves as a warning for Sarah, both about how she can expect the community to dismiss her anxieties, and more potently, as a dark mirror of her fears, a suggestion that she might just be losing her mind. This incredibly dark and squirmy movie is much quieter and more internal than Evil Dead Rise, but it sure puts the screws to the audience, especially as it builds to an unforgettable, horrifying climax. \u2014TR\n\nOct. 20: Silent Hill\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock\n\nThe mid-2000s were a no man\u2019s land for horror movies. By 2006, we were four years out from the blockbuster prestige of Gore Verbinski\u2019s The Ring and the J-horror import boom that followed it in America, and only just beginning to transition into the Saw-dominated years of \u201crealistic\u201d horror. More importantly, we were still almost a decade away from the arthouse horror boom that would kick off closer to 2014 with films like It Follows. This was exactly the environment Silent Hill was released into, and it deserved so much better.\n\nThe movie follows Rose, whose daughter, Sharon, is plagued with awful episodes of sleepwalking and nightmares about the mysterious abandoned town of Silent Hill. Rose brings Sharon to the town in a last-ditch attempt to find answers, but things go horribly wrong when the fog-shrouded town seems to transport them (along with police officer Cybil Bennett) to a new monstrous dimension. Meanwhile, after the mother and daughter have been gone for a few hours, Rose\u2019s husband, Christopher, sets off to Silent Hill to find his family.\n\nInside the town is where Silent Hill takes the most inspiration from the video game series it\u2019s based on. Some of Silent Hill\u2019s most recognizable enemies and monsters show up, chasing Cybil, Sharon, and Rose through the town and eventually into the iconic Pyramid Head. These segments are impressively scary, and steeped in the dreadful atmosphere that made the games famous.\n\nBut even beyond the terrifying town itself, the best part of Silent Hill comes when Christopher arrives. Rather than managing to find his family, all he finds is an abandoned mining town. For most of the movie, the women\u2019s frantic running and hiding from monsters is paralleled by Christopher wandering around the exact same areas, filled with a dreadful sense that his family is close, but completely unable to see them or the horrors threatening to kill them. It\u2019s not a subtle metaphor for the differences in the ways that men and women go through the world, but it is an effective one, and it manages to create a level of crushing existential terror and defeat that few movies ever come close to. \u2014AG\n\nOct. 21: Suspiria (2018)\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Freevee\n\nDario Argento\u2019s 1977 Suspiria is a horror masterpiece, the sort of film even the best directors would face insurmountable odds of matching with a remake. The story \u2014 an American ballerina who moves to Germany to attend a prestigious ballet company, only to be greeted by a series of murders and a supernatural mystery \u2014 is a vessel for Argento\u2019s craft, featuring some of his boldest visuals and some truly nauseating body horror.\n\nSo how, then, did Luca Guadagnino do the impossible, creating its contemporary equal?\n\nHe cast Tilda Swinton in multiple roles and Mia Goth to do the Mia Goth thing. For cinematography, he brought on Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, known for Guadagnino\u2019s own Call Me By Your Name, but also Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s seminal indie films Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives and Memoria. And for the score: Thom Yorke. Yes, Radiohead Thom Yorke.\n\nWhere other directors would have obsessively recreated a source text, rebooting it into something unrecognizable, Guadagnino\u2019s film is an homage \u2014 the sort of movie you imagine Argento would make with the budgets and creative freedom afforded by tech companies trying to buy cultural capital. It\u2019s more political. More grotesque. The ending is just more.\n\nThe truth is 2018\u2019s Suspiria and the original Suspiria should be enjoyed together. In the past, that\u2019s been a challenge, with the original film being surprisingly difficult to watch \u2014 especially if you prefer streaming. But this month, Criterion Collection has you covered, allowing for one of the most batshit double features of your life. \u2014CP\n\nOct. 22: Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\n\nWhere to watch: Available to purchase on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\n\nNot just a great horror movie, but one of the Great Movies, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth is among the best examples of a fairy tale for adults. Set during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth follows Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) after her pregnant mother takes her to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi L\u00f3pez) \u2014 a fascist Falangista hunting down the republican rebels that are hiding out in the Spanish forest.\n\nIn this terrifying time, Ofelia encounters a faun, a mythical creature that claims she is the reincarnated Princess Moanna, daughter of the king of the underworld. The Faun (Doug Jones) tells her that if she completes three tasks, she can return to the king and queen and live forever as princess of the underworld.\n\nLike many folk tales before they\u2019re sterilized by pop culture, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth is a fairy tale full of menace, danger, and horror \u2014 but also hope. It is both a refuge from a turbulent time and an attempt to understand it, a parable that becomes timeless in its specificity with new meaning to discover every time it\u2019s revisited. Widely considered to be writer-director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s magnum opus, it shows the director operating at the peak of his powers, with lavish production design, evocative colors, and naturalistic performances juxtaposed with quiet, dangerous magic.\n\nBut what makes it a great film is astonishingly simple. Some movies endeavor to make sure you understand them. The best ones help you understand yourself. Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, in the end, wants to know what kind of person you are by the time the credits roll. \u2014Joshua Rivera\n\nOct. 23: Eyes Without a Face\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel, Max\n\nThe late 1950s weren\u2019t exactly a booming era for French horror films. While Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s psychological thriller Diabolique received an effusive reception upon its release in 1955, the prevailing attitude of French critics at the time was that horror was antithetical to the high-minded standard of what French cinema should aspire to. Eyes Without a Face bucked against this perception, taking what would otherwise be a standard mad scientist tale and turning it into a dark horror fable about love, guilt, and madness.\n\nThe film follows Dr. G\u00e9nessier, a renowned plastic surgeon wracked with guilt over a car accident that disfigured his beloved daughter Christiane\u2019s face. Faking her death and confining her to the grounds of his mansion, G\u00e9nessier devises a desperate and horrifying scheme: Perform a series of skin grafts to repair Christiane\u2019s face using the faces of abducted women who resemble her. With the failure of each attempt, the body count begins to rise, prompting the authorities to mount a desperate manhunt to apprehend the culprit. In the midst of all of this, Christiane herself grows tired of her father\u2019s obsession, wishing instead to reunite with her lover Jacques and resume her life.\n\nFantastical and atmospheric, Eyes Without a Face is a beautiful horror thriller with masterful cinematography courtesy of Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan (who previously worked on Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis) and a memorable score composed by Maurice-Alexis Jarre, who would later go on to win an Academy Award for his work on Lawrence of Arabia. If you\u2019re looking for an intelligent and gorgeous horror movie that still manages to dabble in its share of gore, Georges Franju\u2019s masterpiece is a must-watch. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 24: Overlord\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount Plus, Pluto TV\n\nThis slept-on genre-mashing gem takes a cast of excellent actors about to do bigger things (Jovan Adepo, Wyatt Russell, John Magaro, Pilou Asb\u00e6k, and more), and an up-and-coming director (The Pope\u2019s Exorcist\u2019s Julius Avery) and places them behind Nazi lines during World War II. The Nazis are up to more than usual this time: There be zombies in these labs.\n\nOn the eve of D-Day, a group of Allied paratroopers are sent into Germany on a covert mission. Things go wrong instantly when their plane crashes, and they soon discover twisted Nazi experiments after connecting with the residents. Things get bloody fast, with great action from second unit director Shaun O\u2019Dell (The Woman King, Brotherhood of the Wolf) and stunt coordinator Jo McLaren (Heart of Stone).\n\nOverlord is a gleeful, intentionally ridiculous Nazi-zombie-bashing time, with tight direction and a fantastic group of actors. If you love the Wolfenstein games or Call of Duty\u2019s Zombies mode, or B-movies with A-movie production, this one is for you. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 25: Curve\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube\n\nTim Egan\u2019s 2016 horror short inspires the same visceral physical response as watching an episode of Squid Game. A young woman wakes to discover her twisted body perched precariously on the slope of a strange cliff overlooking a bottomless pit. Her hands caked with blood, the woman attempts to inch herself away from the pit, each desperate motion teetering on the cusp of survival and oblivion. Will she be able to escape where so many others have failed?\n\nCurve works as a horror short because it leaves so much to the imagination. We don\u2019t know who this woman is, how she ended up in this situation, or what the purpose of this place even is. In the presence of imminent horror, our first instinct is to scramble for answers and, in the absence of any to be found, our second instinct is to search for a means of escape. Through a captivating lead performance and deft sound design, Egan delivers a gripping horror story in just under 10 minutes. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 26: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\n\nWhere to watch: Max\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a nauseating smoothie of rural horror, outr\u00e9 indie experimentation, and wannabe snuff film. Its murders aren\u2019t real, but you\u2019d be forgiven for being convinced the film\u2019s actors are in genuine trouble; from the budget film stock to the filthy sets, it all feels\u2026 off. The result is not just a great horror flick, but a monumental work that originated many tropes of its genre and, most recently, earned a coveted spot in the Sight and Sound list of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is nothing like that. You won\u2019t see its name in a film school syllabus, and the films it inspired can be counted on one hand. Nonetheless, there\u2019s something commendable about the gall of Tobe Hooper, the original Texas Chain Saw director, returning to his series with the energy of a middle-aged man on his first ayahuasca retreat.\n\nLeatherface gets in a high-speed car battle, eventually standing on the roof of a speeding sedan. Dennis Hopper dual-wields chainsaws. A radio station office is obliterated like it\u2019s a novelty rage room. Sometimes you want a steak, and sometimes you want a hamburger. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a damn juicy burger. \u2014CP\n\nOct. 27: Possessor\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nMy first Brandon Cronenberg (yes, David\u2019s son) movie was Infinity Pool, his latest messed-up meditation on the rich and powerful. I vividly remember telling friends how exciting and debauched the movie was, and their response surprised me: \u201cClearly you haven\u2019t seen Possessor.\u201d\n\nThat night, I rectified this, and dear readers: They were right. As disturbing and mystifying as I found the world of Infinity Pool, Possessor was all that and more. And I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my brain since. Which is\u2026 fitting, considering the movie.\n\nAndrea Riseborough (Mandy, To Leslie) plays an elite corporate assassin who is able to inhabit other people\u2019s bodies, getting closer to her victims by posing as people already in their lives. It\u2019s a haunting premise, and one Possessor takes full advantage of, both in the moments of action and in the assassin\u2019s contemplation about what her identity truly even is.\n\nPossessor is an unforgettable entry into the psychological horror canon, and it brings a little sci-fi into your Halloween celebrations. Don\u2019t miss it. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 28: Opera\n\nWhere to watch: Shudder, Tubi, Vudu\n\nYou can\u2019t get more than five minutes into a conversation about Italian horror without mentioning Dario Argento, the giallo master.\n\nOpera represents the last hurrah of Argento\u2019s hot streak throughout the \u201970s and \u201980s. It\u2019s an extravagant horror-thriller that combines high-minded aesthetics with the viscerality of slasher cinema. The film follows Betty, the understudy to a famous opera singer, who is selected to play the role of Lady Macbeth after the star suffers a terrible accident. While preparing for her first big performance, Betty is subjected to a terrifying ordeal when she is attacked by a mysterious unseen assailant who tapes needles under her eyes and forces her to watch as her boyfriend is mutilated. Barely escaping with her life, Betty seeks the aid of Marco, the play\u2019s director, in apprehending the culprit before they can claim another victim.\n\nVery loosely based on Argento\u2019s own experience directing a failed production of Verdi\u2019s Macbeth, Opera is a sumptuous and suspenseful slasher that holds the viewer\u2019s attention and absolutely refuses to let go. Like Betty, one feels compelled to watch this macabre display of ritualistic horror play out to its conclusion in a desperate search of answers. Fortunately, unlike Betty, you won\u2019t have to worry about losing your eyes if you find yourself overwhelmed by the frights. \u2014TE\n\nOct. 29: House of 1000 Corpses\n\nWhere to watch: AMC Plus, Pluto TV, Tubi\n\nHouse of 1000 Corpses may be the true answer to the question \u201cWhat is the best The Texas Chain Saw Massacre sequel?\u201d\n\nThe movie follows a group of teens who are putting together a book on roadside attractions when they stumble upon a serial killer-themed rest stop run by a weirdo. After their strange encounter, the kids set off on the road, only for their car to break down a few miles later. Thankfully, their helpful hitchhiker companion Baby knows just the place they can get help: the Firefly mansion, where her family lives. From there, things devolve into a host of horrific stage plays, cursed experiments, and gruesome murders.\n\nThe family at its center, whom Rob Zombie went on to make two more movies about, is repulsive and absolutely horrible, but still zany enough to be truly unsettling in a way that few horror movies can be. House of 1000 Corpses is a grisly, grotesque film that captures all the grime of the \u201970s movies that inspired it. But what really makes it worth watching is the way it balances silliness and terror, doling each out in proportional quantities until you can\u2019t figure out if you should laugh or scream. Instead, you just end up doing both. \u2014AG\n\nOct. 30: Thirst\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock\n\nPark Chan-wook has never missed. And Thirst, his most overt foray into horror, may also be his steamiest movie (a high bar, considering the excellent The Handmaiden).\n\nFrequent Park collaborator Song Kang-ho stars as a Catholic priest who volunteers for a medical experiment. The experiment instead turns him into a vampire, giving him a lust for blood\u2026 and also for the wife of an old friend.\n\nIn many ways, this movie is in close relationship to his two most recent releases \u2014 The Handmaiden and Decision to Leave. It pairs the eroticism of the former with the charged relationship dynamic of the latter, to gripping effect. With Park\u2019s typical attention to detail and eye for arresting images (as well as his wicked sense of humor), Thirst is an unconventional and sexy Halloween watch. \u2014PV\n\nOct. 31: The Exorcist III\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Criterion Channel\n\nNearly 50 years since it was first released in theaters, William Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist has withstood the test of time as one of the most terrifying and influential horror films in American cinema. The sequel that came closest to capturing that same lightning in a bottle is The Exorcist III, written and directed by William Peter Blatty, the original screenwriter of the first film and author of the novel on which it was based.\n\nWhen a series of gruesome murders matching the modus operandi of an infamous serial killer begins to terrorize the city of Georgetown, Lt. William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) investigates the psych ward of a local hospital in search of leads. Confronted with a suspect whose appearance matches that of his late friend Father Damien Karras, Kinderman finds himself thrust into a battle for his very soul as he confronts an evil beyond his comprehension.\n\nThe story of The Exorcist III\u2019s production is a tangled mess of false starts, studio interference, and thwarted artistic ambitions. Though it was originally conceived with Friedkin in mind to return as director, he eventually left the project due to creative differences with Blatty. John Carpenter was at one time tapped to direct, before he too stepped aside to allow Blatty himself to take the reins. Morgan Creek Productions, which financed the film, demanded Blatty reshoot the film\u2019s final act, which originally ended without an exorcism. Even given these complications, The Exorcist III remains a fascinating and terrifying film in its own right, with a hodgepodge of fascinating creative choices and literary dialogue that makes the film feel like a sister piece to Blatty\u2019s The Ninth Configuration. It may not have been the Exorcist sequel that audiences at the time wanted, but it\u2019s still a damn fine picture. \u2014TE"

    "body": "Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s move to Monaco in 2020 may have been bad news for the British taxpayer, but not for Manchester United fans.\n\nThe chemical billionaire looks set to buy a 25 per cent stake in the Premier League giants after fellow bidder, Sheikh Jassim, withdrew his offer.\n\n6 Ratcliffe could still have a big say at United Credit: getty\n\n6 His wisest move could be to land his old neighbour Mitchell\n\nThat news hasn\u2019t been too warmly welcomed by United supporters, who would still have to put up with the hugely unpopular Glazer family in control of the club.\n\nIt could, though, mean some sort of progress, if the Manchester born Ratcliffe follows through with his vision to revolutionise the club.\n\nShould Ratcliffe come in, talkSPORT understands that he would take charge of footballing matters, something the Glazers have been accused of having little to no interest in.\n\nAlready a top tier European owner of OGC Nice, there has been some success, but nothing compared to their French riviera neighbours, where Ratcliffe appears set to look for inspiration.\n\nPaul Mitchell recently left the principality of Monaco, but he could well be back there in meetings with Ratcliffe who is planning to appoint a sporting director.\n\nMitchell fulfilled that role at Monaco after previous stints at Leipzig, Tottenham, Southampton and MK Dons, becoming one of football\u2019s most respected executives.\n\nA former player in England\u2019s lower leagues, Mitchell was previously linked with Chelsea and Liverpool, and much like Ratcliffe, he\u2019s also from Greater Manchester.\n\nStarring mainly for Wigan and MK Dons, it was with the latter where Mitchell was moved upstairs, and made his first big move by spotting future England regular Dele Alli after being named their head of recruitment in 2010.\n\nTwo years later he joined Southampton in the same role, and that\u2019s where he really began to show off, landing the Saints a number of players who would not only go on to become Champions League regulars, but make the club a fortune and ensure a Premier League best finish.\n\nShowcasing his skills in casting his scouting net far and wide, Sadio Mane, Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Dejan Lovren and Victor Wanyama all went on to secure Southampton a bright future, and Mitchell a promotion to Tottenham in 2014.\n\n6 Mane was one of Mitchell's early successes\n\n6 But there's been many more Credit: Getty\n\nThe north London side had just unsuccessfully splurged their world record \u00a385million from Real Madrid for Gareth Bale, and it looked like Mitchell couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time.\n\nHowever, names such as Alli, Heung-Min Son, Toby Alderweireld, Eric Dier and Kieran Trippier set the side up for a bright future, before chairman Daniel Levy got in Mitchell\u2019s way.\n\nLeaving what he called his \u2018dream job\u2019 after less than two years, it was reportedly due to Levy\u2019s over-involvement in negotiations and the recruitment process, something which wasn\u2019t an issue at his next club \u2013 Leipzig.\n\nRalf Rangnick landed Mitchell and more success followed. Signings such as Dani Olmo, Christopher Nkunku and Amadou Haidara again showcased what Mitchell can do with the shackles off, and again the results followed.\n\n6 Getting Nkunku from PSG was one of Mitchell's biggest coups Credit: Getty\n\nMany of his signings starred in a run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2020, and in 2022 won the club\u2019s first ever trophy with a DFB Pokal.\n\nOnly leaving the side to reach the pinnacle of his job, finally stepping up from a head of recruitment to become sporting director at Monaco, Mitchell showed just how big picture he is with an interview in 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to continue to drive standards in each and every department,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychology, sports science, nutrition, medicine, the way we travel, the way we refuel.\n\n\u201cEverything, every element I think we need to keep pushing to its maximum to try and be the best we possibly can.\u201d\n\nHaving worked in football management for over a decade, Mitchell\u2019s career has always been about the long term for his club\u2019s, with the young signings he\u2019s made often only paying off after he\u2019s left.\n\nOne in particular was 2022/23 Premier League top scorer Son, who perfectly sums up his philosophy.\n\n\u201cI took quite a lot of criticism in my first year at Tottenham for some of the decisions and Sonny was kind of at the centre of that,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cSometimes players need time, they\u2019re human beings, they need to settle, Sonny had a great track record at Hamburg and Leverkusen but there was this narrative that started to grow internally and externally that he wasn\u2019t a good finisher.\n\n6 Mitchell is becoming an increasingly recognisable face\n\n\u201cI remember telling a coach \u2018you\u2019re wrong, his history shows in two different clubs he\u2019s a very astute finisher off both sides\u2019.\u201d\n\nMitchell remains good friends with Rangnick from their time together at Leipzig, and last season made headlines when he was spotted at a youth team game while the German was interim coach at Man United.\n\nSo astute is Mitchell in his observations, he even laid out a blueprint for United's success while at Monaco.\n\n\u201cI think context is important to measure what Manchester United's current situation is, but I think they do need to get to the point of really putting down what Manchester United needs to be in the modern game,\u201d he explained.\n\n\"We are a long time from the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Erik ten Hag is a top coach from Ajax but they need a top blueprint not only for now but for the next five years, and work towards that, and sometimes on that journey there are hard moments when you don't get the right results, even though you're doing the right things.\n\n\"You have to know that, over that period, the consistency of the decision-making will yield a good end result. I think we've seen that both Manchester City and Liverpool, that when you adopt that long-term strategy you can get real consistency and sustainable success.\n\n\"I think that's the biggest thing for Manchester United; putting down their identity of what they want to be today, but most crucially what they want to be in five years' time, and where they want to be, and what they want to look like; from everything from young players, to the style of play, to the whole culture peace in Manchester United.\"\n\nAlmost certain to consult Rangnick before any approach from Ratcliffe, Mitchell may be warned off of a club where long-term thinking hasn\u2019t existed.\n\nBut, should Ratcliffe get his man, it could signal exactly the change in fortunes he and every supporter has been hoping for at Manchester United."

    "body": "The 2019 Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa was one of many firsts: the game itself capped off a sensational tournament played outside of the sport's traditional strongholds for the first time; it was the first final in which South Africa scored a try, and by full-time, the 32-12 score in the Springboks' favour sealed a record-equalling third title for the Rainbow Nation.\n\nFast forward four years, and South Africa once again prepare to take on England in an all-or-nothing match to decide which nation gets a shot at World Cup glory \u2014 but this time around, the pair meet in the semi-finals of the 2023 tournament, rather than the decider.\n\nThat won't make an ounce of difference for either camp, though, as these two long-time rivals prepare for a battle that could re-define the definition of a 'physical encounter.'\n\nThe #Springboks are gearing up for another tough challenge this week with a semi-final clash against England \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f#StrongerTogether #RWC2023 pic.twitter.com/HLSnnjWggB \u2014 Springboks (@Springboks) October 18, 2023\n\nEngland are the only side still competing who are yet to lose a game, and that will stand them in good stead coming into this semi-final. Dominant wins over Argentina, Japan and Chile sealed passage to the last eight, and after being given an almighty scare by Samoa in their final pool match, England overcame a Fijian fightback in Marseille to triumph 30-24. Despite being outscored by three tries to two, captain Owen Farrell kicked 20 points, sending his side into the last four at the expense of 2023's breakout stars.\n\nThe Springboks have done it tough, too, having already faced two of the tournament favourites on their way to the semi-finals. Comfortable defeats of Scotland, Romania and Tonga couldn't mask the disappointment of the 13-8 loss to Ireland, which consigned South Africa to second in Pool B. However, with Ireland sent home by the All Blacks in the quarters, the Bokke showed their World Cup mettle to edge the hosts 29-28 at the Stade de France, sneaking past Les Bleus in one of the best games of rugby you're ever likely to see.\n\nThe last time Cheslin Kolbe played England at a Rugby World Cup... \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udfc6#RWC2023 | #ENGvRSA pic.twitter.com/Riw2uaSaKa \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 19, 2023\n\nBoth sides' journeys have seen twists, turns, and bumps in the road, but it's led them both to within 80 minutes of a Rugby World Cup final. England will no doubt be looking to echo the spirit of 2019, when they beat the All Blacks 19-7 to reach the final, but in South Africa, they face a side who have taken their game to new heights just to reach the semis.\n\nMORE: 2023 Rugby World Cup final: Details, kick-off time and every team's route\n\nWhat time does England vs South Africa kick off?\n\nEngland and South Africa face off in the 2023 Rugby World Cup's second semi-final, played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France.

The high-ball security and hulking frame of Freddie Steward returns to the No. 15 jersey in one of three changes, while at inside centre, Manu Tuilagi starts hoping to repeat his heroics of four years ago, when his early try in a dominant semi-final performance took England past the All Blacks.\n\nEngland's other two changes come in the tight five, with Steve Borthwick making some big calls ahead of this game. Joe Marler starts ahead of vice-captain Ellis Genge at loosehead prop, and Ollie Chessum is replaced in the second-row by George Martin. The latter is winning only his seventh England cap but gets the starting nod alongside Maro Itoje, with Genge, Chessum and the rest of the replacements hoping to make an impact sizeable enough to overcome the Springboks' infamous 'bomb squad'.\n\nTheir time is now \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\nHere is the @EnglandRugby team to take on reigning champions South Africa in the semi-final in Paris#RWC2023 | #ENGvRSA pic.twitter.com/nkf6rXBPUU \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 19, 2023\n\nEngland starting XV: Freddie Steward, Jonny May, Joe Marchant, Manu Tuilagi, Elliot Daly, Owen Farrell, Alex Mitchell; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Dan Cole, Maro Itoje, George Martin, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Ben Earl.\n\nEngland replacements: Theo Dan, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Ollie Chessum, Billy Vunipola, Danny Care, George Ford, Ollie Lawrence.\n\nThe Springboks are unchanged from that epic quarter-final with France, having all played their part as Jacques Nienaber's side hung on in the second half. The contribution of backs Kurt-Lee Arendse, Damian de Allende and Cheslin Kolbe saw all three cross for first-half tries, with Kolbe's coming off the back of a charged-down conversion from France's Thomas Ramos. Preventing those two points proved crucial in the end.\n\nThe key contribution, though, came from Eben Etzebeth, who bulldozed his way over to score the only five-pointer of the second half and wrestle the game back into South African hands. He and Franco Mostert pack down together in the second row, while hooker Bongi Mbonambi, utility Deon Fourie, veteran Duane Vermeulen and the devilish Kwagga Smith will all be looking to back up superb quarter-final performances to take the Springboks to a second consecutive World Cup final.\n\nSouth Africa starting XV: Damian Willemse, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe, Manie Libbok, Cobus Reinach; Steven Kitshoff, Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Franco Mostert, Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Duane Vermeulen.\n\nSouth Africa replacements: Deon Fourie, Ox Nche, Vincent Koch, RG Snyman, Kwagga Smith, Faf de Klerk, Handre Pollard, Willie le Roux.\n\nEngland vs. South Africa betting odds, prediction\n\nThe last time these two sides met was a tumultuous period to say the least, particularly for English rugby. South Africa's dominant 27-13 victory at Twickenham proved to be the last game in charge for Eddie Jones, the coach who had taken England to the 2019 World Cup final. In his place, Steve Borthwick was hired, and he's just one game away from repeating that feat.\n\nEngland's form at this tournament has been perfect \u2014 at face value. Argentina, Japan, Chile, Samoa and Fiji have all provided highlights \u2014 Los Pumas are also in the semi-finals \u2014 and England have beaten all of them. However, only Japan and Chile were defeated with bonus points, and the narrow wins over both Samoa and Fiji in their last two games showed that England are certainly gettable.\n\nIn short, this semi-final requires a huge step up in quality for Borthwick's side, and that's why we think that the Springboks will be victorious at the Stade de France. South Africa have already shown they can match, and beat, the world's best, and we think that they'll do the latter in Saint-Denis."

    "body": "The first thing to know about the Steam Deck OLED is that it\u2019s not the Steam Deck 2. The Steam Deck OLED is a mid-cycle refresh from Valve, similar to the Switch OLED upgrade, but there\u2019s a lot more going on internally here. Its screen is better, its battery life is better, its thumbsticks are better, the haptics are better, and its chip and thermals are better. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is its form factor \u2014 this is still one of the biggest babies on the handheld block.\n\nThe new Steam Deck\u2019s main upgrade is its OLED screen, which replaces the original LCD and, crucially, has native support for HDR and faster frame rates. The OLED also has smaller bezels, making the display larger at 7.4 inches, compared with the original 7-inch screen.\n\nValve Valve Steam Deck OLED SCORE 89 Engadget 89 Critics - Not yet scored N/A Users - Not yet scored N/A Pros Improved battery life\n\nBright and smooth visuals\n\nBetter thermals\n\nFeels less top-heavy\n\nLong charging cable Cons Still ridiculously large\n\nSeriously it\u2019s so big\n\nValve Valve Steam Deck OLED This isn't the Steam Deck 2 some are waiting for, it's just a welcome improvement on an already good device. $549 at Steam\n\nOLED screen\n\nThe HDR OLED display looks fantastic. It features a wider P3 color gamut, pure blacks and a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, compared with the original max of 400 nits. In action, this means the screen\u2019s bezels meld with the black of any game, creating a more polished frame for retro aspect ratios and providing room for higher-contrast colors. The screen on the new model doesn\u2019t support variable refresh rates (VRR), but it now tops out at 90Hz, while the original could only hit 60Hz. The updated display is smooth, crisp and bright, like a perfect lemon tart. (Even then, I do not recommend licking the screen.)\n\nBattery life\n\nOne of the downsides of the first Steam Deck was its short battery life, which maxed out at eight hours, and that was only under ideal conditions. Valve says the new Steam Deck battery will last 30 to 50 percent longer, depending on how you\u2019re playing, and it charges faster \u2014 the company claims it will go from 20 percent to 80 percent in 45 minutes.\n\nCustom AMD APU\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the custom AMD APU found in the original Steam Deck \u2014 same CPU and GPU, just more efficient. This is the process Sony takes advantage of to build the PS4 Slim and PS5 Slim, but instead of collapsing the Steam Deck around smaller hardware, Valve chose to add a bigger battery and larger fan to its existing chassis. For developers, this means the device has the same performance targets as the original and there\u2019s no need to create games specifically for the new hardware. In the end, the device weighs about 30 grams less than the original model, or the equivalent of five quarters.\n\nEngadget\n\nIn use\n\nWhich leads us to the bad news for my tiny hand gang. The Steam Deck OLED is the same monstrous size as the original: 11.7 inches long, 4.5 inches tall and nearly 2 inches thick. The thumbsticks on the new model are actually 1mm taller than the first version. This was one of my main complaints about the Steam Deck when I first reviewed it: I have smaller-than-average hands, and the Steam Deck looks and feels absolutely ridiculous when I\u2019m holding it. It\u2019s just massive, no matter how long my manicure gets. However, the OLED model feels more balanced than the original. It\u2019s less top-heavy, and it does technically weigh less. These small adjustments have made a noticeable difference during my playtime, and the device feels slightly more manageable as a handheld \u2014 or maybe I\u2019m just too distracted by all of its bright, pretty colors to care about the cramping in my palms.\n\nThe thumbsticks on the new handheld have an improved texture that shouldn\u2019t turn gray after a few months\u2019 use, and they feel perfectly serviceable. In my hands-on time so far, I've found that the OLED touchscreen responds immediately to input, and the haptic feedback on the built-in trackpads feels even more precise, populating in reactive pin-pricks under the textured plastic.\n\nI spent a few cozy nights on my couch swapping between the LCD and OLED Steam Decks, and honestly, after I\u2019m done with this review, I\u2019ll probably retire my original model. The Steam Deck OLED is sharper and more responsive; indie games, AAA games and plain old Steam menus look so much better on the new hardware.\n\nEngadget\n\nHades is my most-played game on the original Steam Deck, so I used that to test out Valve\u2019s battery life claims. Though it doesn\u2019t support HDR, a game like Hades pops on the OLED, and its animations look more fluid than on the LCD version. The OLED lasted four hours and 23 minutes before dying. With the same settings (800p with a 60 fps cap and similar brightness) the original model died after two hours and 42 minutes. That\u2019s a 62 percent improvement, surpassing Valve\u2019s own estimates, though batteries degrade and I\u2019ve had my LCD Steam Deck since the device\u2019s launch in early 2022. In a stress test that involved playing Elden Ring with everything maxed out, the OLED battery lasted two hours and 20 minutes, about 40 percent longer than the original.\n\nPlaying the Steam Decks back-to-back highlighted another significant quality-of-life improvement: heat management. My palms have gotten toasty playing the OLED model, but they haven\u2019t broken a sweat like they often do with the original. The new fan may be larger, but it\u2019s not any louder, and it clearly works a treat.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a new Wi-Fi 6E module and improved antennas that should enable faster downloads for anyone with a compatible router. I don\u2019t have a 6E router or multi-gigabit Wi-Fi, but with a regular Wi-Fi 6 router, the top download speed I saw on the new Steam Deck was 562mbps, which was about 10 percent faster than the old Steam Deck, and 10 percent slower than the speeds I get on my MacBook Pro. The device uses Bluetooth 5.3 and adds a dedicated antenna, which should improve functionality when using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth at the same time.\n\nEngadget\n\nEven with improvements to the battery, thermals and weight distribution, the Steam Deck OLED is still more of a Wii U than a Vita. It\u2019s a beast of a handheld, and it makes the most sense as a portable console to use around the house, rather than a truly travel-ready device. The new model even comes with an extra-long, 2.5m charging cable, designed specifically with couch-based players in mind. I didn\u2019t test out the docking station with the new Steam Deck, but Valve recently released a SteamOS update that lets players take advantage of HDR and VRR on external displays, which only drives home the Wii U-ness of it all.\n\nAs far as software, you know the drill by now. Valve has rolled out labels for Steam games signifying how well they\u2019ll work on the handheld, with four levels: unknown, unsupported, playable and verified. Playable games generally come with a small caveat, like having to deploy the on-screen keyboard, while verified games have been fully optimized for portable play. Currently, more than 10,000 titles on Steam fall under the playable or verified labels, with more added every day.\n\nWhen will the Steam Deck OLED be available?\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED will go on sale on November 16th at 1pm ET, and Valve has units ready to ship that same day. The company has lowered the price of its LCD lineup and will sell through its backstock of 64GB and 512GB models until they\u2019re all gone. It\u2019ll continue selling the 256GB LCD model at a reduced price of $400, while the 512GB OLED model will cost $550 and the 1TB OLED model will cost $650. There\u2019s also a limited edition 1TB OLED version priced at $680 that comes with a special carrying case, a translucent gray body and orange accents.\n\nValve\n\nWrap-up\n\nAccording to the developers I spoke with at Valve, this is the definitive version of the Steam Deck. The HDR OLED model is what they would have released the first time around, if the technology had existed before 2022. The handheld market has evolved quickly \u2014 in just over a year, the Steam Deck proved there\u2019s widespread demand for handheld PCs, and its success helped drive chip makers and display manufacturers to build hardware specifically for high-fidelity mobile play. This is great news for Valve and the Steam Deck, and also the other handhelds coming out of companies like Ayaneo, ASUS, Ayn, Logitech, Retroid and Razer. Hell, maybe even Playdate will get an HDR OLED display one day. (Just kidding; Playdate is literally perfect).\n\nSo, no, the HDR OLED refresh isn't the Steam Deck 2, but it is a welcome improvement on an already good device. The Steam Deck OLED is the facetuned, photoshopped, spit-shined version of Valve\u2019s handheld, and it features tangible, clever improvements. The updated display is the highlight of the device, while things like faster charging, improved antennas and smoother haptics are welcome bonuses. More importantly, this is Valve renewing its commitment to portable PC gaming, and that\u2019s a relief to see. The Steam Deck is the granddaddy of handheld PCs and Valve has the resources to continue innovating in this space. For now, the OLED model is a half-step toward the Steam Deck 2, which may be the final version of the device \u2014 unless Valve finally learns how to count to three."

    "body": "Tim Sweeney finally has a win.\n\nOn Monday, a federal jury surprised the world by siding with Fortnite maker Epic Games in its fight to break Google\u2019s control over Android apps \u2014 even though \u201cwalled garden\u201d rival Apple almost entirely won a similar case two years ago. The nine-person jury decided that Google has an illegal monopoly over Android app distribution and in-app payment systems, and that Google illegally tied its Google Play billing system to its app store.\n\nSweeney is Epic\u2019s CEO, co-founder, and importantly its controlling shareholder. He\u2019s the one behind these lawsuits, and it was his idea to challenge these companies in court. It\u2019s been his fight from the very beginning, and he watched almost the entire trial in person from the best seat in the house \u2014 with a clear view of the jury, the judge, each witness, and the faces of Google\u2019s lawyers.\n\nLast night, I asked him why, what he learned, and what\u2019s next.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nThank you for being here with us. It\u2019s been a very engaging trial to watch. I\u2019ve been there every day of the trial, and you\u2019ve been there every day save one. So my first question is why did you personally attend this trial every day save one \u2014 and what the heck happened on that one day?\n\nYeah, Epic is asking a lot of the court system and the jury here, spending four weeks on a major antitrust trial full of complicated facts and evidence. It wouldn\u2019t be right to start something like this and not show up. So I had to do that. And, you know, Phil Schiller sat throughout the entire Epic v. Apple trial, as did I, so I think it\u2019s just necessary to show respect for the legal process.\n\nWhat happened on that one day you weren\u2019t here?\n\nOh \u2014 sorry I can\u2019t share, but there were some... non-Epic issues I had to deal with.\n\nSo this trial has been four years in the making. I look back at a September 2019 email that was in discovery about a plan to draw Google into a legal battle over antitrust. Can you describe what it felt like, after four years, to hear the jury find for Epic?\n\nWell, it\u2019s a great day for all developers to see that the Sherman Antitrust Act works in the new era of tech monopolies; we\u2019ve not had a major antitrust verdict against a tech company that meant change and benefits for everybody since the 1990s, with the US v. Microsoft. Back in the early days of the internet. So this is an awesome thing and it\u2019s much needed by the industry which is being strangled by a few gatekeepers imposing insane amounts of control and extracting huge taxes, which not only raise prices for consumers but also make a lot of kinds of products just unviable.\n\nI understand the significance, but... you were there in person. You had a smile on your face, you shook the Google attorney\u2019s hand, you clapped Bornstein on the back. How did you feel in that moment?\n\nWell, it was a great relief. The conventional wisdom that attorneys tell you is that when there\u2019s a rapid jury verdict, it\u2019s typically not good for the plaintiffs making a complicated case, and so there was some trepidation going on \u2014 but it was awesome to see.\n\nSomething that we\u2019d suspected all along was the jury was really following the case carefully. They weren\u2019t snoozing off as you might expect with the complexity of these documents and things \u2014 everybody was paying attention, they\u2019re looking at the question asker and the witness and taking notes and reading documents. It was just awesome to see that the justice system works, even with the most complex type of tech antitrust case that you can possibly throw at a jury.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Every journalist in the courtroom agreed the jury was attentive; most were also surprised by the rapid verdict.]\n\nThey got it, they got it quickly, and they were able to pull apart what was going on and contrast it with the fiction of the story that Google was trying to tell.\n\nWhat was something that surprised you in the courtroom, something you heard come to light that you hadn\u2019t heard before?\n\nI\u2019d suspected a lot of the practices that Google had, you know, since 2018 or so when we first started this, to such an extent that some folks would occasionally call me a conspiracy theorist. It was really, really interesting to see that my understandings of what Google was doing behind the scenes were actually true \u2014 you\u2019re leaking our conversations to reporters to get negative stories written about us; you\u2019re paying other developers off to convince them not to launch their own stores; they were going around and paying carriers and OEMs secretly not to carry competing stores.\n\nAnd when we tried to bundle Fortnite with other smartphone manufacturers like OnePlus and carriers of all sorts, they told us they couldn\u2019t do a deal because Google had done a secret deal with them.\n\nIt was really disconcerting to see the extent of bad faith efforts that were going on in a company of Google\u2019s size. You\u2019d think a trillion-dollar company would develop to the point where they have pretty respectable processes and leadership structures that provide a check and balance against wrongdoing, but they were rampantly destroying all their chats on these topics.\n\nYou\u2019d see long conversation threads would start to get into a spicy antitrust issue, and suddenly somebody points out the history\u2019s on and the chat goes silent. They just turned it off to have the documents destroyed. It was great to see that all called out in detail.\n\nAny particular evidence where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh wow, I never saw that, and now that specific thing came out for the world to see\u201d?\n\nAs an employee of Epic, I\u2019ve not been able to see Google\u2019s internal documents until the trial started. The lawyers can see them, but I saw almost all the key elements in this case at the same time the jury saw them. Two things stand out big time. Google\u2019s Project Hug was an astonishingly corrupt effort at a massive scale \u2014 the same corrupt deal structure they tried to do with Epic when they wanted to pay us off to launch Fortnite on Google Play and not launch our own store.\n\nAs soon as we thwarted their effort, they went around to 27 different developers and offered each one a payoff to undermine any effort we had to get their games onto our store exclusively. Activision and Riot and Supercell had direct distribution plans that they were planning on; Google paid them not to pursue those plans. Just direct blatant violations of anti-competition law, it\u2019s crazy a company of Google\u2019s scale would do that.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller developer than Spotify, you get screwed.\u201d\n\nThe other astonishing one was the Spotify deal. Spotify is the one company that had comparable negotiating power to Fortnite. Instead of using their power to fight for the good of all developers, they did a special deal with Google. Google gave them a 0 percent fee. Google let Spotify process their own payments, and Spotify kept 100 percent. They do it for Spotify and for nobody else. If you\u2019re a smaller developer than Spotify, you get screwed.\n\nWhen Spotify uses Google\u2019s own payment service, instead of paying the 30 percent that Google forces other developers to pay, they pay 4 percent. That\u2019s what the rate should be! Four percent is a perfectly reasonable rate for an unbundled payment system.\n\nIf instead of offering you a $147 million deal, Google said, \u201cYou can pay 0 percent to use your own payments system or 4 percent for Google Play billing,\u201d would you be here today? Would you have fought this lawsuit to begin with if they\u2019d simply offered something more fair to you?\n\nNo, we\u2019ve always turned down special deals just for Epic. We\u2019ve always fought on the principal that all developers should be, you know, given the same opportunities. One of the documents in evidence was a 2019 email I sent \u2014 right before Fortnite launched the Marvel season with all this amazing new content and the Star Wars event featuring J.J. Abrams. Right before that, I sent an email to all the Google senior executives saying that we wanted to bring Fortnite to the Google Play Store in time for that event, and we wanted them to allow us and all other developers to process certain payments and keep them all.\n\nThat was our proposal to Google in 2019. If Google had said yes to that, that would have been awesome for all developers \u2014 the Android ecosystem would have become much, much stronger, and Google would be in a much better position in the smartphone industry than they are today. We would\u2019ve never had a dispute because the problem would have been solved.\n\nIt\u2019s always been in Google\u2019s power to solve this problem. They make several billion dollars a year in unfairly earned profits from imposing this tax, which is nothing compared to the money they make from search. For all the other benefits they get from Android, Google could solve this problem today if they wanted to.\n\nDo you today believe that Activision Blizzard was really intending to build its own app store?\n\nI don\u2019t know about Supercell, but we know from the documents in the case that Riot was planning to distribute League of Legends directly through their website, on mobile, exactly as they do on PC. And that\u2019s what they planned to do until Google paid them off to not do that. Google\u2019s payoff at the minimum dissuaded Riot from distributing off Google Play.\n\nI think they\u2019re the strongest example of the three, but I\u2019m curious about Activision.\n\nActivision was building a store! We know they had a large team of dozens of engineers building a mobile app store to launch on Android.\n\nWe know that because they came to us and told us they were doing that. And we know it because after all that went down, I talked to an Activision employee who was close to that effort, working with the team building the store, and he reported that the entire store team Activision had employed to build their competing store had been disbanded as soon as Activision signed their deal with Google.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: We did not hear from such a person at trial; I\u2019d be eager to speak to them now!]\n\nWe know Activision was telling Google they were building their computing store; we know in Google internal discussions they said they didn\u2019t want Activision building a competing store. They agreed to sign this deal, and they were gleeful about the fact they dissuaded perhaps their number one competitor at the time from launching their own store.\n\nFour years later, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard \u2014 and one of the big talking points from Microsoft to the European Union was that the merger strengthened the company overall in order to provide a viable computing store on iOS and Android.\n\nWhat would you say the differences are between the Apple and Google cases?\n\nI would say Apple was ice and Google was fire.\n\nThe thing with Apple is all of their antitrust trickery is internal to the company. They use their store, their payments, they force developers to all have the same terms, they force OEMs and carriers to all have the same terms.\n\nWhereas Google, to achieve things with Android, they were going around and paying off game developers, dozens of game developers, to not compete. And they\u2019re paying off dozens of carriers and OEMs to not compete \u2014 and when all of these different companies do deals together, lots of people put things in writing, and it\u2019s right there for everybody to read and to see plainly.\n\nI think the Apple case would be no less interesting if we could see all of their internal thoughts and deliberations, but Apple was not putting it in writing, whereas Google was. You know, I think Apple is... it\u2019s a little bit unfortunate that in a lot of ways Apple\u2019s restrictions on competition are absolute. Thou shalt not have a competing store on iOS and thou shalt not use a competing payment method. And I think Apple should be receiving at least as harsh antitrust scrutiny as Google.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that because Google distributes the Android operating system as open source, they had to put all these deals out in the open. More out in the open, I should say \u2014 certainly they still wanted to keep them secret.\n\nBut I\u2019m going down my story about all the best emails from the Epic v. Apple trial \u2014 and we do have a lot of documents from both Apple and Google that show they were similarly self-serving in terms of deals.\n\nI\u2019d say this is the thing that\u2019s disappointed me the most with Apple and Google: even at the peak of the antitrust trial against Microsoft, Microsoft was awesome to developers. Microsoft has always been awesome to developers, always being respectful, giving developers a great deal and treating them as partners, you know? And so even as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent. [Editor\u2019s note: Netscape might feel differently.]\n\n\u201cEven as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Apple both treat developers as adversaries \u2014 they try to attack our revenue streams and prevent us from competing with their products. They\u2019ve built these massive self-preferencing schemes all around excluding developers and disadvantaging third-party developers. I think this is very shortsighted. I think any tech company \u2014 Apple, Google included \u2014 would be much better off in the long term if they viewed developers as awesome partners and did everything they could to support them and empower them and not get in their way financially.\n\nAnd this has been our philosophy with Unreal Engine, for example, and the Epic Games Store. We just want to be a cool partner that helps other companies succeed the way we do. And I think philosophy change... perhaps it will only come with a generational change in the company\u2019s management. I think the philosophy change would do both of those companies much good.\n\nIf you get your way in terms of being able to freely put your own store on Android, do you believe that would only be a game store or would it also be an app store? We look at Valve and we see a store that could be both, but they\u2019ve decided to focus exclusively on games.\n\nSo the Epic Games Store isn\u2019t a games store, right? It\u2019s the store operated by Epic Games. So we have a lot of non-games there already. We have the Brave web browser, we have a number of software creation tools including Unreal Engine, and there\u2019s more coming, including some other awesome creation tools and productivity tools. We\u2019ll host any app anybody wants of any sort.\n\nI think the gaming market is something we\u2019re uniquely close to, and so I think we would likely be able to forge closer partnerships and opportunities in gaming, but we\u2019ll be open to everybody on Android as we are on PC.\n\nWhat were your settlement talks with Google CEO Sundar Pichai like?\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about content, but we met for an hour and had a professional discussion... in which we didn\u2019t reach a settlement. We were rather far apart, let\u2019s say, because what Epic wants ultimately is free competition and fair competition for everybody, and the removal of the payments tie and removal of the anticompetitive measures, which obviously leads to far better deals for consumers and developers.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t want is a special deal just for ourselves, and Google\u2019s strategy so far as you\u2019ve seen from all these deals has been to basically take out all their potential competitors one at a time while they\u2019re still weak and small, before they build up or unite into a formidable force. Epic\u2019s not going to go along with something like that and do a special deal just for ourselves.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that a couple times, but the email that you accused Google of leaking suggested that Epic was interested in a special deal of some sort at that time. I don\u2019t know if that was on behalf of you and fellow developers. Can you tell us what that email was actually about?\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t leak the email; they leaked their ridiculously biased summary of it to Abner Li at 9to5Google. Don Harrison testified at trial that he didn\u2019t think Google leaked to the press. And then he was presented with a document including Google\u2019s press team and Sameer Samat, head of all Android, basically summarizing the articles that appeared as a result of Google\u2019s leaking of our plans to the press.\n\nSo I was wondering if you could tell me what the email actually said.\n\nOh, it\u2019s in evidence! This was the one I mentioned! Right before Christmas-ish 2019, we were planning to launch the new Marvel season with a bunch of Star Wars content and its awesome lineup. I asked Google\u2019s executives to let Fortnite come to the Google Play Store using our own payment method and to open up, you know, using their own payment methods to all developers, not just Epic. That was our proposal.\n\nOh, I think I read that one in court. I didn\u2019t realize that was the same thing. It\u2019s so far off from what I heard [about a \u201cspecial billing exception\u201d] that I didn\u2019t recognize it being that. Does winning the verdict in this Google case help your appeal with the Apple case in any way?\n\nThere\u2019s no linkage between the cases and law, so it would just come down to whether the court is in any way following current events on this topic. But there\u2019s no legal connection between the two. It really comes down to the decisions of the humans involved: the justices and the support teams involved when considering the appeal.\n\nGoogle will appeal this; they\u2019ve told us they\u2019re going to challenge the verdict. Will Epic rely on this ruling in the meantime?\n\nWe\u2019re not going to wait. We\u2019re going to do absolutely everything we can as quickly as we can to start changing the world. We not only have this verdict here in the United States, it is a worldwide verdict, right? We established a market worldwide, excluding China. So any remedies, we would presume, would be worldwide. We also have the European DMA; we have Epic v. Apple and Epic v. Google cases coming up in Australia, and another one in the UK.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Epic anymore, there\u2019s a lot of legislators, there\u2019s a lot of regulators, and there\u2019s other litigation all pushing in the direction of openness. And we\u2019re going to do absolutely everything we can.\n\nDo you have anything to say to your former partners in litigation, Match Group, that abandoned you at the last minute and may now be regretting it?\n\nOh, yeah, no. Match has been an awesome partner and a fellow member of the Coalition for App Fairness. I really hope that they got out of their settlement what they needed to get for their business. Very few companies have the resources that Epic has to fight multinational litigation against the world\u2019s two most powerful companies. So there are absolutely no hard feelings, and we\u2019re grateful that they joined the case because they did help in critical ways. Epic will continue to fight for all developers, seeking remedies, and... I don\u2019t know if Sundar is going to be calling me, but if he does, all of our discussions will be directed toward solving the problem for everyone.\n\nA lot has changed since you filed the original lawsuit over three years ago. For a bit there, it seemed like Epic had an interest in expanding outside of games with acquisitions like Houseparty and Bandcamp. What changed? And did app store restrictions play into that at all?\n\nLet\u2019s see. No... well, not directly, anyway. We have a really broad strategy of building games and technology. We\u2019ve had huge success in recent years with the Unreal Engine gaining adoption among all kinds of industries even beyond games. We\u2019ve also run into our own financial limitations. You know, we expanded the company to nine times the size we were before Fortnite took off. And so we\u2019re just trying to forge the strategy where we\u2019re living within our means and doing everything we absolutely can.\n\nBut we\u2019ve gotten so much traction with Fortnite in so many different ways, and with the Epic Games Store, right, we\u2019re going to continue investing heavily here. The Epic Games Store is the untold success story in the background. Since it launched in 2018, we now have 80 million monthly active users. Steam has 120 million, so we\u2019re catching them fast! Fortnite has more concurrent users right now than all Steam games combined. You should really expect dramatic changes that benefit all developers over the next few years.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Sweeney isn\u2019t right about Fortnite having more concurrent users than Steam. Epic spokesperson Natalie Mu\u00f1oz confirmed Sweeney misinterpreted a Polygon story about how Fortnite hit 7.6 million players at a time when the entirety of Steam had 10.1 million. These days, Steam generally peaks at over 30 million, with valleys of 20 million. Fortnite\u2019s valleys are closer to 3.8 million.]\n\nTim Sweeney says he plays Jellie in Fortnite. Image: Epic Games\n\nOkay, let\u2019s do a lightning round. What\u2019s your favorite Fortnite skin?\n\nI play as Jellie! Jellyfish. You know, the big tentacles? It\u2019s just so cool!\n\nWill Epic ever announce Unreal Tournament 3 X?\n\nForever in motion, the future is.\n\nWhy is Fortnite still not playable on Steam Deck?\n\nIf we only had a few more programmers. It\u2019s the Linux problem. I love the Steam Deck hardware. Valve has done an amazing job there; I wish they would get to tens of millions of users, at which point it would actually make sense to support it.\n\nIn October 2019, Epic internally said it might pursue an aggressive pursuit model with the Epic Games Store, where it would aggressively pay more for exclusive games and really pull in more and more users. Are you in the aggressive pursuit model?\n\nNo, we\u2019re in a different model, which is called the \u201cRidiculously aggressive pursuit model.\u201d If it\u2019s a 10-slide deck, that\u2019s on slide 11.\n\nDid you get a bingo on your Verge bingo card?\n\nYeah, I think it was almost a complete shutout. I think there was only one cell in the entire board that was missing. I was really impressed \u2014 the thing for that bingo card that really impressed me was \u201click the cookie.\u201d Do you remember? You may not even be old enough, but \u201click the cookie\u201d was in the 1999 US v. Microsoft antitrust trial."

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Tyler Mitchell was just 23 when he became the first black photographer to shoot the cover of American Vogue. His subject was Beyonc\u00e9, and his dreamy, delicately hued portraits spoke of a precocious visual talent. In the five years since, he has exhibited around the world, become an Instagram darling, with more than 500,00 followers, and shot what would become the most controversial vice-presidential portrait in living memory. When Mitchell\u2019s portrait of Kamala Harris dressed in sneakers and casual clothing was chosen for the cover of Vogue for February 2021, the social media backlash was swift. Critics questioned why his alternative image \u2013 in which Harris looked more, well, vice-presidential \u2013 hadn\u2019t been used instead. Bowing to the outrage over the perceived lack of respect shown to the first woman to reach such high office, the magazine later issued a limited edition using the more formal shot. The controversy did little to dent the New York-based photographer\u2019s reputation as a rising star of the medium and this month, three of his works can be seen in the NGV\u2019s Triennial exhibition. The first, Picnic, depicts a family gathering: young men throw a football, and a child is lifted on shoulders. There are wicker baskets and a thermos, and in the background, a darkened wood that perhaps hints at the fragility of a moment so peaceful and pure. Tyler Mitchell, Picnic. 2021 (detail). Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York In the other works, his figures are arranged across a sandy expanse in idealised depictions of black American leisure. In Albany, Georgia, a football flies through the air, a father in dress shirt and tails twirls a child, and a young boy rides a toy truck. Vastness focuses on a teenage boy who stands patiently as his younger siblings stretch his wildly elongated sleeves out beside him; nearby, a dog sits listening to a violinist. These carefully staged set-ups are evidence of Mitchell\u2019s desire to establish a new visual narrative for black Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that I am part of a longer lineage of black artists who have considered how they respond to the Western historical art canon, but also it\u2019s 2023, and it\u2019s a new day and I think beyond just responding to that canon, we\u2019re trying to use the limited language of pictures to try and imagine what personal and unencumbered freedom looks like for young black men and women today,\u201d he tells me when we chat in New York in the lead-up to the Triennial. Loading In one of his favourite works, A Glint of Possibility, a teenage boy hangs over a river suspended on a tyre swing, studying his own reflection. The moment is pensive and peaceful at once, and relatable to anyone who\u2019s ever been a child on a tyre swing on a hot summer day. Something about it speaks to the turmoil and tension inherent in the experience of black American teenage boys, about the ways their lives can be complicated by the world we all inhabit. How even when doing unremarkable things \u2013 walking home, playing in the park, talking to their crush \u2013 their lives can be destroyed or irrevocably altered. Mitchell understands the significance of these contrasts. His work exists in the tension between what is possible and how things are. He describes it as: \u201cA consideration of joy, perseverance and self-determination against the backdrop of history.\u201d Tyler Mitchell: \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Australia so it\u2019s very exciting to sort of have a global or new conversation on a new continent with my work.\u2033\u2063 Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York The theme of the Triennial is \u201cMagic, Matter, Memory\u201d, making Mitchell\u2019s pieces a logical inclusion. \u201cA lot of my work meditates on being between a heightened reality, or potentially even a magical reality and an actual reality,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m creating what I call lightly staged moments. And so that means I\u2019m setting up scenarios where these families are enjoying real moments of leisure in outdoor spaces, usually open pastures and fields, and those moments are meant to stand in for a meditation on what it means to enjoy leisurely outdoor nature as a black person.\u201d Tyler Mitchell, Vastness, 2021. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York In the listless anxious days of the pandemic, as the Black Lives Matter movement rose in the summer of 2020, and the conversation of what black life looked like was being routinely debated in the press, black artists and activists looked to reframe that conversation, and force new perspectives of peace, luxury, and safety into the picture. Instead of seeking to record things as they are, Mitchell\u2019s work asks us to imagine new realities. He says he wants to challenge \u201cvisual regimes\u201d: assumptions about certain people or cultures that are reinforced over and over again. \u201cI think that [photojournalism] is a well from which we all culturally \u2013 consciously or unconsciously \u2013 construct ideas of how people live around the world,\u201d he says. \u201cMy work is really about responding to, and questioning, and challenging those ideas.\u201d Tyler Mitchell Albany, Georgia, 2021 (detail). Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York As a 20-year-old film student at New York University, Mitchell became enamoured with still photography after he signed up to do a documentary photography course in Havana, Cuba. Frustrated by the amount of time and money required to make films, he was drawn to the accessibility of still photography.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was impatient when I got started and just wanted to make visual things now, and I didn\u2019t want to wait for permission, or didn\u2019t want to wait on equipment, or didn\u2019t want to lug large amounts of equipment up flights of stairs. I just wanted to make something that I felt compelled by, immediately,\u201d he says. His career has only blossomed in the years since he took that trip, and while some artists might feel trepidation at the attainment of so much success from such an early age, Mitchell is clear-eyed. \u201cThe idea of the road ahead only excites me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that there will be very quiet, sleepy periods, and frenetic periods, or hyperactive periods \u2026 It\u2019s always refreshing as a young person to see how the career of a much older, more senior artist has really gone. \u201cThat senior artist that we know and love today had decades where they were out of style, out of fashion, people thought their work was done, their best work was behind them, and yet, often had resurgences. Loading \u201cI think when we\u2019re thinking about crafting a career \u2026 we\u2019re really talking about allowing space for bad and good, allowing space for artists to make and work through complicated and sometimes not-so-favourable ideas. And I try to give myself that same space. It\u2019s only about giving yourself grace and space and thinking one day at a time.\u201d Asked if there\u2019s a dream project, or a dream collaborator for him, Mitchell says there are too many. But with one monograph (2020\u2019s I Can Make You Feel Good) under his belt, he\u2019s hungry to make more.\n\nAdvertisement"

    "body": "In March last year Graham Arnold seemed a dead man walking \u2013 the Socceroos World Cup qualification campaign was lurching towards failure and the manager was being battered from all sides.\n\nArnold\u2019s team had finished seven points off automatic qualification for Qatar after a shocking run of one win in seven games left them facing a Asian playoff against United Arab Emirates and then another against Peru to make the finals.\n\nWhile rumours swirled and ex-players and fans bayed for his blood, Football Australia took the pragmatic course and stuck by Arnold. It likely had more to do with the lateness of the hour and financial considerations than any overwhelming faith in Arnie to run around the fortunes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nBut he did just that with qualification \u2013 and an excellent run at the finals \u2013 bowing out to the eventual champions Argentina and after nearly taking them to extra time.\n\nHe got to answer critics like Mark Bosnich and Craig Foster as well \u2013 bluntly rejecting their negativity with the dismissive \u201cwho cares?\u201d. That would have tasted sweet.\n\nOn Tuesday, FA CEO James Johnson, who held firm on Arnold 20 months ago, got to congratulate the coach on his impending record-breaking match against Bangladesh as 2026 World Cup qualifying starts on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGraham is one of the greatest contributors to the Socceroos,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a constant in the Australian football landscape for more than 30 years as both a player and coach, being a part of some of the Socceroos most memorable moments.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows Arnie will tell you he bleeds green and gold. His love for the Socceroos and football in Australia is both infectious and inspiring. That energy and passion is a huge element to the way he\u2019s able to lead and inspire our nation\u2019s best male footballers in some of our sport\u2019s most challenging arenas.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Football Australia, I\u2019d like to congratulate Arnie on everything he\u2019s achieved in reaching this milestone and we look forward to him continuing to build on what is already an exceptional legacy.\u201d\n\nIn a remarkable few weeks last year Arnold went from on the nose to a man revived. Since then he\u2019s been linked to club jobs in Europe but opted to stick around with the national team.\n\nWhile national team coaches make important calls every game, Arnold\u2019s record-breaking achievement is conceivably down to one big ballsy call in the playoff against Peru.\n\nWith moments left in extra time against the South Americans, Arnold dragged Mat Ryan and replaced him with Andrew Redmayne \u2013 who saved the decisive spot kick (and also threw his opponents water bottle with cheat sheet attached away from the goal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan might well have gotten the Socceroos to Qatar, but if Australia had not advanced there\u2019s little chance Arnold would still be their coach today.\n\nAnd there\u2019s virtually no chance he\u2019ll have to endure a similar level of stress through to the next finals \u2013 with FIFA expanding the tournament from 36 to 48 teams meaning eight direct Asian confederation qualifiers will proceed directly instead of four.\n\nArnold, in his second stint as national team manager, will prowl the technical area for a 59th time on Thursday, taking him clear of Frank Farina.\n\nArnold \u2013 who also represented the Socceroos 56 times as a player \u2013 has been involved in national team coaching ranks since 2000, first as an assistant to Farina and then Guus Hiddink, before a brief period as caretaker coach in 2006.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a proud moment and an achievement that I\u2019ll reflect on when the time is right,\u201d Arnold said.\n\n\u201cI look at some of the names on that list \u2013 Farina, Arok, Thompson, Rasic \u2013 guys I played under or assisted in the early part of my coaching career, and it gives you some perspective on what a journey it\u2019s been so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think back to that caretaker period and how much I learnt about coaching; it was a challenging experience and one that on reflection I probably wasn\u2019t ready for. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity I was given and what it was able to teach me ahead of my pathway into club coaching.\n\n\u201cI was able to put lessons from that time into practice, develop and eventually return to the Socceroos much more prepared for the role. It\u2019s been a privilege to be part of the national team again with the benefit of that experience, and I\u2019m immensely proud of what this group has been able to achieve in the last four years.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, there\u2019s no greater honour than representing your nation on the international stage. I look at the young players coming through the Socceroos system now full of pride in the work they\u2019ve put in to get where they are, and the journey that\u2019s ahead of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved being a part of the Socceroos culture and my desire to see Australia fulfil its footballing potential is still driving me to take this group to further success.\u201d\n\nAustralia starts the road to north America in Melbourne at AAMI Park on Thursday night, before travelling to the Middle East to play Palestine next Wednesday (1.00am AEDT).\n\nFor this stage of qualifiers there are nine groups of four teams, with Lebanon the other team in Group I.\n\nThe top two teams from each group will advance into three groups of six for the next stage. The top two from those games \u2013 from September 2024 to June 2025 \u2013 will directly advance to the play offs with another qualifying round to determine the seventh and eight direct qualifiers."

    "body": "Beyonc\u00e9 ruled the box office this weekend.\n\nHer concert picture, \u201c Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d opened in first place with $21 million in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres Sunday.\n\nThe post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow, but \u201cRenaissance\u201d defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it\u2019s the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20 years (since \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d).\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 wrote, directed and produced \u201cRenaissance,\u201d which is focused on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where it earned $6.4 million from 2,621 theaters.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of AMC Theatres Distribution and the entire theatrical industry, we thank Beyonc\u00e9 for bringing this incredible film directly to her fans,\u201d said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theatres executive vice president of worldwide programming, in a statement. \u201cTo see it resonate with fans and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer, but as a producer and director.\u201d\n\nDespite several other new releases including \u201cGodzilla Minus One,\u201d the Hindi-language \u201cAnimal,\u201d Angel Studios\u2019 sci-fi thriller \u201cThe Shift,\u201d and Lionsgate\u2019s John Woo-directed revenge pic \u201cSilent Night,\u201d it was a slow weekend overall. Films in the top 10 are expected to gross only $85 million in total.\n\nBut it was in this traditional \u201clull\u201d that AMC Theatres found a good opportunity for \u201cRenaissance\u201d to shine.\n\n\u201cThey chose a great weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThere was competition but it was from very different kinds of movies.\u201d\n\nThough \u201cRenaissance\u201d did not come close to matching the $92.8 million debut of \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d in October, it\u2019s still a very good start for a concert film. No one expected \u201cRenaissance\u201d to match \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over $250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts (titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011 films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million.\n\nThe 39-city, 56-show \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour, which kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall, made over $500 million and attracted over 2.7 million concertgoers. Swift\u2019s ongoing \u201cEras Tour,\u201d with 151 dates, is expected to gross some $1.4 billion.\n\nBoth Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theatres to distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio. Both superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy appearances at the other\u2019s premieres. Both had previously released films on Netflix (\u201cMiss Americana\u201d and \u201cHomecoming\u201d). And both are reported to be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales.\n\nMovie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around $23.32 versus Swift\u2019s $20.78, according to data firm EntTelligence.\n\nCritics and audiences gave \u201cRenaissance\u201d glowing reviews \u2013 it\u2019s sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences who were polled. EntTelligence also estimates that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than Swift\u2019s.\n\n\u201cTo have two concert films topping the chart in a single year is pretty unprecedented,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nBut to compare them too closely would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cTaylor Swift was a total outlier and the result of a very specific set of circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThese two films are similar in genre only. \u201c\n\nLionsgate\u2019s \u201c The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes \u201d fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14.5 million. The prequel has now earned over $121 million domestically.\n\n\u201c Godzilla Minus One \u201d took third place on the North American charts with $11 million from 2,308 locations \u2014 the biggest opening for a foreign film in the U.S. this year. The well-reviewed Japanese blockbuster distributed by Toho International cost only $15 million to produce and has already earned $23 million in Japan. Toho\u2019s 33rd Godzilla film is set in the aftermath of World War II, stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and was directed by Takashi Yamazaki.\n\n\u201cThis year, we made a concentrated effort to answer the demand of the marketplace and make Godzilla globally accessible across many different platforms,\u201d said Koji Ueda, President of Toho Global, in a statement.\n\n\u201cTrolls Band Together\u201d landed in fourth place in its third weekend with $7.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.8 million.\n\nFifth place went to Disney\u2019s \u201cWish,\u201d which fell 62% from its underwhelming first weekend, with $7.4 million from 3,900 locations. Globally, it\u2019s now made $81.6 million. The studio\u2019s other major film in theaters, \u201cThe Marvels\u201d is also winding down in its fourth weekend with a disastrous global tally of $197 million against the reported $300 million it cost to make and market the superhero film.\n\nIn its second weekend, Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d earned an estimated $7.1 million from 3,500 locations. Produced by Apple Original Films and distributed by Sony Pictures, the film starring Joaquin Phoenix has now made $45.7 million domestically against a $200 million budget.\n\nThings should pick up in the final weeks of 2023, with films like \u201cWonka\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d yet to come. The industry is looking at a $9 billion year \u2014 still trailing the $11 billion pre-pandemic norm, but a marked improvement from the last few years. And there are still many solid options for moviegoers, as the industry\u2019s awards season gets into full swing.\n\n\u201cWe had a slow Thanksgiving and we\u2019re having a pretty slow weekend this weekend, but it\u2019s a great weekend to be a moviegoer in terms of the breadth and depth of the movies out there,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d $21 million.\n\n2. \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,\u201d $14.5 million.\n\n3. \u201cGodzilla Minus One,\u201d $11 million.\n\n4. \u201cTrolls Band Together,\u201d $7.6 million.\n\n5. \u201cWish,\u201d $7.4 million.\n\n6. \u201cNapoleon,\u201d $7.1 million.\n\n7. \u201cAnimal,\u201d $6.1 million.\n\n8. \u201cThe Shift,\u201d $4.4 million.\n\n9. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d $3 million.\n\n10. \u201cThanksgiving,\u201d $2.6 million."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nTravis Kelce\u2019s previous comments about having children have sparked controversy amid his ongoing romance with Taylor Swift.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs player, 34, first made the remarks about starting his own family during a February 2023 episode of his and his brother Jason Kelce\u2019s podcast, New Heights. The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce \u201chave talked about kids\u201d within the next year.\n\nIn the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was \u201crooting for,\u201d as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I\u2019ve given you grandkids,\u201d Jason, who shares three children \u2013 Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months \u2013 with wife Kylie Kelce, said. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?\u201d\n\nAfter Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for, \u201cif in a battle to the death,\u201d Donna responded by asking who he\u2019d pick to save if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean. While Donna said she couldn\u2019t pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked: \u201cRemember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.\u201d\n\nTravis then chimed in to joke about wanting to start his own family. \u201cI gotta start breeding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.\u201d\n\nJason then responded to his brother\u2019s remark with: \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d before Donna advised: \u201cWait until you find the right person. Find the right person.\u201d\n\nHowever, Travis still doubled down on his plan, as he quipped: \u201cI\u2019m gonna find a breeder, and I\u2019m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.\u201d\n\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, fans have called Travis out for his seemingly sexist remarks and claimed that he shouldn\u2019t have been referring to women as \u201cbreeders\u201d.\n\n\u201cForever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private,\u201d one wrote, referring to Swift\u2019s ex-boyfriend of six years.\u201cIt\u2019s what makes Travis Kelce\u2019s statements from earlier this year about \u2018finding a breeder\u2019 cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Start breeding,\u2019 oh this is just f***ing disgusting and it\u2019s setting us back so much,\u201d another added. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t baby-making machines, women are more than the man they\u2019re dating, we are more than marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t a Swiftie but don\u2019t have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women \u2018breeders,\u2019\u201d someone else wrote. \u201cThat ain\u2019t it dude.\u201d\n\nMany other people went on to criticise claims about Swift and Travis having children soon, since the singer is about to return to her Eras Tour until November 2024.\n\n\u201cWell I know for DAMN SURE that s*** about \u2018having kids within the next year\u2019 is NOT coming from Taylor\u2019s side,\u201d one claimed. \u201cShe\u2019s got the Eras Tour booked all through next year, and she\u2019d rather die than cancel a show. But we do know who\u2019s been public about looking for a \u2018BREEDER.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe comments about Travis and Swift\u2019s romance came days after they seemingly confirmed their relationship. On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift\u2019s fourth time attending one of Kelce\u2019s games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.\n\nFollowing the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce\u2019s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player\u2019s sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.\n\nIn addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift\u2019s boyfriend. After a fan shouted: \u201cLet\u2019s go Taylor\u2019s boyfriend\u201d while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.\n\nAside from their appearances at sports events, Swift and Kelce have also been photographed together on other occasions, including a date earlier this month in New York City after their surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live. At the time, sources alleged to Entertainment Tonight that, during the date, Kelce got a little too close to Swift\u2019s security personnel and allegedly told her bodyguard to step aside.\n\nHowever, during an episode of his podcast, Kelce explained what he said to the security, and clarified that he didn\u2019t push the bodyguard. \u201cI placed my hand on the gentleman\u2019s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce for contact."

Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d diverting customers\u2019 funds to Alameda.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy.

Ray III \u2014 you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried\u2019s conduct as \u201creally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried\u2019s statements that FTX was \u201cavoiding or managing conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cas a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms\u201d were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\n\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX\u2019s code that \u201cpermitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,\u201d which were created at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\n\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely \u2014 and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn\u2019t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s negative EV [this may mean \u201cexpected value,\u201d as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?\u201d LaVigne says. \u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets in November 2022 \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had him going out directly to the internet,\u201d LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren\u2019t true, that\u2019s more fodder for the government\u2019s case. \u201cThey can point to that and say, \u2018This is what he said, this is what actually happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend, may play an important role \u2014 Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\n\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy \u2014 and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\n\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn\u2019t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they\u2019re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don\u2019t get the outcome they want, they\u2019re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\n\nAlready, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn\u2019t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he\u2019s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome \u2014 implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance\u2019s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cAn idea like, \u2018Everyone was doing this, it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m the only one who was charged?\u2019\u201d That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\n\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\nIt\u2019s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that\u2019s a real problem for the industry\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime."

You are fighting for the things that happen in South Africa.\n\n\u201cYou are tackling for the boy who didn\u2019t get the same opportunities that you got eventually.\u201d\n\nFour years later and the \u201cego\u201d Erasmus spoke about is what is driving the standards and expectations around the Springboks\u2019 bid to go back-to-back.\n\n\u201cWe explain to the whole squad why we are going a certain route. It is not about individual selection,\u201d Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber said shortly after announcing two changes to his starting side and five in total, after going in with a forwards-heavy 7-1 bench split.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is for South Africa. As selectors we know there will be pressure on us if we don\u2019t deliver a result but at the back of our minds we know this selection is for South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe players take it like that. It is not about person or ego, not that they have egos, but you can\u2019t think of that. You have to think about South Africa and the Springboks.\u201d\n\nSeemingly the Springboks are playing for more than themselves. They\u2019re playing for their country.\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful force, one that saw them progress through the knockout stages to reach the final after consecutive one-point victories.\n\nPressure? The South African laughs at the notion of what pressure is compared to the inequality and challenges the Rainbow Nation continues to experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question is: how can New Zealand\u2019s All Blacks withstand and overcome the hitherto unshakable wave of momentum and spirit the Springboks play with under Erasmus in this weekend\u2019s World Cup final?\n\nIt would seem that, as the Springboks play for their country, the All Blacks are playing for themselves as much as anyone \u2013 and the generation of players and leaders that will call time on their international careers at week\u2019s end.\n\nThe backlash and toxicity that followed their historic home series loss to Ireland was a humbling and public reminder of the expectation of being an All Black.\n\nIt\u2019s why Saturday\u2019s World Cup final is personal for the men wearing black.\n\nAll Blacks social media managers were forced to delete a thousand comments an hour following the humbling series loss in Wellington.\n\nThe pain of the days and weeks after that dark July, as well as the bumps and bruises along the way, including as recently as August when they suffered their biggest defeat to the Boks to lose the inaugural and prestigious Qatar Cup, still runs deep.\n\n\u201cIt was quite special to hear some of the things those certain players said from the heart. You know, you think you know someone but once they open up and really be vulnerable in front of a team, it was quite special to hear,\u201d back-rower Dalton Papali\u2019i said this week.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was truly something special when you hear those boys open up. You know those leaders have been through a lot in their careers, the highs and the lows, the off-field and on-field stuff, and for them to open up, it sort of makes you feel welcomed and you want to play this game for them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were a few tears and I think that\u2019s awesome to see, players showing vulnerability, just opening up about how much this tour and this sort of game means.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were some (people) saying this is probably one of the most important games of All Blacks history. (The) All Blacks went through a bit of a hard path to get here, media, friends, family even criticising us and all that, and we stuck together. We weren\u2019t even said to be in the final and now look at us, we\u2019re here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDifferent players take it differently and some of the older players probably were hit a little bit harder and it was good to see just a bit of emotion and the want from them. Seeing that gives all the other players an extra two, three per cent to think \u2018OK, we are going to the well and we\u2019ve got to give it our all\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks will experience a changing of the guard next season.\n\nIndeed, the All Blacks\u2019 social media channels described the team selection for the World Cup final as the \u201cLast Dance\u201d.\n\n2015 World Cup winner Dane Coles will call time on his career, while his tight-five teammates Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock, who is bidding to become the first player to win the Webb Ellis Cup for a third time, will head overseas.\n\nFellow World Cup winners Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett will also head to Japan.\n\nColes, who was labelled by Samisoni Taukei\u2019aho as a \u201cGrandad\u201d type figure in the All Blacks, has even been denied the chance of a farewell send-off after missing selection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, tough,\u201d said coach Ian Foster of the conversation with the 36-year-old around leaving him out.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to talk too much about post-game stuff, but that was a tough one, probably the toughest I have had as a coach. He took it the way I expected him to. He\u2019s a champion.\u201d\n\nPapali\u2019i said the All Blacks were intent on sending their leaders out on a high.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few leaders in the team, it\u2019s going to be their last game in the jersey, so it\u2019s a big game for us and even the other players that are staying, knowing that we want to send those boys out on a high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow much they put into the jersey. We are standing on their\u2026what\u2019s that quote? It\u2019s standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d\n\nThe generational change isn\u2019t just occurring on the field but off it, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFoster will depart the All Blacks set up after 12 years, the last four as head coach.\n\nIt\u2019s been far from smooth, having overseen their historic defeats to Argentina as well as the 2-1 series loss to Ireland on home soil.\n\nA famous 35-23 win over the Springboks at Ellis Park saw him save his career, with Scott Robertson being lined up on the side.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough for New Zealand Rugby to back him before this year\u2019s Test season got underway, with Robertson announced as Foster\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cAm I at peace?\u201d Foster repeated a question during his World Cup team announcement when asked about where his mental state was ahead of his last Test in charge of the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m reasonably peaceful. I love the word but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m peaceful right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve just started to get my back nice and straight from last year and now you\u2019re trying to make me hunched over again!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the life of this business, it\u2019s a tough game. It\u2019s tough when you\u2019re trying to get your performance right. It\u2019s a tough game when people around you see things differently, but we\u2019ve learned a lot about ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe take massive pride in the jersey and making sure we reach the levels we want to. The rest of that is probably a conversation for another day.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t altered our vision of where we want this team to be. I know we\u2019ve surprised a few people but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve surprised ourselves.\u201d"

    "body": "Hollywood is a tough place to raise kids, prompting some celebrities to take a tough-love approach to parenting.\n\nStars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who admitted to being like a \"drill instructor\" when his kids were young, and Reese Witherspoon, who recently said she wants kids to deal with failure more directly, have shared their harsher parenting styles in interviews.\n\nOthers, like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, are focused on keeping their kids grateful for growing up in famous families with wealth and privilege at their fingertips.\n\nHere's a look at a few celebrity parents focusing on firmer parenting.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, who shares four children with ex-wife Maria Shriver and also shares a son with Mildred Baena, the family's former housekeeper, has a disciplined approach to parenting, recently admitting he had a \"drill instructor\" approach when his kids were young.\n\nIn a recent interview with People while promoting his new book, he recalled a moment when his eldest daughter, Katherine, brought over her 3-year-old daughter, Lyla, and saw the lesson he passed down.\n\n\"Katherine comes over with Lyla, and she says, 'Lyla, I told you already not to put the shoes there. Keep your shoes on, or you put them away, but you don't leave them there by the stand in front of the fireplace because you know what Daddy did? When I left my shoes there twice? The third time, he burned them in front of me and I cried,'\" he said.\n\nSchwarzenegger said the story was \"absolutely\" true, and he took pride in knowing that Katherine \"uses the same methods, which she cried over, and she complained about\" with Lyla as well as her other daughter, Eloise, both of whom she shares with husband Chris Pratt.\n\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER PRAISES DAUGHTER KATHERINE\u2019S PARENTING, REVEALS WHY GRANDKIDS LOVE COMING TO HIS HOME\n\nThe 76-year-old also shared similar tough-love approaches with his eldest son, Patrick.\n\nSchwarzenegger said that when he was 9, he threw his mattress outside after Patrick didn\u2019t make the bed.\n\n\"I opened up the door to the balcony, picked up the mattress and threw it down with the bedsheets, the pillows, everything. I said, 'Don't ever make someone come in and clean your room, clean your shower or make your bed,'\" he told People. \"I said, 'Because I taught you how to make the bed.'\"\n\nHe also battled over shower time with Patrick, feeling he was taking too long, and came up with a plan to limit them by installing a timer, similar to ones he\u2019d used in Munich.\n\n\"And so when he got the shower on, and he was whistling and singing in there and thinking Daddy's not around, all the sudden the ice-cold shower came on. And all of a sudden, we heard downstairs the scream,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nThe former California governor also recently issued a warning that if young people are over-pampered, this nation may be \"creating a generation of wimps and weak people.\"\n\n\"You can only strengthen your character and become a really strong person inside if you have resistance, if you fail, if you get up again and if you work hard,\" Schwarzenegger said on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\n\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S BODYBUILDER SON IS SPITTING IMAGE OF FAMOUS DAD\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nReese Witherspoon is a mom of three. She shares her eldest children, Ava and Deacon, with ex-husband Ryan Phillippe, and her youngest, Tennessee, with ex-husband Jim Toth.\n\nIn a recent interview on the \"Good Inside with Dr. Becky\" podcast, the Oscar-winner said she wants to see kids live with failure a little more.\n\n\"I see this a lot with parents \u2013 I don't know when we stopped letting our kids fail. Like I learned so much from the paper I didn't turn in or the demerits I got, so I got detention. I was suspended from school,\" she recalled.\n\nShe added, \"And my parents didn't say, \u2018Uh, she didn't deserve that,' and take me out of school. They actually let me sit in it and feel uncomfortable. So, I think learning from failure is actually a valuable tool that you can't take away from kids, right? You rob them if you don't let them sit in the discomfort of the experience.\"\n\nREESE WITHERSPOON AND EX JIM TOTH SETTLE DIVORCE WITH KEY STIPULATION ABOUT RAISING THEIR SON\n\nThe \"Walk the Line\" star remembered comforting her daughter when she was younger after she lost a basketball game \u2013 but not shying away from the lesson.\n\nWitherspoon recalled saying, \"'Yeah, I know. I know that probably feels really bad,'\" but then adding, \"'You know what also? Maybe you're not good at basketball?'\"\n\nHer daughter was slightly upset in the moment, but Witherspoon continued, \"It's actually really important to learn what you're not good at.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nDaniel Craig\n\nJames Bond star Daniel Craig shares one daughter with wife Rachel Weisz and has an older daughter from his previous marriage to Fiona Loudon. He is also step-dad to Weisz\u2019s son from a previous relationship.\n\nBut Craig\u2019s children shouldn\u2019t expect a pile of money when he\u2019s gone.\n\nIn an interview with Saga Magazine in 2020, Craig said, \"My philosophy is to get rid of it or give it away before you go. I don\u2019t want to leave great sums to the next generation.\"\n\nA year later in an interview with Candis magazine, he repeated the sentiment that inheritance is \"distasteful\" and pondered the overall nature of wealth.\n\n\"Isn't there an old adage that if you die a rich person, you've failed? I think Andrew Carnegie gave away what in today's money would be about 11 billion dollars, which shows how rich he was because I'll bet he kept some of it, too,\" he said.\n\nDANIEL CRAIG GIVES ADVICE TO NEXT JAMES BOND\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar\n\n\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" star Sarah Michelle Gellar and husband Freddie Prinze Jr. share two kids together and have been married for more than 20 years.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with Us Weekly, Prinze gave some details on how they parent their kids, now ages 13 and 11.\n\n\"We are strict as hell,\" the \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" star told the outlet. \"Look, I don\u2019t believe in whooping kids. I\u2019ve never whooped mine. My mom whooped me. They were, like, preventative whooping, so I know how to be strict.\"\n\nPrinze added that Gellar also knows how to be strict and has \"100 rules\" for their kids.\n\nSARAH MICHELLE GELLAR, FREDDIE PRINZE JR REVEAL SECRETS BEHIND THEIR LONG-LASTING MARRIAGE\n\n\"They know they can\u2019t break [those rules],\" he said. \"Friendships come and go. I tell my kids all the time that family is forever. So, we have rules, and they\u2019ve got to follow [them].\"\n\nGellar told Us Weekly in 2020 that as parents their \"expectations are a little higher than most.\"\n\n\"I think [our children] know what the rules are,\" she said at the time. \"We have [family dinner] as many nights as we can. We have no phones at the table. We sit, we all have dinner together.\"\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have been married since 2015 and share two children, daughter Wyatt, 9, and son Dmitri, 6.\n\nTo help keep their kids grounded, Kunis revealed in a 2020 interview on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" how she keeps their privilege in check.\n\n\"I like to remind them that Mommy and Daddy have money, but they\u2019re broke all the time,\" she said with a laugh. \"That is not their bedroom, it is my bedroom that I\u2019m letting them use, so they better take good care of it.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I say this in jest, but really they don\u2019t have things \u2026 they\u2019re raised on hand-me-downs from girlfriends\u2019 kids\u2019 clothing; we garden.\"\n\nKunis noted her kids are lucky to be born into a famous family and wants to ensure they are grateful.\n\n\"Our kids are super-fortunate,\" she said. \"Regardless, they were born at the right time to the right people, and I love them, but they\u2019re not going to be entitled a--holes.\"\n\nMILA KUNIS AND ASHTON KUTCHER LAUGH OFF CRITICISM RECEIVED FOR THEIR BATHING ROUTINE CONFESSION\n\nCandace Cameron Bure\n\n\"Full House\" star Candace Cameron Bure is a proud mom of three with husband Valeri Bure: Natasha, Lev and Maksim, who are now all in their early 20s.\n\nWhen her kids were teenagers, Bure spoke with L.A. Parent about her parenting style, noting that she can be \"strict.\"\n\n\"I hope my kids would say that I\u2019m a loving mom,\" Bure said. \"They would also describe me as strict. We set firm boundaries, but there is always love and grace.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I\u2019m the mom that needs to meet the parents before my kids can go to a new friend\u2019s house. I want to know who they\u2019re with, where they\u2019re going. Even now that they\u2019re driving, I want them to text me when they arrive and when they\u2019re heading home.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nBure explained that they \"work hard to keep our communication open and talk through any situation\" and they are \"always willing to listen.\"\n\n\"But I don\u2019t always say yes,\" she added. \"My goal as a parent is not to make my kids happy but to guide them to be respectful, curious, responsible, resilient, kind, giving and thoughtful adults.\"\n\nNATASHA BURE PRAISES MOM CANDACE CAMERON FOR HER FAITH, BEING 'BOLD' AMID BACKLASH\n\nKristen Bell and Dax Shepard\n\nKristen Bell and Dax Shepard share two daughters together, Lincoln, 10, and Delta, 8, and have been married for 10 years.\n\nThe couple has been honest about the trials and tribulations of raising their kids, especially to keep them grounded.\n\n\"It\u2019s very important to me that they share a bedroom. I think their lives will be easier than most other people\u2019s on the planet, and to develop a good character, it\u2019s important to always be going through something,\" Bell told Self in 2020.\n\n\"I like the fact that they will have to figure out how to share a bedroom, figure out how to share your closet, figure out how to share your space,\" she continued. \"If that\u2019s the worst thing about your life, that you have to share a bedroom with your sister, you\u2019re going to be OK.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBell also laid out her strict screen-time rules, but she admits they get a little lax on the weekends.\n\n\"They\u2019re not allowed to play with our phones or have any screens really. They are allowed to watch TV on the weekends, and we\u2019re pretty liberal with it, which I\u2019ve been considering paying more attention to,\" she said. \"But since they\u2019re not allowed at all during the week, they will wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, and they will watch TV until noon. I will also sleep until 9:45, which is really nice, and then get stuff done.\"\n\nThe \"Frozen\" star added, \"But I will say, I notice how hard it is to pull them away from the TV at noon.\""

Gellar - who shares son Rocky, 11, and daughter Charlotte Grace, 14, with husband Freddie Prinze Jr - shared a screenshot from her iPhone, displaying a notification that her iCloud account \u201chas been disabled\u201d in the App Store and iTunes.\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been dealing with after my son\u2019s @Roblox got hacked,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram Story. \u201cI had to cancel my credit card and now my life is basically cancelled.\u201d\n\nThe Cruel Intentions actor added: \u201c@Roblox Why don\u2019t you have better parental help?!?\u201d\n\nRoblox is a widely-popular online game platform that \u201clets you play, create, and be anything you can imagine,\u201d according to its description on the Microsoft Store. It allows players to customise characters and play minigames within the game. While Roblox is free to download on a number of platforms - including Android and iOS smartphones, Xbox game consoles, and Windows computers - players can also spend money on in-game items and customisations. According to TechCrunch, its millions of users range between ages eight and 18, although its key demographic is between nine and 15 years old.\n\n(Instagram / Sarah Michelle Gellar)\n\nMany social media users on X, formerly known as Twitter, were surprised by Gellar\u2019s unexpected feud with the online gaming platform.\n\n\u201cThis is the most important beef of 2023,\u201d one person said, in response to Gellar\u2019s Instagram Story post.\n\n\u201cBuffy vs Roblox is where all this Millennial vs Gen Z discourse has been heading,\u201d another user joked.\n\nWhile one user agreed that \u201cbeing hacked on Roblox is life ruining,\u201d someone else wondered why Gellar\u2019s 11-year-old son was using his mother\u2019s credit card in the first place. \u201cOh please. That\u2019s not that bad,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why parents let their children use their debit/credit cards on games, like, make them pay themselves!\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, a Roblox spokesperson revealed the company is looking into Gellar\u2019s complaint. \u201cWe are looking into this case and we reached out directly to the user to help. We are committed to ensuring that our users have a positive experience on the platform,\u201d they said. \u201cIn partnership with safety groups, we\u2019ve developed tools and resources like our Parent & Caregiver Guide and other helpful resources for parents to have conversations with their kids and teens about staying safe, spending controls and protecting their account. Our support team works with parents and users directly 24/7 and can be contacted with questions here,\u201d they added, including a link to its support page.\n\nThe Scooby-Doo star isn\u2019t the only celebrity to publicly call out Roblox\u2019s parental controls. In the season one premiere of The Kardashians, Hulu star Kim Kardashian went head to head with Roblox after her son Saint discovered what claimed to be unseen footage of her 2007 sex tape with her ex-boyfriend Ray J.\n\nSaint, eight, was playing Roblox on a family member\u2019s iPad when an icon of Kardashian\u2019s infamous crying face popped up on his screen. When he showed his mother the icon, she pulled the iPad away after reading that the Roblox minigame had been registered under the username \u201cKimsNewSexTape\u201d.\n\nThe billionaire business mogul later shared in the episode that she planned on \u201csuing\u201d Roblox for using her name and likeness for a game. \u201cI have all the time, all the money, and all of the resources to burn them all to the f***ing ground,\u201d Kardashian said, adding: \u201cThis is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old tape, this is the last thing I want as a mom, for my past to be brought up 20 years later.\u201d\n\nAccording to Polygon, the developer of the minigame was reportedly banned from the online platform when the episode aired in April 2022. In a statement to the outlet, a spokesperson from Roblox confirmed the existence of the game, but explained that the \u201creferenced video was never available on our platform\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe referenced video was never available on our platform - we have strict moderation and policies to protect our community, including zero tolerance for sexual content of any kind which violates our Community Rules,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to an extremely small number of people on the platform. We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident.\u201d"

    "body": "From From Carolina Panthers Round 1 - Pick 1 Caleb Williams QB USC \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 215 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 2nd POSITION RNK 1st Justin Fields is expected to return to the field this week, but is it too little, too late? Chicago will have a chance to take a quarterback No. 1 overall and it may be too much to pass up a second consecutive year.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 2 Drake Maye QB North Carolina \u2022 Soph \u2022 6'4\" / 230 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Giants PROSPECT RNK 5th POSITION RNK 2nd There was doubt about Daniel Jones' viability as a long-term starter when he signed his extension. Following his ACL injury, there is no less concern. New York will have to eat a grandiose amount of dead salary cap but it is a small price to pay if Drake Maye ends up being the quarterback many expect he could be.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 3 Marvin Harrison Jr. WR Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 205 lbs Projected Team New England PROSPECT RNK 1st POSITION RNK 1st Marvin Harrison Jr. is arguably the best talent available in the 2024 NFL Draft, but does that matter if he is catching passes from Mac Jones or Bailey Zappe? The Patriots have to be hopeful that they find themselves in a position to draft one of the two top quarterback prospects.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 4 Olumuyiwa Fashanu OT Penn State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" / 317 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 3rd POSITION RNK 1st When a new homeowner moves in, they often have a different vision of how to decorate the space. Jonathan Gannon and Monti Ossenfort are the new homeowners and they could move on from D.J. Humphries and save money toward the salary cap while likely upgrading at the position.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 5 Dallas Turner EDGE Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 252 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 14th POSITION RNK 3rd Chicago traded for and signed Montez Sweat to a lucrative contract extension but Yannick Ngakoue has given them nothing. The addition of Dallas Turner allows them to have a potentially dynamic duo.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 6 Joe Alt OT Notre Dame \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'7\" / 322 lbs Projected Team Green Bay PROSPECT RNK 7th POSITION RNK 3rd The David Bakhtiari experience may be over in Green Bay but there is a tantalizing off-ramp with the addition of Joe Alt.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 7 JC Latham OT Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" / 360 lbs Projected Team L.A. Rams PROSPECT RNK 6th POSITION RNK 2nd Los Angeles' offensive tackles have had two of the highest beaten rates in the NFL this season, according to TruMedia. JC Latham allows them to upgrade on one side of the line.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 8 Brock Bowers TE Georgia \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 240 lbs Projected Team Tennessee PROSPECT RNK 4th POSITION RNK 1st Brock Bowers is the lone remaining blue-chip talent. If Will Levis is the future then they need to surround him with the skill talent that may give him a chance to succeed.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 9 Jared Verse EDGE Florida State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 260 lbs Projected Team Atlanta PROSPECT RNK 12th POSITION RNK 2nd Atlanta likes heavy-handed pass rushers who can set the edge and Jared Verse falls into that category. The Falcons have added some older veterans at the position but it is not a viable long-term solution.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 10 Laiatu Latu EDGE UCLA \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'5\" / 265 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 11th POSITION RNK 1st After moving on from Chase Young and Montez Sweat, Washington has a need for rushing the passer. Laiatu Latu may end up being the best out of this draft class.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 11 J.J. McCarthy QB Michigan \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" / 202 lbs Projected Team Tampa Bay PROSPECT RNK 21st POSITION RNK 4th Baker Mayfield is replaced in Tampa Bay with J.J. McCarthy. It was a Michigan quarterback that led the Buccaneers to the promised land last time so perhaps lightning strikes twice.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 12 Amarius Mims OT Georgia \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'7\" / 340 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Jets PROSPECT RNK 23rd POSITION RNK 4th The top-10 selections were not kind to a New York team that desperately needs offensive tackle help. The Jets select Amarius Mims, who is young and inexperienced, to upgrade the ceiling of their protection.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 13 Jer'Zhan Newton DL Illinois \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" / 295 lbs Projected Team Denver PROSPECT RNK 27th POSITION RNK 2nd Jer'Zhan Newton infuses some youth into a unit that was not long ago a strength for the Broncos. Newton is a high-motor player who will help establish the culture in Denver.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 14 Kool-Aid McKinstry CB Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 195 lbs Projected Team L.A. Chargers PROSPECT RNK 9th POSITION RNK 2nd J.C. Jackson never became what the Chargers had hoped when they signed him. His spot in the lineup has not been filled with a long-term candidate. Kool-Aid McKinstry is a good value midway through the first round.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 15 Malik Nabers WR LSU \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'0\" / 200 lbs Projected Team Indianapolis PROSPECT RNK 13th POSITION RNK 2nd Michael Pittman Jr. is scheduled to be a free agent at season's end. If the two parties can not come to terms, Malik Nabers is a good partner for Josh Downs.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 16 Nate Wiggins CB Clemson \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" / 185 lbs Projected Team Las Vegas PROSPECT RNK 19th POSITION RNK 3rd The thought of Las Vegas taking another cornerback in the first round has to be terrifying for Raiders fans but the reality is that it remains a position of need for the AFC franchise despite adding Patriots castoff Jack Jones this week.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 17 Cooper DeJean CB Iowa \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 207 lbs Projected Team Buffalo PROSPECT RNK 38th POSITION RNK 7th It was learned Wednesday that Cooper DeJean's season, and potentially Iowa career, is over. Buffalo adds him in the first round to fill out its secondary.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 18 Keon Coleman WR Florida State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 215 lbs Projected Team Cincinnati PROSPECT RNK 16th POSITION RNK 3rd Tee Higgins and Cincinnati will likely part ways after the season, which creates a need in that offense. Keon Coleman is a big-bodied receiver who can win jump balls down the field.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 19 JT Tuimoloau EDGE Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 270 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 15th POSITION RNK 4th New Orleans adds a powerful rusher to its repertoire. Cam Jordan is 34 years old and has two years remaining on his contract. The Saints have a quality rotation of rushers until JT Tuimoloau eventually takes over.\n\nFrom From Houston Texans Round 1 - Pick 20 Chop Robinson EDGE Penn State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" / 254 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 29th POSITION RNK 6th Arizona adds an edge rusher with higher upside to Jonathan Gannon's defense.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 21 Jayden Daniels QB LSU \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'4\" / 210 lbs Projected Team Minnesota PROSPECT RNK 76th POSITION RNK 8th The Joshua Dobbs story has been fun but the reality is that Kirk Cousins will be a free agent after the season and the organization could opt for a change. Jayden Daniels has been one of the most productive quarterbacks in football.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 22 Emeka Egbuka WR Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 206 lbs Projected Team Dallas PROSPECT RNK 20th POSITION RNK 4th Dallas retools at wide receiver with CeeDee Lamb and Emeka Egbuka. The franchise has struggled to find a reliable complement to Lamb since the departure of Amari Cooper.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 23 Taliese Fuaga OL Oregon State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" / 334 lbs Projected Team Pittsburgh PROSPECT RNK 17th POSITION RNK 1st Pittsburgh probably has some offensive soul-searching ahead but there is no question that the addition of more protection is a sound investment.\n\nFrom From Cleveland Browns Round 1 - Pick 24 Bralen Trice EDGE Washington \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 274 lbs Projected Team Houston PROSPECT RNK 26th POSITION RNK 5th DeMeco Ryans is not going to settle for one or two pass rushers. He wants an Army. Bralen Trice paired with Jonathan Greenard and Will Anderson Jr. is a solid foundation.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 25 Denzel Burke CB Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 190 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 36th POSITION RNK 6th Injuries have plagued Miami's cornerback room. So the Dolphins add more depth in the form of Ohio State's Denzel Burke.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 26 Tyler Nubin S Minnesota \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'2\" / 210 lbs Projected Team Seattle PROSPECT RNK 44th POSITION RNK 2nd Seattle adds a ballhawk who can help capitalize on the chaos created by a surprisingly active defensive front over the past month. The Seahawks have already invested in the unit with the additions of Riq Woolen and Devon Witherspoon in back-to-back years.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 27 Rome Odunze WR Washington \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" / 215 lbs Projected Team Jacksonville PROSPECT RNK 31st POSITION RNK 6th Jacksonville clears the deck and starts anew with Calvin Ridley and Rome Odunze. The Jaguars have to figure out their protection issues this offseason, though.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 28 Kingsley Suamataia OT BYU \u2022 Soph \u2022 6'6\" / 325 lbs Projected Team San Francisco PROSPECT RNK 37th POSITION RNK 7th San Francisco needs to make multiple changes to its offensive line this offseason. Replacing Colton McKivitz with Kingsley Suamataia is Stage 1 of the transformation.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 29 Kalen King CB Penn State \u2022 Jr \u2022 5'11\" / 190 lbs Projected Team Baltimore PROSPECT RNK 8th POSITION RNK 1st Marlon Humphrey and the entire Baltimore secondary has struggled to stay healthy. Kalen King adds some depth to the unit.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 30 Graham Barton OT Duke \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'5\" / 314 lbs Projected Team Detroit PROSPECT RNK 35th POSITION RNK 6th Jonah Jackson and Halapoulivaati Vaitai are slated to hit free agency. If one or both leave, then it creates a void in Detroit's offensive line. Enter Graham Barton, who has played left tackle for the Blue Devils but projects inside.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 31 Kris Jenkins DL Michigan \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'3\" / 305 lbs Projected Team Kansas City PROSPECT RNK 43rd POSITION RNK 5th Kansas City adds depth to its interior defensive line with the addition of Michigan's Kris Jenkins."

    "body": "On the field, Michigan is in the midst of what could be a historic season. Off the field, the the focus has rarely been on the team's success.\n\nAn investigation into Michigan's alleged sign-stealing scheme, centered on now-fired staffer Connor Stalions, continues to evolve by the hour, with one update after another adding another wrinkle to the saga that began in October. The Big Ten suspended coach Jim Harbaugh for three games on Friday with the team on a plane en route to Penn State, and although Michigan had hoped to block the suspension, the Wolverines will be without their coach on the sidelines in Happy Valley.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking the latest updates from the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. Follow along with the newest developments below.\n\nMORE ON MICHIGAN SIGN-STEALING:\n\nMichigan sign-stealing scandal updates\n\nFriday, Nov. 17\n\nMichigan fires coach connected to destroying evidence in investigation\n\nYahoo Sports' Ross Dellenger and Dan Wetzel reported on Friday that the NCAA's investigation into the sign-stealing and advanced scouting operation has found that Stalions was at least partially funded by a Michigan booster, named as \"Uncle T,\" and that linebackers coach Chris Partridge, who was fired by Michigan on Friday, is alleged to have destroyed evidence on a computer pertaining to the sign-stealing allegations.\n\nThe report states Partridge is not believed to have had prior knowledge of the sign-stealing operation, but then later worked to cover it up. In a statement on his firing, Michigan appeared to indicate a connection between Partridge and the NCAA's investigation, which Dellenger and Wetzel reported is still in the early stage:\n\nFrom the outset, our focus has been on seeking due process and allowing the NCAA to conduct a fair and deliberate investigation. Although the Big Ten has closed its investigation, we are continuing to cooperate with the NCAA as it moves forward with its ongoing investigation. Consistent with our commitment to integrity, we will continue to take the appropriate actions, including disciplinary measures, based on information we obtain. Earlier today, Michigan Athletics relieved Chris Partridge of his duties as a member of the Michigan Football staff. Due to employee privacy laws, we are unable to comment further.\"\n\nBecause Michigan and Harbaugh on Thursday dropped their litigation against the Big Ten, he will not be on Michigan's sideline this week against Maryland and next week against Ohio State to end the regular season.\n\nFormer Wolverines assistant and Harbaugh confidant Biff Poggi on Friday offered his former boss an invitation. Poggi, in his first year as Charlotte's head coach, asked Harbaugh to join the 49ers for their games vs. Rice on Saturday and at South Florida on Nov. 25.\n\nI am extending an open invitation to Jim Harbaugh to join me on the sidelines for the next two Charlotte football games. It would be my honor to stand next to you again as we did for three years \u2014 Biff poggi (@BiffPoggi) November 17, 2023\n\nThursday, Nov. 16\n\nMichigan accepts Harbaugh's three-game suspension\n\nMichigan has dropped its litigation against the Big Ten over Harbaugh's three-game suspension, and it will accept the punishment levied against the head coach.\n\nFrom Michigan:\n\n\"This morning, the University, Coach Harbaugh, and the Big Ten resolved their pending litigation. The Conference agreed to close its investigation, and the University and Coach Harbaugh agreed to accept the three-game suspension. Coach Harbaugh, with the University's support, decided to accept this sanction to return the focus to our student-athletes and their performance on the field. The Conference has confirmed that it is not aware of any information suggesting Coach Harbaugh's involvement in the allegations. The University continues to cooperate fully with the NCAA's investigation.\n\nFrom the Big Ten:\n\n\"The Big Ten Conference's commitment to student-athletes, sportsmanship and the commissioner's duty to protect the integrity of competition will never waver. Today's decision by the University of Michigan to withdraw its legal challenge against the conference's November 10th notice of disciplinary action is indicative of the high standards and values that the conference and the university seek to uphold, the University of Michigan is a valued member of the Big Ten Conference and the conference will continue to work cooperatively with the university and the NCAA during this process.\"\n\nMonday, Nov. 13\n\nHarbaugh says he'll state his case at Friday hearing\n\nDespite the suspension, Jim Harbaugh held his usual weekly news conference Monday, though he mostly avoided addressing the only topic on anyone's mind.\n\nHe initially told reporters he would speak during a scheduled hearing Friday, but then backtracked a bit and sounded as if he wasn't committed to that course, pending legal advice.\n\nHarbaugh said he will speak at the hearing on Friday. He said he\u2019s looking for \u201cdue process.\u201d Mentioned a civics class he took 40 years ago. \u201cYou\u2019re innocent until proven guilty. I\u2019d like that opportunity.\u201d \u2014 Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) November 13, 2023\n\nHarbaugh clarifies that he\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll testify Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s not my dance floor,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of shows. I\u2019ve watched Judge Judy a lot.\u201d \u2014 Austin Meek (@byAustinMeek) November 13, 2023\n\nSunday, Nov. 12\n\nU-M president praises Wolverines for handling 'challenges and adversity'\n\nThe day after the Penn State win, University of Michigan President Santa Ono posted on social media, praising the team's ability to \"respond to any challenge head on with a conviction to do better and to emerge even stronger.\"\n\nCountless members of the University of Michigan family have reached out to me over the weekend and I wanted to express my appreciation. Like any community, we face our share of challenges and adversity. There have been many such moments in our history. But as our team showed so\u2026 \u2014 Santa Ono (@SantaJOno) November 12, 2023\n\nThe post drew immediate and extensive blowback on social media and beyond, as observers questioned Ono's tone with Michigan in the midst of a self-inflicted controversy.\n\nSaturday, Nov. 11\n\nWarde Manuel issues strong statement against Big Ten\n\nMichigan athletic director Warde Manuel did not mince words in a statement on the Big Ten's suspension of Harbaugh. He said while the program has been disappointed to hear about the allegations, it also feels that the conference skipped due process of a complete investigation in suspending Harbaugh on Friday.\n\nManuel described the suspension as \"completely unethical\" and \"an assault on the rights of everyone (especially in the Big Ten) to be judged by a fair and complete investigation.\"\n\n\"All of the Head Coaches in the Big Ten (some who have been accused of actively participating in the trading of signals of opponents) and my Big Ten AD colleagues can rejoice today that someone was 'held accountable,' but they should be worried about the new standard of judgment (without complete investigation) that has been unleashed in this conference,\" Manuel said.\n\nStatement from Michigan AD Warde Manuel. \u201cI find that completely unethical, insulting to a well-established process within the NCAA, and an assault on the rights of everyone (especially in the Big Ten) to be judged by a fair and complete investigation.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Qm9iehYVTR \u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) November 11, 2023\n\nHarbaugh will not be on the sidelines vs. Penn State\n\nMichigan filed a temporary restraining order against the Big Ten on Friday night, hoping to block Harbaugh's suspension. But there will not be a ruling before the Wolverines' game vs. Penn State, with the hearing scheduled for Friday, Nov. 17.\n\nNo ruling on Michigan\u2019s TRO filing today, so Jim Harbaugh will not coach vs. Penn State.\n\n\n\nStatement from the school: \u201cWe look forward to presenting our case next week where we intend to demonstrate that the Big Ten has not acted legally or fairly.\u201d \u2014 Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) November 11, 2023\n\nHarbaugh hearing coming down to wire before Penn State game\n\nESPN's Pete Thamel reported it's unclear Harbaugh will be granted a hearing in time to be able to coach against Penn State. With kickoff scheduled for noon ET, Thamel said \"the drama's going to go right up 'till noon.\"\n\nLatest from \u2066@CollegeGameDay\u2069 on Jim Harbaugh\u2019s TRO legal filing.

If granted, the suspension would be delayed, but the clock is ticking before the Wolverines' game vs. Penn State on Saturday.\n\nMichigan's temporary restraining order request has been filed.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs: Jim Harbaugh, U-M regents\n\nDefendants: Big Ten, Tony Petitti\n\n\n\nJudicial officer: Timothy P.

McCarthy and a handful of other Michigan players tweeted \"Bet\" at the same time on Friday night, hours after Harbaugh was suspended for the remainder of the regular season.

The letter outlines Michigan's belief that the Big Ten would be acting too hastily in suspending Harbaugh or levying any punishment toward Michigan before the completion of a full NCAA investigation.\n\nIn the letter, Michigan said the university has not had the chance to review all the evidence and respond, which oversteps the due process allowed for Michigan. It said Pettiti should not have unilateral authority to punish violations without first having a completed investigation and then a response from the Compliance and Reinstatement Committee, which would recommend penalties for rules violations.\n\nMichigan noted that regarding evidence, there is nothing it is aware of to claim athletics personnel at Michigan committed the allegations, and said the rule pertaining to electronic recordings of games is limited to the use of field equipment used by the institution for the game it is currently playing. It also said Michigan has not seen much evidence, but rather has just heard a summary of second- and third-hand information.\n\nThe letter also said given the use of sign decoding by other universities, there is little reason to believe Stalions' efforts proved meaningful, and pointed out the teams' average margin of victory since Stalions was suspended. It said the information obtained is \"at most a reflection of information that teams can and easily do obtain through public and permissible sources,\" and because of that it is \"highly dubious\" that Stalions' observations would have a \"material effect on the integrity of the competition.\"\n\nHere is Michigan\u2019s 10-page letter to the Big Ten responding to the sportsmanship investigation, reporting with @RossDellenger 1/3 pic.twitter.com/P0oYgIbS67 \u2014 Dan Wetzel (@DanWetzel) November 9, 2023\n\nNo timetable for Big Ten decision\n\nThe Big Ten is reviewing the \"lengthy\" official response from Michigan and Jim Harbaugh and it's unclear when a potential ruling might come down, says ESPN's Pete Thamel.

The person who supplied the documents told The Athletic he spent 10 to 12 hours per week trying to decode signals based on game video and said the practice of sharing decoded signals with other schools is common.\n\nHowever, the primary difference is Michigan is accused of using in-person scouting, which has been prohibited under NCAA rules for nearly 30 years, to acquire its information.\n\nMonday, Nov. 6\n\nNo connection between Buckeyes coach, Michigan investigation\n\nOhio State coach Ryan Day and his family have no connection to the Big Ten and NCAA investigations into Michigan, Yahoo Sports reported.\n\nA report emerged over the weekend indicating Day may have had some involvement in the probe into the Buckeyes' arch-rivals, but the NCAA told the Big Ten there are no ties that it knows of between the Ohio State coach and the investigation.\n\nNCAA shares findings with Big Ten as Harbaugh suspension looms\n\nYahoo Sports reported Monday that the NCAA shared its investigation findings with the Big Ten, noting that the findings \"do not connect the in-person scouting and recording of opponents\u2019 sidelines to Harbaugh.\"\n\nStill, the conference is considering a suspension for Harbaugh and could hand down punishments before the end of the week.\n\nYahoo says a multi-game suspension for Harbaugh is on the table, though Michigan is fully expected to fight a ban if one is handed down. It would be Harbaugh's second suspension of the season, as the Wolverines self-imposed a three-game ban on Harbaugh to start the season amid an NCAA investigation that found Harbaugh lied to investigators.\n\nSaturday, Nov. 4\n\nHarbaugh 'likely' to be suspended\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Pete Thamel, the Big Ten might be getting closer to handing down a suspension for Harbaugh.\n\n\"Over the past few days, Petitti has spoken with the athletic directors, he's spoken with the presidents, he's spoken with the coaches. And the next steps appear that there will be some type of punishment for Michigan. The most likely scenario here is some type of suspension for Jim Harbaugh,\" Thamel said on ESPN's \"College GameDay.\"\n\nMORE: Why Jim Harbaugh won't find refuge in the NFL\n\nIt was reported earlier in the week that coaches were putting pressure on the Big Ten to hit Michigan with some form of punishment, with Purdue's Ryan Walters publicly calling for action and claiming the allegations are no longer simply allegations.\n\nHarbaugh was already suspended three games at the start of the season, in a ban imposed by the school itself in an attempt to ward off a separate NCAA investigation.\n\nFriday, Nov. 3\n\nSuspended football analyst Connor Stalions resigns\n\nMichigan football analyst Connor Stalions, the focus of the NCAA's investigation, resigned on Friday night, the university confirmed.\n\nStatement from Michigan (confirming earlier reports that Connor Stalions is no longer with the program): \"Connor Stalions resigned his position with Michigan Athletics this afternoon. We are unable to comment further regarding this personnel matter.\" \u2014 Jesse Dougherty (@dougherty_jesse) November 4, 2023\n\nIn a statement, Stalions' lawyer said that his client hoped to avoid creating more distractions for Michigan and denied that any Wolverines staffer \"told anyone to break any rules.\"\n\nMORE: Who is Connor Stalions?\n\nStalions is accused of buying numerous tickets to scout future opponents in-person, which is against NCAA rules. The NCAA is also investigating the possibility that Stalions appeared on Central Michigan's sideline in Chippewas gear for a game against Michigan State.\n\nStalions was suspended by Michigan when the news of his alleged involvement first broke."

    "body": "Fate of US venture capital in China teeters on uncertainty Tech crackdown in China and US scrutiny drive some of these VCs to look abroad\n\nOn a weekday afternoon at Red Rock Coffee, the caf\u00e9 known for spotting venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, one is likely to overhear a few conversations in Mandarin. With China reopening its borders this spring following three years of COVID-19 restrictions, managers of U.S. funds in the country have been flocking to the Bay Area. While these trips were routine before the pandemic, they have now taken on a fresh purpose of discovering deals beyond China.\n\nUSD-denominated funds in China have long been drawing inspiration from Silicon Valley startups, using them as benchmarks for investment targets back home. They would seek out the equivalents of Facebook, Amazon and Uber on the other side of the Pacific Ocean and hope they become winners in the country\u2019s largely untapped internet market.\n\nThis dealmaking strategy of American funds in China has become less effective in the face of shifting global and domestic landscapes. Driven by a confluence of factors, from China\u2019s crackdown on the tech industry to escalating U.S.-China tensions, some of these investors are now turning their gaze to opportunities abroad, tracing the footsteps of a new generation of Chinese-founded startups that are expanding overseas.\n\nBetween a rock and a hard place\n\nSince their entry into China in the late 1990s, American venture capital firms, led by powerhouses like Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital and GGV, have played a major role in funding high-risk, high-reward startups in the country\u2019s consumer internet sector. This two-decade-long mutually beneficial relationship, however, now hangs in the balance as changes at home and abroad diminish the pool of investment opportunities for outside financiers.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing\u2019s sweeping tech crackdowns have introduced a new sense of uncertainty to investors. VCs fear that their portfolio companies might encounter a fate akin to that of Ant Group, whose colossal initial public offering was called off, and Didi, which weathered an extensive data security probe that eventually led to its delisting from New York. With China tightening its grip on overseas IPOs, investors who once relied on taking Chinese firms public in the U.S. are no longer assured of an exit channel.\n\nIn the meantime, Washington has stepped up restrictions on the flow of U.S. money into China amid an escalating tech war between the two superpowers. In August, President Joe Biden signed an executive order barring U.S. investments in three strategically critical sectors in China \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors.\n\nAs USD funds in China await further clarity on the scope of the ban, they are practicing more discretion than ever before. They slow down capital deployment even amidst a global AI fervor that has given rise to a parallel AI universe in China. At the same time, domestic RMB funds play an increasing role in funding critical tech sectors. Zhipu AI, one of China\u2019s most ambitious challengers to OpenAI, for instance, raised financing in RMB instead of USD.\n\nEven having the Chinese branches of famed American VCs listed on the cap table might deter U.S. investors from funding Chinese founders in their backyard. Local investors are now shunning Chinese \u201clinks\u201d, of which definition is ever evolving and broadening, at all costs.\n\nThe country\u2019s USD investors continue to deploy capital in industries that aren\u2019t in the crosshairs of U.S.-China competition, but overall, their activity has dwindled significantly due to the changing regulatory and geopolitical currents, coupled with a slowing economy. The year 2022 saw just $14.5 billion invested in Chinese companies by U.S.-headquartered VCs, compared to $45.4 billion the year before, according to a report from research firm PitchBook. The number of deals nearly halved to 595, and the share of deals with U.S. investor participation dropped to 18.2% in 2022 after hovering above 30% for half a decade.\n\nThe scaleback is most notable in prolific investors like Sequoia Capital China, which recently changed its name to HongShan after splitting off its China operation. Despite its proactive move to decouple, Sequoia still faces scrutiny from the U.S. government over its decades of activity in China. For the first three quarters this year, HongShan completed just 47 deals, compared to 99 deals in the same period of 2022, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nThe reversing turtles\n\nAs China\u2019s domestic investment appeal wanes, some investors start to look for opportunities beyond its borders. Rather than a complete departure, they are merely following the footsteps of Chinese talent who have already embarked on global expansion. (We\u2019ve covered the topic extensively here and here.)\n\nChinese startups have a long history of going abroad, and every wave has assumed its own approach. Previously, many companies would venture out only after succeeding in China. These days, more are eyeing global expansion from day one, sometimes even skipping their home market.\n\nMany in the current generation of globalizing Chinese founders have studied or worked overseas. Captivated by the Chinese internet\u2019s rapid growth, they returned home in the late 2010s to join the likes of Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and ByteDance. Having gained an insider\u2019s look into Chinese tech titans, they set out on their own entrepreneurial journey with the hope of becoming the next Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.\n\nIn China, they are called haigui, or those who \u201creturn from overseas,\u201d a homophone of \u201csea turtles.\u201d Their dreams started to crumple following the fall from grace of Ma, whose Ant Group and Alibaba became prominent targets of China\u2019s tech crackdown. They soon realized that China had entered a new era, where the regulatory hurdles for running a startup have significantly heightened.\n\nThe year 2022 saw just $14.5 billion invested in Chinese companies by U.S.-headquartered VCs, compared to $45.4 billion the year before.\n\nTo launch an AI service in China, for example, a company needs to navigate a multitude of complications, which can include obtaining a license for its large language model, seeking regulatory approval for its algorithms and implementing a costly censorship mechanism to comply with censorship requirements.\n\n\u201cYou need to pick sides. You either focus on China or go overseas, otherwise, you end up doing double the workload but with a lot less funding secured from the last two years,\u201d said one of the five China-based VCs we interviewed for the story. We also spoke to six diaspora Chinese entrepreneurs. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, all of them have asked to remain anonymous.\n\nSome ambitious, well-funded AI startups want to target both sides. To that end, they would create two entities each tailored to the Chinese and non-Chinese markets while raising capital in USD and RMB separately.\n\nNot every startup has the resources to pursue a dual-market strategy, so many \u201csea turtles\u201d wound up leaving China again. While foreign markets present their own sets of challenges \u2014 competition and skepticism toward outsiders \u2014 these entrepreneurs perceive a broader, more predictable opportunity in AI in the West. This reversal of their trajectory has earned them the moniker, guihai, or those who \u201creturn overseas.\u201d\n\nFollowing the turtles\n\nAt home, the Western-educated and -trained Chinese entrepreneurs are darlings of local VCs. In Silicon Valley, they are little known to investors. Occasional media reports that stress their Chinese background further erode trust in potential investors and customers at a time when concerns about national security already run high.\n\nEven having the Chinese branches of famed American VCs listed on the cap table might deter U.S. investors from funding Chinese founders in their backyard, three founders said. Local investors are now shunning Chinese \u201clinks,\u201d of which definition is ever evolving and broadening, at all costs to avoid geopolitical risks.\n\n\u201cIf you speak like a local, know how to pitch like a confident Silicon Valley founder, have not taken any money from Chinese VCs, have all your staff in the U.S., have generated good traction in the local market, and are working on getting a green card, you might get a chance to raise local money,\u201d said a Chinese founder based in San Francisco. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it if you still run your R&D out of China.\u201d\n\nThis financing gap presents an opportunity for the USD fund managers who are hunting beyond China\u2019s borders. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot easier to raise their first round from China\u2019s USD funds,\u201d said a former investor at one of China\u2019s top VC firms. \u201cIn some sense, the entrepreneurs are taking these investors on an international expedition.\u201d\n\nVC activity with U.S. participation in China during 2023 will hit a nine-year low, followed by a decade low in 2024.\n\nBesides the low-hanging fruit of the diaspora community, Chinese VCs flying in from Beijing and Shanghai have limited avenues to source deals in the U.S. American startups are courted by a plethora of local investors, let alone the geopolitical risks of accepting Chinese-managed money. These parachuting investors also run into competition from local investors already tailored to U.S.-China cross-border opportunities, most famously UpHonest Capital.\n\n\u201cVCs thrive on information arbitrage. In the U.S., we don\u2019t really have that same extensive network as at home,\u201d said an investor from the China arm of a global VC firm who now spends a third of their time abroad.\n\nA transitory phase\n\nVenturing out of China is not a \u201cpivot\u201d for the USD fund managers, said one of the investors we spoke to. Rather, the partners and their associates are mostly looking for something to get their hands on in the midst of a tepid market. Some are contemplating a career change, but it\u2019s difficult to find any job that matches their enviable pay.\n\n\u201cChinese VCs are most anxious about the U.S. building cars behind closed doors. They don\u2019t want to fall behind, especially given the speed AI is evolving, so they are going to the Bay Area to figure it out themselves,\u201d the investor added.\n\nThe recent influx of Chinese VCs into the Bay Area should also be viewed in a broader context. Many of these investors, who have family ties in the U.S., have been going stateside regularly for years. COVID-19, which shut down trans-Pacific flights and introduced costly and harsh quarantines, created a pent-up demand for travel. Naturally, many investors rushed to the Bay Area as soon as the borders reopened, but the surge in activity might soon start to subside, said a partner who spent the past summer in California.\n\nThere are no signs that USD funds\u2019 dealmaking in China will bounce back to its heights in the foreseeable future. The PitchBook report predicts that VC activity with U.S. participation in China during 2023 will hit a nine-year low, followed by a decade low in 2024. Many Chinese general partners have already been sourcing capital from the Middle East, which might eventually limit the impact of U.S. investors\u2019 pullback. But the question is whether Chinese tech firms, now under a new stringent regulatory regime, can deliver the same level of strong growth and returns they experienced in the previous laissez-faire era.\n\nIf the U.S. market turns out to be too challenging to penetrate due to competitive and geopolitical factors, there are still other markets to explore. Japan, known for its openness to new technologies, has been particularly popular among China\u2019s SaaS startups venturing abroad. Sniffing opportunity, China\u2019s USD fund managers, still anchored in the Middle Kingdom, will likely follow them to the neighboring country or any other market that will help hedge against uncertainties presented at home and abroad."

    "body": "Throughout September, in Tokyo, New York, Hong Kong and London, the world\u2019s biggest investment banks hosted a series of conferences for the world\u2019s biggest investors, all gravitating around the same theme: is Japan really back?\n\nAnd, according to both the attendees and hosts of those events \u2014 which were run by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Mizuho, BNP Paribas, and Jefferies \u2014 the answer is now clearer than it has been in a very long time. Japan is back, but global investors may take a little more persuasion that it is truly back for the duration.\n\nSo, this week, prime minister Fumio Kishida will make his strongest ever push for a bet on Asia\u2019s biggest advanced economy \u2014 as BlackRock founder Larry Fink, and other heads of global funds, gather in Tokyo for a series of events to attract investment.\n\n\u201cI would urge you to evaluate what we are doing in my country, look at the underlying strength of our economy and our plans for the future and then invest in Japan,\u201d Kishida said in a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nOn the face of it, the Tokyo conference guests have been told by various experts that the stars do appear aligned in Japan\u2019s favour, both on its own merits and in comparison with what is happening around it. But, because so many global funds have diverted expertise away from Japan in recent years, they are concerned that they need to know more, as a matter of urgency.\n\n\u201cThere is heightened interest in Japan after what has been, for many, a long period of not being focused on that country,\u201d says Paul Hitchens, the head of the Japan research department at Jefferies, which hosted a major investor conference in Hong Kong.\n\nJapanese prime minister Fumio Kishida will appear this week at a series of events aimed at attracting foreign investment \u00a9 AFP via Getty Images\n\nThere are distinctive catalysts for that, he adds \u2014 noting a recent push by the Tokyo Stock Exchange for companies to improve their capital efficiency, and the high profile decision of Warren Buffett to invest heavily in five of Japan\u2019s largest trading houses.\n\nHitchens says: \u201cIs there some healthy scepticism? Yes. However, global investment firms know that they need to invest and build their offerings in Japan to meet the growing appetite, and that they need to pay attention to an equity market at a 33-year high.\u201d\n\nTopix, Japan\u2019s main stock index, has risen more than 25 per cent this year, outperforming almost all the world\u2019s developed market indices and, as some conference attendees admit, creating a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on a rally that may have significantly further to go.\n\nLarge global funds are not the only ones to have had their interest in Japan piqued, says Keith Truelove, head of global markets at UBS Securities Japan.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of dry powder on the sidelines,\u201d he observes. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in Japan from family offices and from high net worth individual investors, who value wealth preservation more highly than institutional investors \u2014 it\u2019s really taking off now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey took their time to decide if it was safe to invest in Japan again, because they need to get confidence in the idea that the Japan story will be more sustainable this time,\u201d Truelove adds. He notes that Japan has offered investors a number of false-dawns over the years, and the bar for deciding that \u2018this time is different\u2019 remains high.\n\nOne of the most significant changes, say asset managers, is the fundamental shift in the way global funds now look at China. The geopolitics of US-China tensions, chip wars, decoupling and \u201cfriendshoring\u201d seem, in particular, to be working significantly in Japan\u2019s favour. Asia-focused global investment is rotating out of China and into Tokyo stocks, real estate and other assets, just as large parts of corporate Japan are engaging more actively with shareholders than at any time in the past.\n\nChina, after years of stunning growth and investor attention, is very rapidly losing that sheen. Its economy is growing more slowly and the expected post-pandemic rebound is proving elusive. On top of that, Beijing\u2019s policymaking \u2014 with its sudden crackdowns on entire industries, like video games and private tutoring, has generated a series of nasty surprises \u2014 and the unshakeable fear that others could occur at any time.\n\n\u201cYou are seeing more interest in Japan from investors, who were primarily invested in China, as China has slowed and some of its economic policies have been confusing and opaque,\u201d says Kirk Neureiter, president of Fidelity Management & Research Japan. \u201cDeployment of capital to China has been a bit more risky in terms of eventual outcome of investment decisions, given that lack of clarity.\u201d But interest in Japan has not only come about because of the push away from China, he adds.\n\nJapanese companies are increasingly aligning themselves with the interests of shareholders in a way that once seemed unlikely. Part of that, he says, is generational. Companies that replace their chief executive on five or seven year cycles now have leaders that reached their positions after the establishment of Japan\u2019s stewardship code (in 2014) and corporate governance code (2015). Many have a very different view of the role of a chief executive than their predecessors did.\n\n\u201cI think that Japan, in terms of the unifying message that companies and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are sending out, now gives a lot more confidence about where they are deploying capital,\u201d says Neureiter. \u201cSo people looking at the region are finding Japan incrementally more attractive. I\u2019ve never seen such a consensus around what needs to be done for Japanese companies to improve capital efficiency and returns on capital,\u201d he adds.\n\nEfforts by Japanese businesses to demonstrate better governance are aided by government initiatives to make Tokyo more attractive for foreign asset managers. Kishida has promised major reform of the country\u2019s $5tn asset management industry, which would ease regulations that had made it difficult for foreign and new players to enter.\n\nThe government plans to expand the Nippon Individual Savings Account (Nisa) tax-free investment scheme from next year in a bid to unlock $14tn in household financial assets that has long sat in cash and bank deposits.\n\n\u201cThis is completely different from before,\u201d says Stefanie Drews, president of Nikko Asset Management. \u201cIn the past, allocation to Japan had been tactical but this time it is strategic and that is why it is much more meaningful.\u201d"

    "body": "For Detroit, it's all about courage. For a team that was once down and out, much like their city, they are now once again on the rise. The Lions are supposed to be the kings of the jungle and hope to become the NFL's version in 2023. In terms of the food chain, a basic concept taught in science classes across the country, lions are the hunter rather than the hunted, but it's been the other way around for far too long, as 31 other teams have feasted on a once proud franchise.\n\nTheir motors have been restored and the team has been rebuilt with an attitude and moxie that would make even the most \"football guy\" of \"football guys\" blush. It's a combination of quiet confidence and a downright arrogant confidence that draws people in to root for -- or against -- an underdog.\n\nWhile the Packers have packed up the Lions for years, that all began to change in 2022. Aaron Rodgers is no longer in Green Bay, and a new love interest is now under center, Jordan Love. It was these Lions that ended the Rodgers era and swept Green Bay last season. Now they meet again in prime time on one of the league's most hallowed grounds in a battle for NFC North supremacy. The tundra won't be frozen at Lambeau Field at this point in the season, but the game sure is important, and for a game like this, there's no way we could pass up the chance to win some cash with our FanDuel single-game DFS lineup.\n\nMORE THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL:\n\nDK lineup | Best props | Betting preview | Start-Sit\n\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\n\nTNF INJURY UPDATES: Montgomery | Jones | Watson\n\nLions-Packers FanDuel Picks Week 4: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\n\nLions-Packers TNF, $60,000 budget\n\nMVP (1.5x points) QB Jared Goff, Lions ($15,500). The Lions might not be the Super Bowl contenders we thought they could be, but that doesn't mean we aren't in for a treat on Thursday night at Lambeau Field. Detroit is finding its footing in 2023 and should be able to have some success against the Packers. On the surface, Green Bay's pass defense is playing around league average, allowing 207.3 passing yards per game. That slots them in at No. 18, while Pro Football Focus grades them the No. 8 team in coverage with an 81.5. Let's look beneath the surface a little more. The Packers' first three games have come against the No. 15, 29, and 31 ranked teams in passing yards per game, or the No. 21, 29, and 32 passing offenses as graded by PFF. The Lions love to throw and have a quarterback that rarely turns it over. Goff should be in position for a solid night with his arm, lighting it up through the air against a defense that might be without their star corner, Jaire Alexander (back), again in Week 4.\n\nFLEX QB Jordan Love, Packers ($16,000). From one quarterback to another, we like this game to feature a lot of points. It's something that doesn't happen often on \"Thursday Night Football,\" but that should change this week. The Lions seem incapable of playing in low-scoring, grind-it-out games, so there will be chances for Love to get the Packers on the scoreboard often. He has seven passing touchdowns through the first three weeks and faces a bottom-10 passing defense, per PFF. Love will enjoy a date with Detroit's banged-up secondary that is just beginning life without C.J. Gardner-Johnson (pec).\n\nFLEX WR Romeo Doubs ($10,500). Christian Watson appears primed for a return on Thursday night, but does it really matter? With him being held out for multiple weeks with a hamstring injury, we question the type of workload that the former North Dakota State standout is in line for. As a result, we look to Doubs. The second-year receiver is tied for the team lead in targets and has the most touchdowns with three. Along with Jayden Reed, Doubs has been a favorite of Love's in the red zone, as the duo has combined for 12-of-16 targets to receivers. As Watson eases his way back in, it's not like Doubs will fall off a cliff in terms of production. He remains relevant with that type of connection forming.\n\nFLEX TE Sam LaPorta, Lions ($10,000). Rookie tight ends aren't typically fantasy-relevant right away, but that's where LaPorta finds himself, becoming a favorite target of Goff. He's been on an upward trajectory, starting with five targets in Week 1, six in Week 2, and 11 in Week 3. He's totaled 39, 63, and 84 yards, respectively, in those games, scoring a touchdown in the most recent contest. The Packers are a middle-of-the-road group against tight ends, but they still haven't faced one in a passing offense that lives up to LaPorta's level. On a short week with some banged-up players on offense, LaPorta should be a heavily involved security blanket.\n\nFLEX TE, Luke Musgrave ($8,000). Much like with the quarterbacks, we also like the other tight end in this game. Musgrave is coming off his best game of the season, hauling in six catches for 49 yards, and he gets a matchup against the second-worst defense against tight ends. According to FantasyPros, the Lions are giving up 14.8 fantasy points per game to the position, leaving Musgrave in a great spot to deliver. If Watson does return on Thursday, it could help the rookie, as Detroit's defense will have to focus their attention elsewhere.\n\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Lions-Packers\n\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite weekly DFS plays on SuperDraft.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\n\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\n\nHere are the most notable scoring rules for SuperDraft NFL contests: Half-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, two-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\n\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\n\nChampion (+50% points): WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions (Multiplier 1.5x)\n\nSuper FLEX: QB Jared Goff, Lions (Multiplier 1.1x)\n\nSuper FLEX: RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions (Multiplier 1.2x)\n\nSuper FLEX: QB Jordan Love, Packers (Multiplier 1.15x)\n\nSuper FLEX: RB Aaron Jones, Packers (Multiplier 1.1x)\n\nLast week was all about defense. This week is all about offense. The Lions feature a potent offense that's three-headed monster of Goff, St. Brown, and Gibbs should be able to produce. On the Green Bay side of things, Love will hopefully have his top option back in the backfield and that duo cooked the Bears defense in the opener. If Jones is healthy and suits up, then he's a must-have in your roster after the clunkers that AJ Dillon has posted for the last two weeks. Otherwise, pivot to a pass-catcher."

    "body": "An anxious wait, then complete heartbreak. No one could question the effort, the heart or the drive of Sarina Wiegman\u2019s Lionesses in this game, but scoring six goals against Scotland was not enough to close the goal difference gap on the Netherlands, because the Dutch scored a fourth against Belgium deep in added time to secure top spot and progress from their Nations League group ahead of England.\n\nIt was an extraordinary mountain and a Lauren James masterclass and gut-busting display from Lucy Bronze were not enough to lift them to the summit. The damage had been done in the preceding games, two poor goals conceded against the Dutch at Wembley, a 3-2 defeat in Belgium in October and a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in September, will be full of regrets. However, there will be what\u2011ifs either way, the first goal conceded in Utrecht appearing offside in the buildup.\n\nIt meant a back and forth of goals scored by England against Scotland and the Netherlands in their win over Belgium was necessary in the final round of fixtures. A showdown.\n\nThere will be questions about Scotland\u2019s efforts, a defensive collapse at Hampden Park almost helping England towards earning a place for Team GB at the Paris Olympics, but that would be unfair. The gulf in class between the European champions, ranked fourth in the world, and their neighbours to the north, ranked 23rd, is clear and the manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, has been unconvincing in charge.\n\nThere were two changes to the England side that came from two goals down to earn Friday\u2019s late 3-2 win against the Netherlands that had kept hopes of progression alive. Beth Mead was returned to the starting lineup for the first time since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury just over a year ago, having proved her worth coming off the bench at half-time against the Dutch to insert some directness into England\u2019s play, and Esme Morgan replaced Jess Carter.\n\nMart\u00ednez Losa swapped four players from the side that earned a 1-1 draw with Belgium on Friday, with Lee Alexander notably replacing the former England international Sandy MacIver in goal.\n\nLauren James scores England\u2019s third goal in their emphatic win. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nWiegman had urged her players to \u201cgo wild from the first minute\u201d against Scotland, cautioning \u201cbut you don\u2019t want to get erratic\u201d and England came out of the blocks searching for an early goal that would assert their authority on the tie. If there was any doubt about Scotland\u2019s intentions against England, with Bronze calling accusations that Scotland players might feel conflicted with the possibility of Olympic qualification on the line for them as much as for England \u201cthe rudest thing I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d and Scotland\u2019s captain, Rachel Corsie, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d those were put to bed, temporarily at least, in the opening three minutes, with Bronze clattered into late twice as Scotland looked to make an early impression.\n\nIf England had played well for the opening 10 minutes against the Dutch only to be sucker-punched on the counter in the 12th minute, against Scotland there was no risk of that. Instead, the visiting team took the lead to swing the pressure on to the Dutch, Mead\u2019s corner sent in by an unmarked Greenwood.\n\nMoments later Lisa Evans was down in the box under pressure from Bronze but appeals for a penalty were waved away with the right-back having not caught the forwards legs.\n\nThat rare foray forward was urged on by a vocal Scotland crowd, in which interesting conversations could be heard. After Lauren Hemp raced free on the right a hopeful \u201cCome on Lauren\u201d was met with a thick, cheery Scottish \u201cShut up!\u201d behind the press box.\n\nIf it was friendly in the stands it was far less so on the pitch. England went close to a second, with the Dutch having taken the lead against Belgium, when James weaved into the box before delivering to Hemp at the far post who lashed her effort off the base of a post from close range.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mead\u2019s corner was cleared and sent back in by the Arsenal forward only to be cleared again. But while England players appealed for handball, James sent the ball goalward and it took a heavy deflection that wrongfooted Alexander and flew in.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty, but England were clawing away at the goal difference gap. A minute later James delivered in more characteristic style, curling a wonderful effort into the top corner from the edge of the area.\n\nIn added time at the end of the half, James turned provider of the goal that put England top of the group once more, sweeping a cross to Mead at the far post for the forward to bring down and fire past a helpless Alexander.\n\nThe goal that gave England a cushion came shortly after the restart, Georgia Stanway beating Corsie to the byline before sending the ball into the middle for Fran Kirby to turn in from close range. The breathing room didn\u2019t last long, though, with the Netherlands scoring once more.\n\nThere was almost disaster for England when Earps failed to collect from the feet of Kirsty Hanson, but the Scotland forward sent her effort wide of the empty net with the angle closing.\n\nAn added-time save of a header from the substitute Martha Thomas at full stretch by Mary Earps kept England in it. The Netherlands having scored in the 91st minute, Bronze\u2019s powering header meant England were back in for two minutes, until they were out, the Dutch scoring in the 95th minute to crush the Lionesses while they stood in a huddle waiting for news of the other game\u2019s result, the pain sweeping across their faces as it came through."

    "body": "Your time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nThe streaming landscape is vast and hard to keep track of. TV shows pop up (and get canceled) seemingly overnight, and even if you\u2019re in a place where you\u2019re looking for a new show to sink hours into, it can be overwhelming to make the right choice.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re going to keep this post updated with the most recent series on each of the major streaming platforms that we liked, as well as some other options if our pick doesn\u2019t sound like your particular jam.\n\nSo, below, find the best new shows on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Max, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Apple TV, and Peacock. Our latest update added Castlevania: Nocturne, Gen V, Hijack, and The Continental.\n\nThe best new shows on Netflix\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nCreator: Clive Bradley\n\nCast: Edward Bluemel, Thuso Mbedu, Pixie Davies\n\nTo say that the follow-up to Netflix\u2019s Castlevania had a lot to live up to would be an understatement. Based on Konami\u2019s acclaimed action-adventure game series and produced by Texas-based Powerhouse Animation Studios, the original 32-episode adult animated series was an unmistakable success for the streamer when it premiered in 2017. Chronicling the adventures of Trevor Belmont, the last surviving descendant of a long line of monster hunters, and Sypha, a powerful magic wielder hailing from a reclusive tribe of magicians, the series followed the pair as they joined forces with Alucard, half-human son of Dracula, to slay his vengeful father and save humanity from the threat of extinction.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne picks up three centuries after the original, and while Trevor and Sypha may be dead, their legacy lives on in the series\u2019 new protagonist, Richter Belmont. Set amid the French Revolution, Nocturne follows Richter as he is enlisted by a young sorceress named Annette to fight against a conspiracy of aristocrats who have allied themselves with a powerful enemy known as the Vampire Messiah. Haunted by the death of his mother at the hands of a mysterious vampire named Olrox, Richter must call upon every ounce of his courage to face this new darkness and assume his birthright as a Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne is a terrific installment in the franchise that meets and exceeds the original Castlevania at its best. From its brilliantly realized character designs and exhilarating action sequences to its beautiful score and nuanced take on real-life revolutions, the series is both an excellent continuation and fantastic entry point for new audiences. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nAlso good: The Diplomat, a light, plot-heavy political thriller starring Keri Russell; The Night Agent, a fun popcorn spy thriller from The Shield\u2019s Shawn Ryan; Physical 100, a brilliant and brutal competition show; Ganglands, a visceral French crime thriller; Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the anime from CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger; The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House, a food-centric drama from master filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda; Derry Girls, the hilarious comedy set against the backdrop of the Troubles; and The Sandman, the live-action adaptation of the DC Comics fantasy horror series by Neil Gaiman.\n\nThe best new show on Hulu\n\nReservation Dogs\n\nCreator: Sterlin Harjo\n\nCast: Devery Jacobs, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Lane Factor\n\nReservation Dogs was a wonderful thing \u2014 a show about misfits living on a reservation in Oklahoma who want nothing more than to get far the hell away\u2026 until that far-the-hell-away becomes actually tangible. While Taika Waititi produces the show, it is blissfully removed from his particular (and for me, very tiring) brand of humor, instead shining through award-winning filmmaker Sterlin Harjo and a dynamic cast of main characters and featured guests (the second season included a memorable guest appearance by Prey star Amber Midthunder, and the legendary Gary Farmer and Wes Studi have hilarious recurring roles). The third season wrapped the show up on its terms, leaving an indelible mark on television and the culture at large. \u2014PV\n\nAlso good: Love Island UK, the reality dating show, What We Do in the Shadows, the hilarious TV adaptation of the modern-day vampire mockumentary, and the final season of Atlanta, the \u201cTwin Peaks for rappers\u201d comedy drama starring (and created by) Donald Glover.\n\nThe best new TV on Prime Video\n\nGen V\n\nShowrunners: Michele Fazekas, Tara Butters\n\nCast: Jaz Sinclair, Chance Perdomo, Lizze Broadway\n\nBecoming a superhero is hard. This is an established principle \u2014 those origin stories aren\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows! \u2014 but it\u2019s doubly true in the universe of The Boys, where Gen V takes place. This is a world where your powers manifest with your first period and then kill your mom, as happened to Marie (Jaz Sinclair). She eventually winds up at Godolkin University, the only university for supes in particular, and \u2014 well, it\u2019s the land of Vought International and The Boys. Trouble ensues from there.\n\nWhat makes Gen V so compelling is how deftly it weaves together its themes. The (latest) conspiracy smoothly brings Marie and her cohort together, leapfrogging tropes and letting the story flow. Gen V manages to do the impossible: Make superhero TV feel like more than a collection of origin story tropes, and let its characters feel very grounded and like people. It\u2019s The Boys, so you know you\u2019re in for a giant dick or a puppet massacre, but it\u2019s worth that buy-in to see just how well Gen V makes its grade. \u2014Zosha Millman\n\nAlso good: A League of Their Own, an adaptation of the sports movie classic unfortunately canceled after just one season; Paper Girls, a sci-fi coming-of-age comic adaptation also unfortunately canceled after one season; and Reacher, a detective series that asks the important question, \u201cWhat if Sherlock Holmes was absolutely massive?\u201d\n\nThe best new TV on Max\n\nUnicorn: Warriors Eternal\n\nCreators: Genndy Tartakovsky, Darrick Bachman\n\nCast: Hazel Doupe, Demari Hunte, Tom Milligan, Paul Tylak\n\nGenndy Tartakovsky is a name that needs no introduction among animation fans. The creator of such well-known and beloved series as Dexter\u2019s Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Primal, and more, Tartakovsky is known for his imaginative worlds populated with eccentric and memorable characters. Unicorn: Warriors Eternal is the director-animator\u2019s latest masterpiece; a fantasy action series over two decades in the making that follows a group of immortal heroes who are reincarnated across time and space to do battle against an ancient evil. The series combines several of Tartakovsky\u2019s most passionate interests \u2014 the science-fiction of Osamu Tezuka\u2019s Astro Boy, the steampunk-adjacent Victorian settings of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s work, the idiosyncratic character designs of Popeye creator E. C. Segar \u2014 to create an experience that feels unlike anything else on television in 2023, animated or otherwise. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nAlso good: My Adventures with Superman, the slice-of-life action series based on the DC Comics superhero, Full Circle, Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s miniseries loosely based on Akira Kurosawa\u2019s High and Low, Danny McBride\u2019s rapturously funny The Righteous Gemstones, and Harley Quinn, which is currently airing its fourth season.\n\nThe best new TV on Disney Plus\n\nAndor\n\nCreator: Tony Gilroy\n\nCast: Diego Luna, Kyle Soller, Adria Arjona\n\nAside from being one of the best Star Wars shows to date, Andor has the enviable distinction of holding the No. 1 spot on our list of the best shows of 2022. Either of those two facts alone warrants the show\u2019s inclusion on this list, but combined, that well-earned place feels all but mandatory. Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) returns to the Star Wars after his turn as co-screenwriter on 2016\u2019s Rogue One, diving into an origin story of the eponymous Rebel captain that also functions as an origin story of the Rebel Alliance itself. The series meticulously moves away from the rote, Easter egg-laden iconography for which many Star Wars fans typically associate the franchise with and substitutes it with down-to-earth aesthetic and tone that treats the stakes of its universe as seriously as the underdogs who occupy it.\n\nDiego Luna, much like his character, Cassian Andor, is the perfect leading man for the job, while Stellan S\u200b\u200bkarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s supporting performance as the cunning rebellion ringleader Luthen Rael has quickly asserted itself as one of the best characters to come out of Star Wars since Disney acquired the property in 2012. It takes three or so episodes to shift into full gear, but once it does, it\u2019s a exhilarating journey you\u2019ll want to see through to the end. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nAlso good: Willow, the TV revival of the 1988 fantasy adventure.\n\nThe best new TV on Paramount Plus\n\nThe Good Fight\n\nCreators: Robert and Michelle King\n\nCast: Christine Baranski, Audra McDonald, a rotating cast of your favorite actors on TV\n\nOne of the initial promises of streaming television was that it would bring us the kind of shows that were not possible on more traditional broadcast or cable networks. In practice, this hasn\u2019t actually amounted to much more than bloated episode length and the occasional one-off experiment, like Arrested Development season 4 or Netflix\u2019s choose-your-own heist show Kaleidoscope.\n\nThe Good Fight, however, was different. The show opened its first season in 2017 with a very clear mission statement, as Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a character from series predecessor The Good Wife, prepares to leave her cushy job as partner at a law firm to become a fashionable expat in Italy after the election of Donald Trump. Unfortunately for her, she loses her nest egg when her money is tied up in a Ponzi scheme, and is forced to go back to work \u2014 not at her old, majority-white firm, but at Chicago\u2019s largest Black law firm.\n\nWith this setup, The Good Fight endeavored to tell the story of Trump-era America as it was written, and while it had its blind spots, it often did a better job of it than most cable news networks, telling unflinching stories about race in America, right-wing internet trolls, and the outrage economy that drives culture wars. But it was also one of the most inventive shows on television \u2014 any given episode could have animated musical segments explaining geopolitics, stories about a secret court that Mandy Patinkin runs like a game show, or a cutaway gag ruminating on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein had his penis frozen for preservation. In this, it was the Star Trek of legal dramas, always different, full of ideas, and gloriously messy. \u2014Joshua Rivera\n\nAlso good: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, the best of a stellar crop of new Star Trek shows.\n\nThe best new TV on Apple TV Plus\n\nHijack\n\nCreators: George Kay, Jim Field Smith\n\nCast: Idris Elba, Neil Maskell, Archie Panjabi\n\nHijack is almost exactly what it sounds like: It\u2019s about a hijacking. But that simplicity of premise belies a much richer, much more fun story, something that reads much more like a breezy blockbuster thriller of yore than another drop in the streaming TV bucket. Comparing TV to movies can be seen as derogatory, suggesting a show lacks the pacing of quality television, but here it just serves to highlight how effectively Hijack is doing what it\u2019s doing. This is a show that knows what it\u2019s about.\n\nAs does Sam Nelson (Idris Elba), one of the many passengers just trying to make it home when his plane gets suddenly hijacked by a group of terrorists. Without arousing suspicion from the gunmen closely watching the plane, Sam and his fellow travelers have to figure out how to secure the plane and get everyone home safely.\n\nHijack is taut, making every moment count, even in ways you don\u2019t expect. Little details that feel brushed past are returned to, and things that first seem like plot holes get filled in, exploited by the passengers or the hijackers. And it\u2019s told in close to real time, with every minute and every decision made by those on the plane (and on the ground, as British law enforcement mobilizes to help on their end). It\u2019s twisty, it\u2019s neat, and it involves Idris Elba ducking around a plane \u2014 something Elba said he had to really do, since he is very tall and they filmed in an actual plane. In a world drowning in watchlists that grow larger by the day, Hijack is a breath of fresh air: easy, competent, and just a pure pleasure. \u2014ZM\n\nAlso good: Severance, a stark science fiction take on the modern workplace; Slow Horses, a British spy drama about a bunch of losers (including Gary Oldman) who would like a win.\n\nThe best new TV on Peacock\n\nThe Continental: From the World of John Wick\n\nCreators: Greg Coolidge, Kirk Ward, Shawn Simmons\n\nCast: Colin Woodell, Mishel Prada, Hubert Point-Du Jour\n\nI entered The Continental warily. The world of John Wick didn\u2019t exactly need a prequel series, and it was hard to imagine a television show could come anywhere close to matching the exhilarating highs of the movies\u2019 action sequences.\n\nBut early on, one thing gave me hope: The hiring of action legend Larnell Stovall to lead the show\u2019s fight sequences. And boy, did Stovall and his team deliver: From the show\u2019s opening heist sequence to the incredible rooftop fight in the third episode, The Continental delivers reliable bangers throughout its three-episode run. The show smartly avoids becoming too loyal to the movies\u2019 visual style \u2014 something the miniseries could never accurately mimic on a more limited budget. Instead, The Continental leans into action appropriate for the era it is set in, and builds surprisingly strong characters and relationships in our brief time at the hotel. \u2014PV\n\nAlso good: Poker Face, Rian Johnson\u2019s inverted detective series starring Natasha Lyonne; Grand Crew, a sitcom about Black wine aficionados; Girls5Eva, a hilarious comedy about a girl group getting back together; The Resort, a dark mystery-comedy starring William Jackson Harper (The Good Place) and Cristin Milioti (Made for Love) as a couple on vacation who stumble across a deadly mystery."

    "body": "Oct 8, 2023; Concord, North Carolina, USA; Cars crowd into turn four after a restart during the Bank of America Roval 400 at Charlotte Motor Speedway Road Course. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThere is no denying how the new media rights deal has stunned the NASCAR community. With many still trying to digest it, the deal has undoubtedly given rise to divided opinions. While the figure of $7.7 billion sounds lucrative, there seems to be more to it than what meets the eye.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nIt is public knowledge that NASCAR officials invested plenty of time in negotiating the media rights deal. To secure an average annual revenue of $1.1 billion is something, especially when the sport is supposedly on the wane. However, it looks like the sanctioning body has made it count when it mattered the most.\n\nIs the new media rights deal a game-changer for NASCAR?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nJust a couple of days back, NASCAR finalized a $7.7 billion deal with Fox Sports, NBC, Amazon, and Warner Bros. Discovery. With such a lucrative deal securing seven years of revenue, surely it seems like a lot of money. But is that really the case?\n\nNASCAR secured almost a 40% increase over their current media rights deal yet there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit perfectly. Sports Business Journal journalist Adam Stern recently cleared a few things out when he attended the Dirty Mo Live podcast. With the Cup Series already facing a 5% drop in viewership this year, Stern discussed how the new deal could impact the ratings.\n\nAt first, the renowned journalist explained how the sanctioning body would have loved to stay with Fox Sports and NBC. However, given that it would have most likely resulted in less money, NASCAR opted to explore other options. Stern then pointed out how the media rights revenue plays a key role in sports as he used the MLS as an example.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou look at MLS. MLS takes a big deal with Apple, almost all of their games behind the Apple TV\u2019s paywall. That was the money they could get and they had to deliver for their industry. Their industry is expected to be a growing business and one of the most sporting ways to be a growing business in sports is to have growing media rights revenue.\u201d\n\nWhile he explained that it was a similar case with NASCAR, he added one more angle because of which this deal possibly materialized. It is no secret that the cable universe has been declining. As Stern discussed, every quarter, there is a drop in a couple of percentages of subscribers, which is very concerning.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why NASCAR did not want to gamble solely on cable users. With Amazon Prime, they had the leisure to explore the streaming arena and possibly get a glimpse of how it could look in the future. However, along with that, there was a major reason behind the deal.\n\nAs Stern said, \u201cSo partially, they [NASCAR] did it to spread their eggs in multiple baskets but also part out of it was to get more money and to make sure they get more money in the industry at the time when their teams are saying we need more money, we are not profitable currently.\u201d\n\nWATCH THIS STORY: NASCAR\u2019s Charter Conundrum: A Twist in the Tale?\n\nThe SBJ journalist then explained that NASCAR was more or less left with no choice when it came to this deal. He said, \u201cNASCAR is in a tough situation because they had to deliver more money as well and clearly if they went this route, that\u2019s a good indication that\u2019s because they had to go this route to deliver more money for the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile NASCAR secured an impressive deal, there could be downsides to it and Stern explained it beautifully.\n\nAdam Stern points out a key potential drawback with NASCAR\u2019s new media rights deal\n\nSafe to say, NASCAR has been struggling to keep their teams happy in terms of profitability. Since the introduction of the Next Gen cars, it has only become more difficult for the Cup Series teams and teams in other competitions. While they have taken a commercial hit, they have piled up pressure on NASCAR to help out in this case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nIn addition to that, Sports Business Journalist Adam Stern detailed one important issue with the new media rights deal. Speaking on the same podcast, he said, \u201cWhen you look at the deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, those races are going to be simulcast not just on MAX streaming but also on TNT and TNT is cable, not a free-to-air channel.\u201d\n\nStern continued explaining how it can come back to haunt. He said, \u201cYou have that on the cable subscription. So, the number of races that are going down that have been on the network, that\u2019s what teams are concerned about because the ratings will probably be lower.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWith not every fan having access to all platforms, it is a tricky situation both for the fans and NASCAR. However, the sanctioning body has gone ahead and made its move with the new media rights deal. Now, it remains to be seen how the execution part works out. For now, it looks like NASCAR has secured itself well by bringing more money to the table.\n\nKyle Larson Believes NASCAR\u2019s Multi-Billion Dollar Media Rights Deal Is a Step in the Right Direction Despite Fans\u2019 Backlash"

    "body": "Amazon\u2019s Echo devices will now allow kids to have interactive conversations with an AI-powered Alexa via a new feature called \u201cExplore with Alexa.\u201d First announced in September, the addition to the Amazon Kids+ content subscription allows children to have kid-friendly conversations with Alexa, powered by generative AI, but in a protected fashion designed to ensure the experience remains safe and appropriate.\n\nThough there are already some AI experiences that cater to younger users, like the AI chatbots from Character.ai and other companies, including Meta, Amazon is among the first to specifically look to generative AI to develop a conversational experience for kids under the age of 13.\n\nThat also comes with constraints, however, as generative AI can be led astray or \u201challucinate\u201d answers, while kids could ask inappropriate questions. To address these potential problems, Amazon has put guardrails into place around its use of gen AI for kids.\n\nFor starters, the Alexa Kids science team narrowed down the new experience, which leverages Alexa\u2019s LLM (large language model) technology, to include only kid-friendly fun facts and trivia questions. Initially, the content will come from just two partners, the World Wildlife Fund and A-Z animals. In time, the team would like to expand the AI to include other areas of interest to kids, like space, music, video games and sports.\n\nIn addition, and perhaps most importantly, the generative AI experience is not happening in real time on the device.\n\n\u201cWe want to go slow and be intentional and be measured with how we\u2019re introducing this new tech, as well as any new tech for kids, which is why we\u2019re not just hooking the experience up to an LLM at runtime and kind of letting kids go at it,\u201d explains Arjun Venkataswamy, senior product manager for Alexa Kids, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe way that we\u2019ve integrated an LLM here is we use it to generate content at scale offline, and then go through a review process that includes both humans, as well as AI, and then take that reviewed content and then put it into our experience,\u201d he says.\n\nIn other words, kids aren\u2019t using generative AI on the fly when conversing with Alexa, and the content is pre-reviewed and comes from a small dataset of just animal facts and sources.\n\nHowever, because the AI can generate tens of thousands of potential responses, not every answer can be reviewed by a human before being added to the experience. To that end, Amazon is also using AI to help it review the materials it\u2019s using for \u201cExplore with Alexa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat our AI is doing is taking trusted content and then figuring out what\u2019s fun, looking at what\u2019s fun, turning them into a trivia question \u2014 so it is doing useful things for us at scale that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do without this tooling\u2026but we feel really good about the safety guardrails that are in place right now in terms of content,\u201d says Venkataswamy.\n\nTo access the new experience, kids can trigger the AI-generated facts or trivia in one of two ways. They can either utter a particular phrase that kicks off \u201cExplore with Alexa,\u201d like \u201cAlexa, let\u2019s explore animals\u201d or \u201cAlexa, tell me an animal fact.\u201d But the more interesting way to use this feature is to have kids engage in organic conversations with Alexa where this topic could come up. For instance, a kid might ask \u201cWhat does a lion\u2019s roar sound like?\u201d or \u201cHow fast can a cheetah run?\u201d This would also allow kids to enter the more conversational Q&A experience.\n\nPlus, over the next few months, Alexa will also prompt kids on some occasions, asking if they want to hear something interesting about animals.\n\nUnlike more traditional conversations with Alexa, the AI experience works two ways. That is, it\u2019s not just kids asking Alexa a question and receiving a response.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we think is really cool about this paradigm is kids aren\u2019t just asking Alexa questions and getting the answers \u2014 Alexa is now asking kids questions,\u201d says Venkataswamy. That is, Alexa could ask the kids a trivia question like \u201cWhat\u2019s the fastest animal on Earth?\u201d\n\nAs any teacher will tell you, by having the kids try to think of the answer first, the answer will stick in their minds better when they hear the response.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s, it\u2019s narrow. Alexa is asking kids trivia questions,\u201d Venkataswamy continues. \u201cBut we want to continue expanding on that and making it more interactive.\u201d\n\nEventually, Amazon wants to have this generative AI experience integrated at runtime for both kids and adults, but it knows it needs to proceed carefully, especially with the former.\n\n\u201cWe do want to integrate an LLM in runtime in a more protected way than we would integrate it for adults\u2026However, this approach lets us iterate and figure out the right ways to get both safe and delightful content outputted from the LLM for kids,\u201d says Venkataswamy.\n\nAmazon is also preparing to launch an AI-powered \u201cLet\u2019s Chat\u201d Alexa experience for adults later this year, he says.\n\nIn terms of privacy, the company notes it\u2019s not training its LLM on kids\u2019 answers. In addition, the \u201cExplore with Alexa\u201d experience and any future LLM-backed features will continue to follow the same data handling policies of \u201cclassic Alexa\u201d (non-AI Alexa). That means the Alexa app will include a list of the questions asked by kids in the household (those with a kids\u2019 profile) and the response Alexa provided. That history can be stored or deleted either manually or automatically, depending on your settings.\n\nAlongside the launch of \u201cExplore with Alexa,\u201d the new Echo Pop Kids speakers will also now be available for purchase, starting at $49.99 in the U.S.\n\nThe Echo Pop Kids will come in two new designs: Marvel\u2019s Avengers and Disney Princess, which feature corresponding character themes. Kids can use the devices to hear a greeting, fun fact or joke about an Avenger or Disney Princess, in keeping with the theme. Both also include six months of access to the Amazon Kids+ subscription service, which, in addition to \u201cExplore with Alexa,\u201d also offers a range of kid-friendly games, apps, books, videos and more, including custom Alexa themes.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t need a specific \u201cKids\u201d device to use \u201cExplore with Alexa.\u201d The feature works on any device set to kids mode or any communal family device, if parents have set up their kids\u2019 voice ID.\n\nInitially, \u201cExplore with Alexa\u201d will be available in English only but internationalization is further down the road.\n\nIt\u2019s harder for Amazon to estimate when such an AI feature will become available at runtime for kids, though.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a timeline, because we don\u2019t have a concrete answer for what exactly we\u2019re going to be doing yet, although we do have plans and experiments we\u2019re planning to look into,\u201d Venkataswamy says. \u201cI will say that in terms of our criteria for when we\u2019re going to get there, we\u2019re working closely with the Family Trust team at Amazon that\u2019s connected to a variety of research institutions in the U.S\u2026we want to be able to get some confidence from external partners that our approach is right,\u201d he adds."

How we tested the TikTok pixel We downloaded a Chrome extension called Omnibug, which is used to test marketing and analytics tools.\n\nWith the extension installed, we visited websites such as Sportsbet, Kmart, Beyond Blue and many others.\n\nWe went to sign up for an account on those websites, entering personal information including our full name, email address, phone number.\n\nUsing Omnibug, we could see in real time that information being sent back to TikTok, often before clicking \u201cI consent\u201d to the website\u2019s privacy policy. TikTok uses a tool called \u201cautomatic advanced matching\u201d that sees when a user enters text into a form field or a search box, and if it looks like an email address or phone number, it scrapes that data.\n\nSimilar data is sent to Google and Meta, but only after \u201cI consent\u201d, for example, has been ticked. \u201cWhen The Age and Sydney Morning Herald alerted us to this issue, we immediately commenced a review of our privacy policy and removed the TikTok pixel from our website. Our investigations are continuing as a priority. \u201cLike many health organisations, Beyond Blue uses tools such as pixels to help us deliver safe and relevant content to people online.\u201d\n\nA Sportsbet spokesman said: \u201cWe use advanced matching, and that\u2019s consistent with targeting advertising methods that a lot of companies use. Our understanding is they don\u2019t decrypt or use hashed data that has been shared with them.\u201d Loading Kmart did not respond to requests for comment. The tests by this masthead found that for Google and Meta\u2019s tracking pixels, email addresses and phone numbers were sent to Google and Meta only after a user had consented to the websites\u2019 privacy policies. According to TikTok\u2019s website, the tracking pixel can \u201chelp you find new customers, optimise your campaigns and measure ad performance\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith the pixel, you can track website visitor actions, like view page or purchase, and create audience segments to re-engage previous site visitors or model lookalikes to find new customers,\u201d TikTok says on its website. TikTok has rejected claims the pixel breaches Australia\u2019s privacy laws. Credit: AP \u2018Remove that pixel\u2019 The extent of data collected by TikTok\u2019s pixel without user consent has caused concern among Australian marketers. Marketing and advisory agency Civic Data has issued a warning to its clients recommending they remove the pixel from their websites on privacy grounds. In the client bulletin on December 20, which was obtained by this masthead, Civic Data director Chris Brinkworth said his company had \u201crepeatedly observed non-consensual collection of personal data on Australian wagering, telco, finance, supermarket, e-commerce, charity and media organisations\u2019 websites.\n\nLoading \u201cThis raises serious privacy concerns regarding the lack of transparency, misuse of personal information and disregard for consent requirements under current regulations such as the Privacy Act 1988. Civic Data\u2019s recommendation is that all Australian businesses consider removing the TikTok pixel and other TikTok integrations from their platforms if they cannot guarantee that the data usage matches the consent given by consumers.\u201d Civic Data\u2019s clients include accounting software company Xero, Ticketek, Carsales, RACV and BlueScope. Call to protect Australians Senator James Paterson has called for an urgent probe by Australia\u2019s information commissioner.\n\nPaterson, the Coalition\u2019s cybersecurity spokesman, this year chaired a committee into foreign interference through social media that grilled TikTok executives. \u201cThis is a very serious and potentially unlawful mass breach of the privacy of TikTok users, former users and non-users,\u201d he told this masthead. Senator James Paterson has called for an urgent probe by Australia\u2019s information commissioner. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen \u201cIt would be concerning from any company but is particularly alarming given TikTok is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party and has admitted its China-based employees frequently access Australian user data. There\u2019s nothing to stop this industrial-scale unauthorised data collection being simply handed over to Chinese intelligence and security agencies, as TikTok and its employees are obliged to do under Article 7 of China\u2019s National Intelligence Law. \u201cThe information commissioner must commence an urgent investigation into TikTok Australia and use their full range of enforcement powers to protect Australians from this extraordinary surveillance.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said the agency was monitoring issues relating to TikTok\u2019s handling of personal information, particularly in light of the findings made by the British Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in an investigation into the company. Loading \u201cThe OAIC will give consideration to the information raised which alleges data scraping in regard to TikTok\u2019s practices,\u201d the spokesman said. A TikTok spokeswoman denied the pixel breaches Australia\u2019s privacy laws. \u201cWe strongly reject the suggestions outlined by Civic Data and are disappointed that a company would deliberately try to mislead or scare companies without regard to current law or the information available,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPixel usage, which is voluntary for our advertising clients to adopt, is an industry-wide tool used to improve the effectiveness of advertising services. Our use of this tool is compliant with all current Australian privacy laws and regulations, and we dismiss any suggestion otherwise.\u201d The China connection In 2016, China designated big data a \u201cfundamental strategic resource\u201d, and four years later its government designated data as the fifth \u201cfactor of production\u201d, joining land, labour, capital and technology. Its national intelligence laws allow the ruling Communist Party to pull data upon request from companies based in the nation. China\u2019s National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires all organisations and citizens to \u201csupport, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work\u201d, and the Australian government this year banned TikTok on government devices over security concerns related to China\u2019s intelligence laws. Governments from Britain, Canada, France and New Zealand have also banned the app from official devices.\n\nJocelinn Kang, technical specialist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said data from a tracking pixel could be aggregated across websites, apps and social media platforms. She said pixel tracking could identify users through their \u201cbrowser fingerprint\u201d \u2013 a combination of their IP address, browser and system details. Chinese President Xi Jinping. China\u2019s national intelligence laws allow the government to pull data upon request from companies based there. Credit: Reuters \u201cHowever, when more identifying data such as email and phone number is associated with a user, their web activity can be better linked,\u201d Kang said. Strategic Policy Institute researcher Samantha Hoffman said the data collected by TikTok\u2019s pixel was similar to that of US-based tech giants Google and Meta, but the difference was \u201cthe intent\u201d.\n\nAdvertising data had \u201cincredible propaganda value\u201d, she said. Loading \u201cIf you think about that, plus the access that TikTok is required to give the Chinese government, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d In November 2022, TikTok changed its privacy policy to make it explicitly clear user data can be accessed by some employees from across the world, including China. \u201cThey talk about how even data collected overseas can be used by the company and its partners, and would be kept private unless security organisations make demands of it,\u201d Hoffman said."

    "body": "Part of / We only get one planet\n\nTires are the most important safety component on a car, yet there\u2019s increasing research that they\u2019re doing a good deal of harm, too. Slowly, surely, one mote of black dust at a time, tires are leaving their mark on the environment.\n\nAccording to researchers at Imperial College London, our cars and trucks emit 6 million tons of tire wear particles every year, transportation detritus that goes into the air, the land, and the water. That\u2019s a massive figure that ignores the nearly 250 million tires that are disposed of annually in North America, roughly half of which are burned.\n\nIt\u2019s a depressing state of affairs, but there is room for optimism. Every major tire manufacturer globally is raising its game \u2014 not only in terms of performance in the face of bigger, heavier electric cars but also in terms of environmental impact. Renewable materials are finding their way into modern tires, and there\u2019s even greener rubber on the horizon, too.\n\nTruly sustainable tires are becoming a reality, but will it be enough?\n\nRenewable rubber\n\nBridgestone\u2019s \u201cWireless-In-Wheel\u201d technology.\n\nIf you watched any IndyCar road course race this year, basically any of the half-dozen events where the drivers had to turn right as well as left, you might have noticed some green flashes on those cars\u2019 tires. It wasn\u2019t just a visual flair to an otherwise visually dull part of the equation.\n\nThose tires contained guayule, part of an agrarian prototype effort from Bridgestone, the supplier of spec tires for that series. It\u2019s a high-profile demonstration of a new domestically sourced, renewable source of rubber that augments other natural sources like that from the hevea tree and even the Russian dandelion.\n\nTruly sustainable tires are becoming a reality, but will it be enough?\n\nBridgestone\u2019s Bill Niaura, executive director of sustainable innovation and circular economy, says guayule is a drop-in replacement with many potential advantages. Chief among them? Location: \u201cHevea trees are primarily grown in Southeast Asia,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile guayule is grown in the Southwestern US.\u201d\n\nThis is also a climate resiliency play. Guayule provides an alternate drought-resistant source for natural rubber at a time when global temperature patterns are behaving like the stock market: highly unpredictable but trending upward.\n\nVirtually every tire manufacturer is making at least token efforts to increase the usage of sustainable materials like guayule. Yokohama is using motorsports to develop its Advan A005 tire, which debuted at last year\u2019s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb and contains 33 percent sustainable materials, including biomass-derived rubber. Michelin, meanwhile, shod Porsche\u2019s prototype electric GT4 e-Performance racer with tires said to be 53 percent renewable, like strap steel and lemon peels.\n\nThat all may sound like marketing plays \u2014 and it partly is \u2014 but motorsports have historically proven an ideal development opportunity in the automotive industry. Track tires are pushed to their limits, resulting in better products for the road. In time, at least.\n\nMany manufacturers have a self-imposed deadline for a shift to renewable sourcing for materials. Dunlop is promising 40 percent of its tires will be renewable by the end of this decade and 100 percent by 2050. Bridgestone\u2019s goal is also 2050 but is introducing models now with an increased focus on sustainability, like the Turanza EV, made of 50 percent renewable and recycled materials.\n\nHow all of this factors into each manufacturer\u2019s specialty blends is complicated, but generally, it breaks down like this:\n\n\u201cNatural rubber and synthetic rubber each represent about 25 percent of materials used in tire manufacturing. Fillers, primarily carbon black and silica, represent an additional 25 percent,\u201d Bridgestone\u2019s Niaura says. \u201cThe remaining percentage consists of steel, textiles, oils, resins, and other ingredients used to cure the tire or serve as anti-degradants.\u201d\n\nBy blending different components, manufacturers can adjust a tire\u2019s grip (how sticky it is), tread life (how long it lasts), and rolling resistance (how efficient it will make your car). High-grip tires are traditionally short-lived and inefficient, but thanks to sticky science and renewable materials, that\u2019s changing.\n\nSilica is a good example and an increasingly important component.\n\nSilica is a good example and an increasingly important component. It not only displaces less renewable materials but also makes tires more efficient. \u201cConventional tires rely on carbon black to strengthen the rubber matrix as the tire is cured,\u201d Dale Harrigle, Bridgestone\u2019s chief engineer for replacement tires, says. \u201cIn a tire that uses silica in the tread compound, a portion of the carbon black is removed and replaced with silica, which allows for increased wet performance and reduced rolling resistance.\u201d\n\nSilica traditionally comes from sand, but that\u2019s changing. Goodyear, for example, is now using silica sourced from a rice processing byproduct called husk ash.\n\nIn other words: less harmful rubber, more grip, better wear, and better range or fuel economy.\n\nThe molecular menace\n\nFirestone\u2019s IndyCar tires.\n\nDrive long enough, and the well-defined tread patterns of even the most efficient tires will fade, slowly balding like a stressed-out environmental scientist\u2019s pate. It\u2019s easy to imagine that the lost rubber simply disappears, but the truth is more terrifying.\n\nTires break down into tire and road wear particles, or TRWP. This black dust accumulates on roads mostly \u2014 but not permanently. When it rains, it is carried away.\n\nA recent Pew Charitable Trusts report found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are synthetic tire rubber, which makes efforts to cut down on microfiber pollution from our laundry seem a bit quaint.\n\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is all these little wear particles full of all these nasty compounds settling in the environment and inside us and gradually leaching out their toxins,\u201d says Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, an independent group focused on testing and data about the overall environmental impacts of transportation.\n\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is all these little wear particles full of all these nasty compounds settling in the environment and inside us and gradually leaching out their toxins.\u201d\n\nOne such toxin is 6PPD-quinone. A 2020 study from the University of Washington\u2019s Center for Urban Waters found that a dramatic decline in coho salmon populations was the result of the toxin. The salmon have now been placed on some West Coast endangered lists.\n\n\u201cShortly after birth, they were essentially going mad and dying,\u201d Molden says. \u201cThe researchers finally linked it to this compound in tires because it was happening after rainfall. The rainfall was washing all the accumulated tire material off the road into the harbors and into the shore.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t bad just for the salmon and the Pacific Northwest\u2019s fishing industry. 6PPD-quinone is in us, too, and it only comes from tires. 6PPD helps tires resist environmental damage, thus lasting longer between replacements. When 6PPD reacts with ozone, it becomes 6PPD-quinone.\n\n\u201cThe product 6PPD-quinone, which was identified in late 2020, requires more research to understand what impact, if any, it may have on aquatic life or the environment,\u201d Goodyear SVP of global operations and CTO Chris Helsel says. That\u2019s hardly a mea culpa, but the tire industry genuinely has been an active partner in studying the problem.\n\nGoodyear and other members of the US Tire Manufacturers Association actually encouraged 6PPD-targeting regulation enacted by the California Environmental Protection Agency and have provided free tire compound samples to researchers. \u201cFor the next five years, if you want to sell tires in California, you need to go through the process of either eliminating 6PPD, or at least properly researching the alternatives,\u201d Molden says.\n\n\u201cWe are collaborating with researchers and other scientists to better understand this transformation product, fill knowledge gaps, and determine next steps,\u201d says Helsel.\n\nOther initiatives are coming to limit overall tire emissions, including the upcoming Euro 7 regulations, which put caps on tire wear particles as well as other emissions.\n\nThat seems like progress, but Emissions Analytics\u2019 Molden isn\u2019t so sure: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m worried about that is I\u2019m sure you can reduce that wear mass, but if you do that by making the compound more toxic, you could actually make the environmental impact worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could actually make the environmental impact worse.\u201d\n\nThat could be akin to increasing a car\u2019s fuel efficiency by switching to leaded fuel.\n\nMolden believes that what\u2019s needed is better understanding. To that end, he\u2019s recently created the Tyre Emissions Research Consortium, a LinkedIn group with about 1,000 members. The intent is to break down the silos that individual researchers were working in.\n\nResearch into 6PPD replacements is ongoing, and the US Tire Manufacturers Association is also touting research into various ways to mitigate and reduce tire debris pollution.\n\nGiven all that research is happening at an industry level, it\u2019s easy to feel a little helpless about the role we\u2019re all playing in contributing this pollution to the environment when we\u2019re just trying to get to work. Still, there are things that we can do to help minimize the environmental impact in the interim.\n\nMolden suggests a few things: drive more slowly, drive more smoothly, and choose the right tires. According to Molden, the tires that your car was outfitted with when new will provide the best wear characteristics. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like going to a flight in restaurants, and each course has a wine match to the food,\u201d he says. Perfectly paired tires may cost more than whatever you can get at a local discounter, but they\u2019ll provide better wear and, ultimately, less pollution.\n\nEnd of the road\n\nMichelin\u2019s Uptis.\n\nEven the best tires will need to be replaced, either thanks to wear or the kind of roadside debris that can not only ruin a tire but also your entire day. The good news is that modern tires last a lot longer than they did before. \u201cIn the early 1970s, the typical wear life for a set of tires was approximately 20,000 miles in average driving conditions,\u201d Harrigle says. \u201cFast forward to today, and 80,000-mile wear warranties are relatively common.\u201d\n\nThe bad news is that we\u2019re still going through more tires than ever.\n\nThe bad news is that we\u2019re still going through more tires than ever. Harrigle says we scrap 250 million tires every year in North America. Again, about half are burned for fuel.\n\nBut there are other solutions. Recycling is one, but reuse is better, a process called retreading. Retreading itself is nothing new, but while it\u2019s generally fallen out of favor for consumer tires, on the industrial side of things, it can be a huge cost-saver \u2014 and environment-saver, too.\n\nJason Roanhouse, VP of North American Bandag operations at Bridgestone Mobility Solutions, says that the company\u2019s retread business has saved 300 million tires from being thrown out, worth roughly 4 billion gallons of oil.\n\nFuture tires\n\nWhile efforts to find sustainable replacements for tire manufacturing compounds continue, as does research into what today\u2019s compounds do to our health, many manufacturers are trying to change the equation altogether.\n\nA near-future example is the Michelin Uptis, a non-pneumatic tire. It relies on modern composites instead of air pressure to provide the right mix of stiffness and flex with significantly more durability. Michelin says it could reduce tire replacements by 20 percent. Variations of this theme have been in development for decades, but models are in testing now for consumer and industrial use.\n\nGoodyear gave us a more radical vision of a more distant future tire with 2020\u2019s ReCharge concept, which proposed that a biodegradable tread could be recharged simply by inserting refillable capsules with seasonal compounds. As a concept, it\u2019s pretty far out there. Goodyear\u2019s Helsel confesses as much, calling them \u201cpurely conceptual designs\u201d that \u201cmight never be produced as such.\u201d However, he says that the non-pneumatic nature of those concepts, and the advanced sensors embedded within, are indicative of ongoing research into future tires.\n\nAnother concept, though, is less about increasing the sustainability of tires and more about increasing the viability of EVs. At this year\u2019s Japan Mobility Show, Bridgestone showed off what it calls a \u201cWireless In-Wheel Tire.\u201d The concept is simple: turn every tire into an inductive charging pad for your EV. Previous wireless, in-motion charging concepts for EVs struggled to maintain strong rates because the car kept bouncing up and down as it moved.\n\nWireless charging works best when there\u2019s minimal distance between the charger and the device being charged. So, in this case, the tires themselves contain the receiving coils since, again, they\u2019re the only part of the car that actually touches the ground.\n\nSolutions like this seem fanciful, but they at least show that there\u2019s still a lot of room to rethink what a tire can and should be."

    "body": "By the IoT Analytics team.\n\nA new report from IoT Analytics highlights eight notable trends helping to advance and promote digital twins.\n\nFour of these trends are discussed in detail in this article. These trends are shaping the future of the digital twin market and influencing investment priorities for companies across various industries.\n\nKey insights:\n\nAccording to our Digital Twin Market Report 2023\u20132027, the digital twin market is expanding, with a projected CAGR of 30% between 2023 and 2027.\n\n29% of global manufacturing companies have either fully or partially implemented their digital twin strategies. Further, job posts related to digital twins have increased by 11% compared to October 2021, while openings for other tech topics have declined in the same timeframe.\n\nThe report notes eight notable trends helping to advance and promote digital twins, four of which are discussed in this article.\n\nDigital twin market snapshot\n\nData from our Digital Twin Market Report 2023\u20132027 indicates that 29% of global manufacturing companies have either fully or partially implemented their digital twin strategies, marking a noticeable increase from 20% in 2020. Moreover, the proportion of these companies not contemplating the implementation of digital twins appears to have reduced to 9% in 2023, down from 33.6% in 2020.\n\nSupporting this trend, an analysis of job postings on SimplyHired suggests a growing demand for digital twin expertise. Postings mentioning \u201cdigital twin\u201d increased by 11% in October 2023 compared to just two years prior, while openings for most other tech topics declined in the same timeframe. Notably, among the 60 tech-related skill sets we tracked, digital twin-related skills experienced one of the most significant growths.\n\nBased on these observations and additional insights from our report, our current projection estimates that the global digital twin market could grow at a CAGR of approximately 30% between 2023 and 2027.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this growing market, the report notes eight trends that help promote the advancement and adoption of digital twins. Here, we will focus on four:\n\n1. Digital twins deployed to meet sustainability goals\n\n2. Digital twins employed as virtual sensors in complex conditions\n\n3. Partnerships between cloud hyperscalers and OT and simulation specialists\n\n4. Initiatives promoting interoperability of digital twins across multifaceted systems\n\nBefore we dive into these trends, and to provide context, it is helpful to understand how IoT Analytics defines digital twins and the digital twin market.\n\nDefining digital twins and the digital twin market\n\nIn our March 2023 Decoding Digital Twins article, we define digital twins as a virtual model replicating the behavior of an existing or a potential real-world asset, system, or multiple systems. This definition captures a macro concept of digital twins, but our report and previous article present a three-dimensional, cuboid model to help classify digital twins so apple-to-apple comparisons can be made. Each axis of the cuboid represents one dimension of a digital twin:\n\n1. Life cycle phase: The X-axis represents the six life cycle phases a digital twin is used for, from design to decommissioning.\n\n2. Hierarchical levels: The Y-axis represents a digital twin\u2019s five hierarchical levels, from information to multi-system.\n\n3. Use/purpose of implementation: The Z-axis represents the seven most common uses for digital twins, such as simulation and prediction.\n\nBased on this model, there are 210 potential combinations (5 x 6 x 7 = 210); however, our research indicates that many digital twin initiatives are tailored to multiple combinations.\n\nIn terms of the digital twin market, our market model only considers software spending for digital twins, which we break into two scopes:\n\nBroad digital twin market \u2013 includes the revenue for all software solutions that provide capabilities that are used for digital twins, such as solutions that integrate data sources into a digital twin and are capable of simulation, visualization, and predictions\n\n\u2013 includes the revenue for all software solutions that provide capabilities that are used for digital twins, such as solutions that integrate data sources into a digital twin and are capable of simulation, visualization, and predictions Narrow digital twin market \u2013 only considers spending for digital twin-specific software, such as software intended to model the digital twin data\n\nThough hardware and services related to digital twins can bolster the capabilities of digital twin software, we only view them as supporting services for the software, and we do not consider them in our digital twin market model. That said, this ability to bolster capabilities means they can aid digital twin market growth, as shown in some of the trends below.\n\nDigital twin market trends\n\nWe will now look at four trends helping digital twin market growth.\n\nTrend 1: Digital twins deployed to meet sustainability goals\n\nSustainability was discussed in approximately 21% of recent CEO earnings calls and has remained a consistent topic throughout 2023. This pairs with our report\u2019s analysis that the pursuit of sustainability goals is a tailwind macro factor for the digital twin market.\n\nTo achieve their sustainability goals, many companies are exploring digital twins. Due to their ability to simulate real-world conditions and deliver real-time information, organizations can optimize resource usage, reducing carbon emissions and improving supply and transportation networks.\n\nAccording to Capgemini Research Institute\u2019s 2022 digital twins report, 57% of organizations agreed that one of the key drivers for their digital twin investments was improving their sustainability, and 51% agreed that digital twins would help achieve their organization\u2019s environmental sustainability goals.\n\nIn our report, a former VP at an industrial automation vendor shared, \u201cDigital solutions provide the visibility, analysis, and insight needed to address the challenges inherent in sustainability goals. A digital twin strategy as part of an overall digitalization plan can be a crucial capability for asset-intensive industries and needs to encompass the entire asset lifecycle, process, and value chain from design and operations through maintenance and strategic business planning.\u201d\n\nExample: Aden, a Chinese integrated facility service provider, created a digital twin for one of its commercial centers in Chengdu, China. The digital twin was designed to help facility managers inspect, maintain, and repair building assets. 3D simulations assist facility managers in visualizing, predicting, and optimizing energy consumption, and the expected benefits include lower annual energy consumption, water usage, and waste.\n\nTrend 2: Digital twins employed as virtual sensors in complex conditions\n\nVirtual sensors approximate data that otherwise cannot be obtained via physical sensors, often due to physical sensors being impractical, costly, or hazardous to employ. Companies are now building digital twins to model hardware and calculate data based on other conditions. This not only allows the collection of data from complex equipment but also enables operators to track equipment performance and predict maintenance and downtimes.\n\nExample: In large motor applications, such as room-sized motors that pump high volumes of gas, oil, or other chemicals, operators need to monitor the motors\u2019 temperatures\u2014especially if the motors are high-powered and repeatedly started. If a motor is too hot during a restart, the components could cause serious damage. Unfortunately, using a direct, physical sensor within a motor is often impractical, and operators must work from an assumptive time it takes for the motor to cool (with an additional safety buffer time). This means motors can be down longer than necessary, impacting efficiency and revenue.\n\nTo address this issue, Siemens developed a prototype virtual sensor based on a digital twin. It offers a simulation of how a physical sensor would operate if it were possible to install it within a motor. Using AR headsets, operators can see a simulation of the motor and its interior with a demonstrator superimposed over it, and they can see the motor\u2019s temperature.\n\nTrend 3: Partnerships forged in the clouds: Hyperscalers team up with OT and simulation specialists\n\nIn the last few years, cloud hyperscalers like AWS and Microsoft Azure have introduced digital twin platforms, e.g., AWS IoT TwinMaker and Azure Digital Twins, that allow for interconnecting various data sources and building digital twin topology. However, these companies realize they cannot deliver end-to-end digital twin solutions by themselves and are thus partnering with OT and simulation companies to add capabilities to their networks.\n\nHyperscalers and OT companies\n\nOT companies provide industrial data management capabilities and connections to millions of local physical assets. By partnering with hyperscalers, OT companies can reach broader audiences looking for digital transformation solutions by offering typical cloud benefits like storage and computation power.\n\nExample: In 2021, Siemens and AWS announced an expansion of their partnership, with digital twin technology being an area of focus. The companies aimed to accelerate Siemens Xcelerator adoption and democratize new digital twin solutions using AWS IoT TwinMaker, a service intended to make creating digital twins that incorporate multiple data sources faster and easier.\n\nHyperscalers and simulation companies\n\nSimulation companies bring specialized expertise in creating accurate, high-fidelity models of physical entities, be it machinery, buildings, or entire ecosystems. By partnering with a hyperscaler, simulation companies can harness these cloud services\u2019 data storage and computational power to create more robust, responsive, and accurate data twins that can be scaled and integrated seamlessly into broader IT ecosystems.\n\nExample: In 2023, Ansys and Microsoft announced a partnership to help customers envision digital twins on a large scale. In cooperation with Tata Consultancy Services, Ansys and Microsoft integrated Ansys\u2019s Twin Builder\u2019s physics-based simulation capabilities with Azure Digital Twin and IoT data to allow Twin Builder users to run scenarios and obtain predictions on how their systems will behave.\n\nTrend 4: Initiatives promoting interoperability of digital twins across systems from different vendors\n\nAgreement on integration standards among the various digital twin technology providers is crucial for building cross-system digital twins. With standards, manufacturers can offer services that can be applied to unique situations with other digital twin technology and software.\n\nRecognizing this, countries and industry organizations have taken several steps to address this need:\n\nPlattform Industrie 4.0 and CESMII\n\nPlattform Industrie 4.0 and the Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII) partnered to establish standards for manufacturers in Germany and the United States to better enable smart, sustainable competition. The partnership addressed similar challenges related to Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing.\n\nDTC digital twin interoperability framework\n\nThe Digital Twin Consortium (DTC), a collaborative partnership of industry, academia, and government experts, released the Digital Twin System Interoperability Framework to \u201cunify a nascent ecosystem of high-value, multi-vendor services that can seamlessly \u2018plug into\u2019 a multi-dimensional, interoperable system of systems.\u201d\n\nDTC and IDTA collaboration\n\nDTC and the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA) announced a liaison agreement to collaborate on standardization requirements, enabling interoperability through discussions, aligning work in horizontal domains, and collaborating on open-source projects, contributions, and reference implementations.\n\nDTC and OPC Foundation collaboration\n\nDTC and the OPC Foundation announced a liaison agreement to \u201caccelerate the development and adoption of digital twin-enabling technologies,\u201d promoting interoperability standards and processes to advance the use of digital twins in manufacturing across multiple industries.\n\nConsiderations for digital twin vendors\n\n3 questions digital twin vendors should ask themselves based on research findings discussed in this article:\n\n1. Sustainability goals: Given the emphasis on sustainability and the role of digital twins in achieving it, is my company\u2019s digital twin solution well-equipped to support sustainability objectives? Are there new features we need to develop?\n\n2. Interoperability: Is our digital twin solution currently designed to be interoperable with other systems and technologies, especially those from different vendors?\n\n3.

    "body": "In 2021, Quentin Tarantino defended his intention to make \u201cjust\u201d 10 movies and retire, saying, \u201cI know film history, and from here on in, directors do not get better.\u201d That view of both artistry and film is squarely at odds with Martin Scorsese\u2019s historic body of work. Scorsese had already made his 10th feature-length narrative film by 1986. He is now 80 years old, and his 27th, Killers of the Flower Moon, is a strong argument that directors are still capable of groundbreaking greatness late in life \u2014 and in Scorsese\u2019s case, continued exhilarating experimentation and discovery.\n\nSince the year 2000, Scorsese has curated a 23-year career within a career, and the quality and variety of his films have come not in spite of his age and experience, but because of it. His movies have never been more relevant than they became during the past two decades. With each subsequent release, as his career winds down, critical appreciation for him grows. Scorsese worship is the one remaining form of gerontocracy America is perfectly content with, and with good reason.\n\nIn the 21st century alone, Scorsese has made nine feature-length narrative films: Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, Hugo, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, The Irishman, and now, Killers of the Flower Moon. His stretch from 1976\u2019s Taxi Driver through 1990\u2019s Goodfellas is still his peak run, the films that defined his style and his perspective. But decades from now, the nine features he\u2019s made since 2000 won\u2019t be looked back on as half-baked, indulgent afterthoughts from a diminished artist who lost his fastball, a fate some great auteurs suffer in old age. Instead, it\u2019s a fertile, vital body of work, virtuosic in entirely new ways, and as important in contextualizing his greatness as all the incredible work that preceded it.\n\nOld classics\n\nSome of those nine movies are long-gestating bucket-list triumphs revisiting the pet subjects that defined Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre in the 20th century, often directly commenting on work from the front half of his career. 2002\u2019s Gangs of New York, about how organized crime was woven into the operation of Scorsese\u2019s native city from its inception, is a prequel (or ancestor) to his classics Goodfellas and Casino. 2019\u2019s The Irishman, about a man aging and dying with his guilt and sins unresolved at the end of a life of crime, is intended as a bookend to his crime trilogy with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. 2016\u2019s Silence is in conversation with, if not a synthesis of, the ideas explored in The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun; all three are searching, anti-commercial religious films Scorsese struggled for years to get made.\n\nIn all Scorsese\u2019s late-period films (along with the passel of rock documentaries he\u2019s made during this era, including his two on Bob Dylan and one on George Harrison), Scorsese is consciously returning to certain pet subjects and periods in his work \u2014 not to repeat himself, but to revise and add greater perspective. There\u2019s a sense that he\u2019s trying to adjust his positions with the clear eye of an older person who has seen more of the world, dropped his pretensions, and lost his capacity for bullshit. His later films return to his old themes and obsessions, but in the process, they\u2019ve become more contemplative.\n\nNew tricks\n\nThis era has included some radical departures for Scorsese as well. 2004\u2019s The Aviator is his most conventional movie to date, the most traditional, Oscar-baity, Old Hollywood biography he\u2019s made. It\u2019s best understood as a director-for-hire palate-cleanser after Scorsese completed the odyssey of making the perpetually troubled Gangs of New York. 2010\u2019s Shutter Island is horror and suspense, an expert exercise in pure genre, part Hammer Films and part Alfred Hitchcock. It also contains some of the most inventive, moving, and painterly visuals he\u2019s ever committed to film.\n\nAnd 2011\u2019s Hugo is perhaps the hardest Scorsese film to imagine a younger Scorsese making. It\u2019s a 3D Robert Zemeckis-style family film that\u2019s also about the end of life and about immortality in art. Scorsese made the film as a love letter to Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Harold Lloyd, and his own then-12-year-old daughter, Francesca. It\u2019s a project seemingly designed to remind fathers of all the times they tried to introduce their kids to their favorite old films. Hugo is explicitly about Scorsese\u2019s legendary cinephilia in a way his films that came before it are not, and it\u2019s sentimental in a way his work has never been before or since.\n\nNew life\n\n2002\u2019s Gangs of New York was the final product of an interesting but ultimately flawed compromise between Scorsese and producer Harvey Weinstein. But the film retains significance because it\u2019s the beginning of the defining relationship in this portion of Scorsese\u2019s career, with Leonardo DiCaprio. It was a symbiotic partnership that elevated both men: the industry outsider who needed a safe box-office bet to finally get his epic, expensive dream projects financed, and the teen heartthrob who needed an auteur with arthouse gravitas to take him seriously so the industry would.\n\nTo date, the project has been wildly successful, producing six films over 21 years. The first five (Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street) are Scorsese\u2019s top five highest-grossing films, with the box office for Killers incoming. Over the years, the Scorsese-DiCaprio team-up has served as a true creative marriage. The two men now share a manager in Rick Yorn, the man responsible for discovering DiCaprio. It\u2019s evidence DiCaprio hasn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d been a muse and face on the posters; he\u2019s had a say in deciding what projects Scorsese has taken on, and has even made significant decisions in shaping Scorsese\u2019s stories. (Scorsese entirely reimagined Killers of the Flower Moon after DiCaprio offered notes on an early draft of the script, including shifting focus to a different main character and moving DiCaprio into that role.)\n\nFor certain older filmmakers \u2014 say, Clint Eastwood \u2014 aging has meant settling for more routine and less challenging stories and shots, on a tight production schedule. Scorsese went in the other direction. From the outside, The Departed appears to be a cynical, domestic remake of a Hong Kong cops-and-robbers shootout. But Scorsese makes it his own and breathes bizarre life and energy into it. It contains the continuity errors, quick cutting, both rhythmic and arrhythmic needle bombs, and goofball humor his movies hadn\u2019t featured since Goodfellas. That film essentially birthed an entire genre of filmic language, but The Departed goes a step beyond the original. It was constantly being rewritten and adjusted with the actors on the fly. The result was exhilarating seat-of-the-pants filmmaking that Scorsese and his longtime creative partner, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, wrangled into a coherent film.\n\nScorsese brought this cokey, maximalist energy to The Wolf of Wall Street, a pointed comedy as wildly, masterfully off the rails and improvisational as anything he\u2019s ever done. (Jonah Hill perhaps smuggled in a touch of Judd Apatow\u2019s \u201cKeep the camera rolling\u201d ethos.) You can feel a healthy dose of Scorsese\u2019s established-filmmaker confidence (and a touch of \u201cEh, why not? Fuck it!\u201d thinking) as DiCaprio\u2019s Ferrari changes color mid-narration during a highway blowjob, and when DiCaprio addresses the camera directly, urging the audience not to worry about specific plot points. It\u2019s an absolute miracle Scorsese and Schoonmaker manage to produce a masterpiece out of the chaotic pieces of this production process (again in post, with ample voice-over). Everyone is letting loose, and to hear the actors and the director describe the shoot after the fact, it takes on something of a religious quality, with Scorsese as the wrinkled shaman handing out the peyote.\n\nWhat grounds it is the framing. Scorsese is telling us a familiar story we\u2019ve come to expect from him, about criminals and the pleasure they take in committing crimes and reaping the benefits. The brilliance is the way he mines filmgoers\u2019 long relationship with his work, repurposing the style and tone of his gangster classics and inserting it into the world of finance. As he\u2019s done effectively since Casino, Scorsese weaponizes postmodernism, using viewers\u2019 presumed existing familiarity with his films as context. You don\u2019t get the full gale force of this film, its pleasures and its overarching point, without Scorsese reaching back to his past work, and relying on viewers to recognize his voice in the storytelling.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is perhaps most closely related to The Aviator as a film that appears to be a recognizable, industry-friendly form of awards-season prestige. It\u2019s also a return to Scorsese\u2019s core themes and characters. It\u2019s another cast of avarice-fueled, violent white American dumbasses gaining ill-gotten wealth and making the country incrementally worse. It\u2019s again about those men failing up, consolidating power, and shading the country more evil.\n\nKillers adapts a major literary work of historical true crime from a New Yorker writer. The book delves into an obscure but monstrous historical incident that is a cosmic truth in miniature, an evil that speaks to the heart of the entire dark American project. On screen, it\u2019s Scorsese\u2019s first true Western, filled with gorgeous vistas and Oklahoma horizons that would bring a tear to the eye of John Ford, one of Scorsese\u2019s many idols.\n\nBut the film is much stranger than it sounds on paper. Scorsese\u2019s take on the material largely operates outside the text, centering the story on a peripheral character we know little about from David Grann\u2019s book. Miraculously, the film also has its funny elements, incorporating The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street\u2019s nervy energy, featuring long and zany improvisational exchanges on grim subject matter, sudden wild swings in tone, and one major decision that should spark more debate and differences of opinion than any narrative device Scorsese has ever employed. It\u2019s a suspenseful, moving film with many brilliant parts.\n\nKillers is a classic Scorsese Catholic reckoning. This time, the director is concerned with white supremacy and systemic racism, full of unsparing and punishing conclusions and self recriminations in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and the 2020 protests. (In a press conference on Oct. 16, Scorsese described the film as \u201ca story of complicity, a story of sin by omission.\u201d)\n\nScorsese is expressing guilt and culpability as a beneficiary of this inequality. In the movie\u2019s closing minutes, he literally puts himself squarely in the frame. That\u2019s a level of awareness that goes beyond the introverted morality plays he grappled with earlier in his career: It\u2019s a mature framing of the individual, and the responsibilities we have toward one another, on a societal scale.\n\nIn a charitable light, adding himself to the movie as the voice of its final reckoning is a bold statement of accountability. In an uncharitable light, it plays as performative, as an older relative getting worked up over a police brutality Facebook post. It\u2019s too early to decide how this film tags into our present historical moment, or how it will be remembered. We all have many viewings of and conversations about Killers of the Flower Moon ahead of us.\n\nA true master\n\nThis century has seen Scorsese zigging and zagging as always, but because he\u2019s following his own varied interests, not because he\u2019s moving from compromise to compromise, as he once had to in order to continue working. An artist who spent the first 30 years of his career desperate for autonomy finally got it, and now he\u2019s taking full advantage: telling difficult stories, setting his own mega-budgets, and demanding every minute of run time he feels each picture demands.\n\nHe\u2019s used this autonomy to revisit his work and revise the record, creating great new films as well as adding crucial addendums to past work. He\u2019s blazing new trails and adding new layers to his style. Remarkably, getting the control that eluded him when he was younger has made his films more consistently collaborative and creative, more fluid and alive than he was often allowed to be prior to the 2000s. He has the earned confidence of an artist who has spent a lifetime in film and knows he\u2019ll be able to find something great in post. His late period has only added to his legend. That should give Tarantino cause to reconsider \u2014 alongside any artist or critic who thinks the creative spark has an expiration date."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMartin Scorsese has put his knowledge of internet slang to the test in a new TikTok challenge posted by none other than his daughter, Francesca Scorsese.\n\nIn a TikTok posted by Francesca on Thursday 5 October, the father-daughter duo appeared on camera while the legendary director\u2019s daughter explained that she was going to quiz him on popular internet slang. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to guess what specific slang terms mean,\u201d Francesca told her father, 80.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me the slang word and I have to give you what I think it means,\u201d Scorsese chimed in, in classic style.\n\nThe first - and arguably most important - internet slang word that Francesca quizzed her father on was \u201ctea\u201d, as she gave the example: \u201cI\u2019m going to spill the tea.\u201d\n\nThe Killers of the Flower Moon director shouted out his answer: \u201cThat means you\u2019re gonna tell all you know.\u201d\n\nFrancesca\u2019s face then lit up with shock after her father guessed the internet slang term somewhat correctly, and a green check mark emoji appeared over their heads.\n\nThe next term she gave her father was \u201cick\u201d and added the example: \u201cHe clapped when the plane landed and that gave me the ick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were thoroughly repulsed by it,\u201d Scorsese answered correctly, causing his daughter to burst out in laughter.\n\nThe third slang was \u201csneaky link\u201d - a term used when someone is going to discreetly meet up with their romantic interest. \u201cThese are our personal peccadillos that you may have,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that you don\u2019t want other people to know about, or just people close to you or something like that.\u201d\n\nWhen Francesca explained to her father that the term \u201csneaky link\u201d is similar to a \u201cbooty call\u201d, the Goodfellas director\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cOh, really? We never use that, we never saw specific people in my day,\u201d he replied, before curtly asking his daughter in his signature Italian-American accent: \u201cWhat else you got?\u201d\n\nFor the phrase \u201chits different\u201d, his daughter fittingly used a film reference to explain what the term means to her dad. \u201cWatching a movie in 70 mm film hits different,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy one. You perceive it in a totally different way,\u201d Scorsese responded. \u201cIt\u2019s another perspective of the image, so to speak, and the effect the film has on the audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, it\u2019s much better,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHits different, like: \u2018Oh, this is amazing.\u201d\n\nWhile the Wolf of Wall Street director answered the term \u201cslept on\u201d incorrectly, his reasoning for the definition wasn\u2019t totally inaccurate. \u201cI was thinking about some stuff so I slept on it,\u201d Scorsese said. However, Francesca then used the slang word in terms that only Scorsese could understand.\n\n\u201cKing of Comedy was slept on,\u201d she added, referring to her father\u2019s 1983 film starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy received mostly positive reviews from critics when it was released, but it was a flop at the box office.\n\n\u201cPeople hated it when it came out,\u201d he corrected himself, before turning his gaze towards the camera. \u201cIt was the flop of the year, that\u2019s what it was called on Entertainment Tonight, New Year\u2019s Eve \u201883 to \u201884. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\nThe father-daughter duo continued on with the term \u201cate\u201d, as Francesca used an example from Scorsese\u2019s upcoming film: \u201cLily Gladstone ate in Killers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Although he took the term \u201cate\u201d very literally by initially saying, \u201cConsumed the screen\u201d, Scorsese eventually came up with the simple answer: \u201cRuled.\u201d\n\nFor the slang term \u201cno cap\u201d, Scorsese instantly answered it correctly as \u201cno lying\u201d. However, he then asked his daughter in classic dad fashion: \u201cHow many more of these?\u201d\n\nWhen it came to the internet slang \u201cship\u201d, the Taxi Driver director wasted no time in replying: \u201cA ship is a boat.\u201d Francesca aided her father with the example, \u201cI ship you and mom,\u201d but he still didn\u2019t seem to understand the phrase. \u201cTake us around somewhere?\u201d\n\nThe next term was \u201csimp\u201d - meaning someone who displays excessive affection in a relationship - but Scorsese decided to come up with his own definition: \u201cSympathise, a simpy person. A person who\u2019s whining all the time, they\u2019re simps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimp used to mean a wimpy person, a person who\u2019s always complaining and stuff like that,\u201d he added. \u201cI do that a lot, complain a lot.\u201d\n\nFor the term \u201cthrow shade\u201d, Scorsese immediately understood what it meant after his daughter gave the film-themed example: \u201cThat critic threw so much shade.\u201d He was also quick to answer the slang \u201cslaps\u201d when Francesca said: \u201cThis dessert slaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s good,\u201d he replied.\n\nThe final internet slang Francesca gave her famous father was none other than the term, \u201cslay\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis video slays. We slayed in this video\u201d she gave the example, as the Gangs of New York director answered: \u201cThat means it\u2019s really good?\u201d\n\nSince it was posted on Thursday, Francesca\u2019s video of her father guessing popular slang terms has been viewed one million times on TikTok. Not only were people in the comments section shocked to see the legendary director on their screens, but they were also stunned that he managed to guess many of the terms correctly.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe we live in a world where I get to watch Martin Scorsese become familiar with the term sneaky link. Blessings,\u201d read one comment.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe I exist in a timeline where I can watch Martin Scorsese film TikToks,\u201d another said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m watching one of the greatest filmmakers of our lifetime be quizzed by his daughter about teen slang lol,\u201d a third user wrote, while someone else said: \u201cGonna describe sneaky links as personal picadillos from now on.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Scorsese has made a special appearance in one of his daughter\u2019s TikTok videos. In April 2021, Francesca went viral when she asked her father to identify \u201cfeminine products\u201d, such as an eyelash curler, bobby pins, a hair donut and nipple pasties."

    "body": "Crossover boxing matches are all the rage these days. Until a few days ago, the phenomenon was limited to influencers and MMA stars. But after a recent quarrel on X (formerly Twitter) between Conor McGregor and Canelo Alvarez, a potential crossover boxing match has the boxing world buzzing with excitement. If the fight were to turn into a reality, it could help \u2018Cinnamon\u2019 get closer to his former rival Floyd Mayweather in terms of net worth.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nThe talks of Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather began with a tweet that launched a fiery exchange of words between these two mammoths of combat sports. The brash and confident \u2018Notorious\u2019 McGregor turned to X, praising Mayweather\u2019s 2013 performance against Canelo. But he also boasted about landing more punches on \u2018Money\u2019 Mayweather than the Mexican superstar. Canelo quickly retorted, asserting he would need only one hand to make quick work of McGregor. Later, the banter further escalated, bringing a potential fight in the picture.\n\nCanelo Alvarez\u2019s earnings and Floyd Mayweather\u2019s influence\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nCanelo Alvarez reached his career high by becoming the first boxer to become the undisputed champion at super-middleweight by holding onto the WBA Super, WBC, and Ring Magazine super middleweight titles since 2020, and the IBF nd WBO titles since 2021. Meanwhile, his pockets became deeper and deeper, to the point that Canelo boasts a $180 million net worth in 2023. The most significant addition to his bank balance came when he signed a lucrative $365 million deal with DAZN and Golden Boy Promotions.\n\nvia Imago RECORD DATE NOT STATED Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX vs Jermell Charlo USA \u2013 Weigh-in ceremony Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX during the weigh-in ceremony prior to the Boxing fight against Jermell Charlo USA, at the T-Mobile Arena Explanade on September 29, 2023. brbr Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX durante la ceremonia de pesaje previo a la pelea de Box contra Jermell Charlo USA, en la Explanada del Arena T-Mobile el 29 de septiembre de 2023.

When Mayweather defeated Canelo, it pushed him to hone his skills while starting a lifelong rivalry. On the other hand, McGregor made his boxing debut against Mayweather, losing the fight but leaving with a fat stack.\n\nImplications of a fight between Canelo Alvarez and Conor McGregor\n\nThe excitement and allure of two mammoths of combat sports getting in the ring to pummel each other to the brink of their endurance is undeniable. Not to mention, the fight will leave either party significantly wealthier than before. A potential clash between Saul Canelo Alvarez and the \u2018Notorious\u2019 Conor McGregor would not just be a dream come true for fans everywhere. It would also be a money magnet that would funnel income from a variety of channels.\n\nA few of those lucrative channels of income would be revenue from pay-per-view sales, live gate revenue, merchandise sales from either party and various promotional events from the fight. What\u2019s more, if anyone wondered if people would want to watch the fight. The attention it has gathered in the small span of their X (Twitter) feud should be evidence enough. Not to mention, both fighters command a massive fan base, counted in millions across the globe.\n\nCanelo Alvarez and McGregor\u2019s history of massive purses\n\nIf Canelo\u2019s PPV pull was ever in question, his history of fight purses should convince everyone. Stepping back in time, Canelo\u2019s fight with Mayweather collected 2.2 million pay-per-view buys. His 2017 bout against Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. collected 1 million PPV buys. Canelo\u2019s first battle with Gennady Golovkin gathered 1.3 million PPV sales. In his most recent battle against Jermell Charlo, the fight collected 700K PPV sales. These were just to name a few; over the years, Canelo has fought in increasingly profitable bouts.\n\nOn the other hand, Conor McGregor has created his own history in MMA as well as boxing. First of all, McGregor\u2019s fight against Mayweather generated 4.3 million pay-per-view buys. His second fight against Dustin Poirier collected 1.6 million buys. The infamous fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov saw 2.4 million PPV sales. And lastly, his second fight against Nate Diaz collected 1.65 million PPV buys. If these numbers are any evidence, a Canelo vs. McGregor clash would break all their previous records by a mile.\n\nA substantial step toward Mayweather\u2019s net worth/Billionaire status\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Floyd Mayweather is the richest boxer in the world. The legendary undefeated boxer boasts a staggering net worth of $450 million. It makes the retired boxer the richest personality in boxing to ever exist. Despite retiring from the sport, he occasionally fights in exhibition matches, generating millions each time. In addition, Floyd has made over a billion dollars in the span of his career.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nvia Getty LAS VEGAS, NEVADA \u2013 JUNE 29: Floyd Mayweather Jr. attends a game between the New York Liberty and the Las Vegas Aces at Michelob ULTRA Arena on June 29, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, despite Floyd\u2019s massive net worth, Canelo has inched closer to Floyd\u2019s billionaire status over the years. If Canelo vs. McGregor ever manages to materialize, it could help Canelo take a significant leap to Mayweather\u2019s net worth. The financial windfall from such a humongous clash would be substantial, driving him closer to Mayweather\u2019s level of wealth. If Canelo\u2019s past earnings are any evidence, this fight will be bigger than ever before. Canelo\u2019s biggest fight to date is $45 million from the third encounter with Golovkin. So, a fight with McGregor could earn him anywhere from $55 to $60 million, adding to his $180 million. Meaning his total net worth would jump up to $240 million.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile matching Floyd\u2019s net worth is no easy feat, if anyone can do it \u2013 it\u2019s Canelo Alvarez. However, only time will tell if the fight can ever materialize. In case it does, it will be a spectacle the whole world would come together to witness. Do you think McGregor vs. Canelo can happen? Who would win the fight?\n\nWatch This Story: Here\u2019s How $200,000,000 Worth Canelo Alvarez Spent His First Ever Million"

    "body": "X plans to use payment, phone and ID verification to stop bots, in addition to the new $1/yr fee\n\nIt\u2019s official: X is charging users to use its service \u2014 a move X owner Elon Musk said would help the company combat bots and spam, something he\u2019s repeatedly complained about even before acquiring the social network. But while critics, including WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg, have suggested that fees alone will not stymie the efforts of determined spammers, an X engineer took to the platform to explain that the nominal $1 per year fee was not the only tool X planned to use to deal with its bot problem. Instead, it\u2019s only one piece of a broader plan to stop bots that may also include payment, phone and ID verification, in addition to traditional bot-catching methods involving heuristics.\n\nOn X, director of engineering Eric Farraro wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of cynical takes about the $1 \u2018Not a Bot\u2019 feature and the verification program in general.\u201d He said he understood the skepticism but noted that, in a matter of years, AI will be able to mimic human interactions by doing things like solving CAPTCHAs and generating photos and videos that will be \u201cundetectable by human or AI countermeasures.\u201d That means current methods of catching bots will need to evolve.\n\n\u201cIf you can avoid getting identified as a bot, why can\u2019t an intelligent AI do the same?,\u201d Farraro asked.\n\nI've read a lot of cynical takes about the $1 'Not a Bot' feature and the verification program in general. I understand why people are skeptical, but consider a thought experiment: Are you sophisticated enough to evade X's bot detection? The answer is of course, yes, because\u2026 \u2014 Eric Farraro (@EFarraro) October 18, 2023\n\nHowever, critics have pointed out that a small fee like $1 or even $8 won\u2019t stop all bots. For instance, Mullenweg argued that spammers buy domains to use at a cost that\u2019s \u201cusually a lot more than a dollar per year,\u201d and that \u201cmillions are used for spam or nefarious purposes.\u201d In addition, he said spammers may also use stolen credit cards and identities to conduct their transactions.\n\n\u201cCharging may cause a short-term drop in bots while the bad guys update their scripts, but the value of manipulating X/Twitter is so high I imagine there is already millions of dollars being spent on it,\u201d Mullenweg wrote on his blog.\n\nFarraro seemed to largely agree with this assessment, admitting that X\u2019s goal was \u201cto make it difficult and expensive enough that it\u2019s less and less viable,\u201d as opposed to stopping the bot problem outright. \u201cRight now, the cost to have a human or script create accounts is pennies. Increasing the cost to even $1 starts to make this process much more expensive,\u201d he explained. But, he added, fees were not the only tool X planned to use.\n\n\u201cAt X, we\u2019re exploring using payment & phone verification, as well as ID verification, as part of a larger strategy to fight bots. We of course use more traditional heuristics and models to detect fake accounts [and] engagement on the platform. These two things are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Farraro said, concluding that other networks would likely follow suit in the years ahead.\n\nHis statements mirrored comments recently made by Elon Musk, who said X would be \u201cmoving to a small monthly payment\u201d for use of the X system. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can think of to combat vast armies of bots,\u201d he remarked during a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, which had largely focused on AI tech, regulation and hate speech in the wake of Musk\u2019s recent spat with the Anti-Defamation League, which had accused both Musk and X of being antisemitic.\n\n\u201cBecause a bot costs a fraction of a penny \u2014 call it a tenth of a penny \u2014 but even if it has to pay\u2026a few dollars or something, the effective cost of bots is very high,\u201d Musk said at the time. Plus, every time a bot creator wanted to make another bot, they would need another new payment method, he explained. Today, he added that the fee \u201cwon\u2019t stop bots completely, but it will be 1000x harder to manipulate the platform.\u201d\n\nCorrect, read for free, but $1/year to write. It\u2019s the only way to fight bots without blocking real users. This won\u2019t stop bots completely, but it will be 1000X harder to manipulate the platform. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 18, 2023\n\nThe plan to charge X new users $1 per year, currently only live in test markets of New Zealand and the Philippines, is the latest significant change to the network formerly known as Twitter since its acquisition by Elon Musk, who has revamped its subscription offering, refocused efforts on supporting creators and rebranded the network as \u201cX,\u201d as part of his broader plan to turn the social network into an everything app encompassing text, live and recorded, audio and video calling, payments and more.\n\nHowever, the timing of the bot-countering measure comes at a time when X is facing more competition than ever before. As Musk\u2019s chaotic product and policy changes have taken root, some X users abandoned the platform for rivals or decreased their posting. A report this week from market intelligence firm Similarweb, for example, found that X\u2019s web traffic and monthly active users on mobile had declined post-acquisition.\n\nUsers today have far more options for microblogging and public discourse, thanks to products from Twitter-like startups and tech companies such as Spill, Bluesky, Pebble, Countersocial, Spoutible, Hive and the open source platform Mastodon, as well as efforts from tech giants, like Meta\u2019s new app Threads. Few of the other social apps currently charge a fee, unless it\u2019s for premium features, like some of the third-party Mastodon apps do.\n\nIn addition to presenting friction at sign-up, other critics have argued a fee could exclude genuine users and increase the digital divide.\n\n\u201cEven the differences in the cost of living in the Philippines and New Zealand, the ability to afford $1 is not the same in the two countries,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University, who studies computing systems in the Global South. \u201cEven if the rationale behind creating a paywall is right, such policies would broaden the digital divide, making it difficult for people in the Philippines to be part of a global community on X compared to those in New Zealand,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the idea of charging users a small fee to use a social platform is not a new idea. WhatsApp for years charged users a $1 annual fee up until 2016, as a means of monetization ahead of its creation of commercial services.\n\nGiven that X\u2019s current tests are only an experiment, it\u2019s not clear that the $1 fee will be a permanent requirement when the new subscription policy rolls out more broadly to other markets."

    "body": "With Amo, the founder of Zenly wants to make social apps social again The startup raised $20 million and is launching ID today\n\nIn 2018, I wrote a TechCrunch article stating that 2018 was \u201cthe year social networks were no longer social.\u201d Reflecting on that article, I\u2019m not sure that 2018 was the turning point. But the premise of the article still holds up well.\n\nAt some point, social networks were no longer about connecting with your closest friends, keeping up with long-distance family members and feeling a special connection with people you love.\n\nTikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) are all slowly evolving to become the same infinite scrollable feed of algorithm-optimized short videos from top performers.\n\nAnd it turns out that I\u2019m not the only one who has noticed that social networks have been slowly drifting away from their original purpose. Amo, a small team based in Paris, has been working for the better part of 2023 on a brand new social app called ID.\n\nID is a social app launching today on iOS that lets you connect with your friends in a creative way. In many ways, it feels like the early days of blogs, Myspace\u2019s highly-personalized profile pages and the golden era of Tumblr.\n\nBut first, some context about Amo. There\u2019s a lot of hype and anticipation surrounding Amo\u2019s launch, as the company has been co-founded by Antoine Martin, who was the co-founder of Zenly with Alexis Bonillo. Zenly was a popular social app focused on location sharing that encouraged you to spend more time with your friends and discover new places.\n\nSnap spent more than $200 million to acquire Zenly and kept the same team to iterate on it, as a separate app. Under Snap\u2019s ownership, Zenly became one of Europe\u2019s biggest social apps of all time. At its peak the company had 18 million different users opening the app every day.\n\nAnd then\u2026 it disappeared.\n\nAs part of Snap\u2019s cost-cutting efforts, the company decided to shut down Zenly altogether. From what I\u2019ve heard, this move even triggered discussions between French politicians at the highest level and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nMany key members of the Zenly team are now working at Amo. In fact, there are 10 co-founders. In addition to Martin, Corentin Kerisit, Michael Goldenstein, Claire Pluvinage, Charly Delaroche, Julien Martin, Quentin Perez, Nicolas Fallourd, Alexis Druon and Jean-Baptiste Dalido are all Amo co-founders and all former Zenly people.\n\nThe second reason Amo\u2019s launch is highly anticipated is that the startup closed a $20 million (\u20ac18 million) funding round in February or March at a valuation around \u20ac100 million with New Wave leading the round, and Coatue and DST Global Partners also participating. There are also 80 angel investors on Amo\u2019s cap table.\n\nThis is a highly unusual funding round, as it happened in 2023 (during a VC funding downturn), Amo is a mobile consumer startup (no source of revenue for now) and the startup didn\u2019t have any product out there.\n\nAn empty canvas\n\nIn 2010, J\u00fcrgen Schweizer from Cultured Code, the company behind personal task management app Things, wrote a blog post shortly after Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad. In that post, he compared the iPad to an empty canvas.\n\n\u201cIf you want to understand what makes the iPad special, you cannot look at what it has, but what it doesn\u2019t have. The iPad is so thin and light, it becomes the display, and the display becomes the application. No input devices. The device vanishes and turns into the application you are using. The technology is transparent,\u201d Schweizer wrote.\n\nAnd this analogy applies particularly well to ID and Amo\u2019s work as well. There are many things that you can do with ID. There are also many things that we take for granted in a social app that simply aren\u2019t there.\n\nID is an empty canvas paired with creative tools that help you express yourself. You can use it to create a profile that perfectly describes your interests in a visual manner. But there\u2019s a social twist as you can both see your friends\u2019 profiles and add things to their own profiles.\n\nWhen you first create your profile on ID, you get an empty whiteboard that is waiting for content. You can fill it yourself in four different ways.\n\nYou can add stickers from your sticker library (more on that later), you can grab content from your photo library, you can write text or you can draw. When you choose a photo, ID automatically creates a cut-out of the main object or subject in the photo using PhotoRoom\u2019s technology.\n\nThis will feel immediately familiar to Pinterest users who love to build mood boards or software developers who cover their brand new laptop lid with stickers.\n\nEvery virtual object can be moved, resized and rotated. After a while, your profile becomes this sort of spatial canvas. You can make things so small that they sort of disappear\u2026 unless you zoom in.\n\nYou can create small islands that define what\u2019s on your mind right now. For instance, you can have a Los Angeles corner with the favorite buildings you saw during your vacation, group photos with your friends, the cup of your favorite coffee shop there, etc. You can also have a restaurant corner with photos of food from fancy restaurants where you\u2019ve recently been.\n\nEverything feels smooth and natural. You scroll, zoom in, zoom out, jump from one profile to the other. There\u2019s a sense of depth and space that I\u2019ve never seen in any other app. Photos never feel pixelated and you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re waiting for something to load.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been using ID for a while, things can become messy \u2014 but so is life. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fine. My personality is chaotic \u2014 our personalities are chaotic. They\u2019re multifaceted and they\u2019re not neatly arranged in a 3\u00d73 grid,\u201d Amo CEO Antoine Martin said.\n\nEmergent gameplay\n\nAs you start browsing around the app and looking at what\u2019s new on your friends\u2019 profile page, you may want to steal something for your own wall. ID lets you add content from other profiles to your sticker library so that you can either add it to your own profile or put it on someone else\u2019s profile.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the app for a little bit more than a week, and I can already see some trends spreading around the small community of beta users. You can see who originally created a sticker as it moves around from one wall to another. Some users have put nice shelves so they can neatly categorize everything that matters to them. A user created a guestbook section on her profile. \u201cIf you\u2019re dropping by, please leave a note here,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA few video games rely heavily on the player\u2019s creativity to have fun, such as Minecraft or recent Zelda games. In these games, you can create your own fortress or build your own vehicle.\n\nAnd that\u2019s also the main concept behind ID. Amo gives you the creative tools and a limitless Figma-like canvas. Now, it\u2019s up to the community to figure out what they want to do with it. And the best part is that it doesn\u2019t look like any other social app out there.\n\nMaybe Amo will end up fostering a creator economy with exclusive content that can really make your profile stand out. Maybe the company will add some premium features over time. For now, Amo wants to find a hit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prioritizing scale because my goal is to create an indestructible company. And it\u2019s Zenly\u2019s founder who is saying that! I used to think that 18 million [daily active users] would be enough to make a company indestructible. But I was wrong. I think you need 100 million [daily active users],\u201d Martin told me.\n\nCuring loneliness\n\nWhen the Amo team started working on ID, they wanted to find a way to cure loneliness. It seems a bit counterintuitive to build a social app as people spend so much time on their phone already. But, according to Antoine Martin, it\u2019s just that existing social apps don\u2019t have your best interests in mind.\n\n\u201cThe [World Health Organization] now calls it the loneliness epidemic. And if they say that it\u2019s an epidemic, it\u2019s because it\u2019s actually infectious. In other words, if you\u2019re isolated, your loved ones are too because you\u2019re unreachable. So during the two hours you\u2019re on TikTok, they have no one to talk to,\u201d Martin told me.\n\n\u201cAnd at the same time, the human needs that the social consumer space can fulfill are no longer covered by these products, whereas they used to be,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the early days of Facebook, I don\u2019t know if you remember, profiles were sort of a mash-up. There were drawings, games, photos, text. You\u2019d write long comments, it could be a poem . . . And on the other hand, it was a reminder that you mattered to these people.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the current generation of social networks are very passive. You don\u2019t have to do much to spend two hours on TikTok or YouTube because these companies want you to spend as much time as possible in these apps. \u201cWe aspire to go back to these earlier precepts and make them work,\u201d Martin said.\n\nThat\u2019s also the reason why Amo doesn\u2019t want you to spend hours in the app. When you have a few minutes, you can open the app to check what\u2019s new on your friends\u2019 profiles by swiping up on the notification cards.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve reached the last card, ID shows you a message that says \u201cget some fresh air.\u201d And then, the app closes itself. You\u2019re back on the home screen, you can put your phone back in your pocket.\n\nAmo & ID\n\nID is an opinionated take on social apps, but is it going to work? Given the past experience of the team and Amo\u2019s deep pockets, if there\u2019s one team that has a shot at trying something radically new in the space, it\u2019s Amo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deliberately shipping something eight or nine months after the launch of the company because we swore to ourselves that it wouldn\u2019t take us a year to get started, that we\u2019d learn more by building in public,\u201d Martin said.\n\nWhile ID is Amo\u2019s first idea, the company most likely has other ideas in the consumer social space \u2014 Amo didn\u2019t name its app \u201cAmo\u201d after all. So it\u2019s going to be interesting to follow the launch of this new app, but also Amo\u2019s story as a company."

    "body": "As fantasy football owners gear up for the last week of the fantasy regular season (in most leagues), our Week 14 fantasy WR PPR rankings are loaded top to bottom with just two teams on bye. Rolling out a strong receiving corps in a potential must-win week is essential, and we're here to shore up your start 'em, sit 'em concerns.\n\nThe highlight of our rankings is the long-awaited return of Justin Jefferson, who is (finally) set to suit up for the first time since Week 5. It's easy to forget, but in Jefferson's four full games this year, he averaged just over eight receptions and 135.8 yards per game while scoring three total touchdowns. Few receivers can dominate as he can, so we're happy to welcome him back.\n\nOf course, Jefferson's return only helps one owner in each league, so let's break down the rest of the WR rankings to help you finish your season with a win.\n\nWhich WRs are on bye in Week 14?\n\nThe final set of bye weeks sees only the Commanders and Cardinals idle, resulting in the losses of Terry McLaurin, Marquise Brown, Jahan Dotson, Curtis Samuel, Rondale Moore, and Greg Dortch.\n\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nEven worse, Washington and Arizona sit as two of the weakest pass defenses in the league, so fantasy owners won't be able to count on big stats from their receivers going against the Commanders and Cardinals.\n\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWho are the best fantasy WRs in Week 14?\n\nThe league's leading receiver, Tyreek Hill (vs. Titans in Week 14), stands as the unquestioned WR1 for Week 14 after torching the Commanders to the tune of five catches, 157 yards, and two TDs. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Eagles) and the Cowboys look to avenge their road loss to the Eagles in Week 9, as Dallas' WR1 routinely has double-digit reception potential.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown (@ Bears) was relatively quiet this past week, but he's likely to rebound against a Bears defense that he totaled nine catches for 95 yards against in Week 11. A.J. Brown (@ Cowboys) reached the century mark for the first time in four games in Week 13, and another high-usage day looks to be in store for a potential shootout.\n\nKeenan Allen (vs. Broncos) caught just five-of-nine targets last week, but as L.A.'s only reliable receiving option, a get-right game feels likely this week. Justin Jefferson (@ Raiders) is set to suit up for the first time since Week 5, and as we alluded to earlier, he's a must-start whenever he's active.\n\nStefon Diggs (@ Chiefs) hasn't totaled 100-plus receiving yards in any of his past six games, but he has every chance to get back on track against a Chiefs coverage unit that showed some leaks in Sunday's loss to the Packers.\n\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\n\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nWho are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?\n\nElijah Moore (vs. Jaguars), Noah Brown (@ Jets), Odell Beckham Jr. (vs. Rams), Jonathan Mingo (@ Saints), and Xavier Gipson (vs. Texans) are our preferred waiver-wire pickups in PPR formats for Week 14.\n\nMoore (vs. Jaguars) just saw 12 targets from Joe Flacco and is in line for another high-usage day with Amari Cooper (concussion) potentially sidelined. Brown (@ Jets) should also see a steady target share after Tank Dell's (leg) season-ending injury.\n\nBeckham Jr. (vs. Rams) is also likely to see increased usage with Mark Andrews (leg, ankle) done for the regular season. Mingo (@ Saints) has seen six-plus targets in his past four games, as his rapport with Bryce Young is strengthening by the week. Gipson led the Jets in receiving this past week (five receptions, 77 yards), and with New York routinely playing from behind, similar stat lines could be in the works.\n\nWEEK 14 DFS:\n\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\n\nWho are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 14?\n\nIt's tough to trust Calvin Ridley (@ Browns), Drake London (vs. Buccaneers), Jordan Addison (@ Raiders), and Jayden Reed (@ Giants) this week. Although Ridley has produced of late, a brutal matchup against a Browns coverage unit that entered Week 13 allowing the second-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to WRs raises a red flag, and it's only compounded by the loss of Trevor Lawrence (ankle). London's week-to-week output is way too unpredictable, and with the fantasy season on the line for some of you, there's no reason to roll London out.\n\nAddison is likely to take a step back with Jefferson back in the fold, while the Packers' receiving situation is too dispersed to put faith into Reed in PPR formats, though he might get a boost with Christian Watson (hamstring) banged up.\n\nWhat are the biggest WR injuries in Week 14?\n\nIn Week 13, Demario Douglas (concussion) and Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missed game action, and Tank Dell (leg), Amari Cooper (concussion), Christian Watson (hamstring), and Marquise Brown (heel) exited early from their respective games.\n\nUPDATE: Christian Kirk suffered a groin injury on Monday night, and he figures to be more doubtful than questionable for this week's game against Cleveland. If he's out, Zay Jones and Tim Jones will see more targets, but with Trevor Lawrence (ankle) also hurt, it's tough to count on either.\n\nUPDATE: Douglas (concussion) has been ruled OUT for Week 14.\n\nAs usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.\n\nFantasy WR PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at wide receiver\n\nRankings based on full-point PPR scoring formats\n\nRank Player\n\n1 Tyreek Hill, Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n2 CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n\n3 Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions @ Bears\n\n4 A.J.

Only one week stands between now and the fantasy football playoffs, so every decision we make could be the difference between an optimal finish and a womp-womp ending. Our Week 14 fantasy RB rankings for standard leagues will help steer your fantasy ship to the smoothest possible sailing, guiding you to the running back studs, sleepers, busts, and injuries of note going into the most important week of the regular season.\n\nThe rollercoaster that the 2023 season has been rolled on through Week 13, with yet another fresh batch of injuries. Luckily for us, we have strong stomachs (and we're not above taking offers from potential sponsors, TUMS and Kaopectate!). So, like always, we will navigate through the injuries to provide you with the most up-to-date information and analysis.\n\nLet's get to our Week 14 RB rankings and hopefully help you close out the regular season in style. Good luck, check back often, and enjoy the remainder of the first week of December!\n\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 14?\n\nAfter a six-team byepocalypse in Week 13, only the Cardinals and Commanders will be off this coming weekend. That takes lead backs Brian Robinson Jr. and James Conner off the table, plus Antonio Gibson for those in deep leagues.\n\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nOne thing that stinks for fantasy is that both Washington and Arizona have been defensive turnstiles. Many of the stud running backs have tough matchups in Week 14, but it's only right that many of the elite backs must beat the best defenses to lift fantasy squads to the big dance.\n\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 14?\n\nChristian McCaffrey (vs. Seahawks in Week 14) retains his spot at No. 1, especially considering he's playing at home against a Seattle team he just roughed up for 139 yards and two TDs on Thanksgiving. We're also sticking with Austin Ekeler (vs. Broncos) even though he has managed just 2.99 yards per carry since returning from injury just eight games ago. If Denver's abysmal run D doesn't cure what ails him, Ek's getting demoted for the fantasy playoffs.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. (@ Browns) draws a tough matchup on paper, but the Rams' Kyren Williams (@ Ravens) might beg to differ. Williams put 112 total yards and a TD on Cleveland in Week 13, and with Etienne's usage rate and the Jags hitting their stride offensively as of late, we're confident in the third-year back's ranking at No. 3.\n\nWe have two sets of teammates in our top 10 this week: Detroit's David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (@ Bears) and Miami's Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane (vs. Titans). Both duos have such solid workloads in high-flying, run-first offenses \u2014 and such juicy matchups \u2014 that we can't imagine any of these studs finishing outside the elite eight. DMont and Gibbs combined for 193 yards and two TDs when they faced Chicago in Week 11. Tennessee just surrendered 31 points to Indy, so we know Miami will be dominating the time of possession and running early and often against Will Levis and company.\n\nJets fans will be hoping for some Breece Lightning from stud second-year back Breece Hall (vs. Texans), and we think they will be rewarded for their patience. Houston has surrendered 111.8 scrimmage yards per game to RBs this season, and DeMeco Ryans' unit has also allowed 14 total rushing TDs on the year. We like Hall's upside even more than we like stud dual-purpose backs Alvin Kamara (vs. Panthers) and Saquon Barkley (vs. Packers), but just barely. Kamara and Barkley both have strong matchups, with Carolina and Green Bay both sitting in the bottom 10 in the NFL in standard fantasy points allowed to RBs.\n\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\n\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?\n\nWe'll talk more about Derrick Henry (concussion) in the injury section, but we can say with confidence here and now that Tyjae Spears (@ Dolphins) should be the hottest waiver-wire pickup of Week 14. Tennessee is a run-first offense and King Henry might be sidelined with a head injury, so Spears could very well pick up where he left off against Indy last weekend. The young back averaged 4.7 yards per carry (just shy of his 5.1 YPC entering the week) en route to 88 yards.\n\nAnother backup getting a boost this week is the Patriots' Ezekiel Elliott (@ Steelers), who will assume lead-back duties after Rhamondre Stevenson went down with a pretty bad ankle injury in Week 13. Zeke might put in a vintage performance considering James Conner just went back to Pittsburgh and hung 105 yards and two TDs on his old squad.\n\nCould this be the weekend that Keaton Mitchell (vs. Rams) gets back into RB2 range for the Ravens? Los Angeles might find itself spying Lamar Jackson and Gus Edwards so often that the speedy rookie busts a couple of big runs. Mitchell has racked up 330 yards and two TDs since he broke out four games ago, but the majority of that damage (134 yards and a TD) came in the initial breakout against Seattle. He has still yet to see 12 touches in a game, something we can't imagine will be the case by the end of the regular season.\n\nWe also think Roschon Johnson (vs. Lions) could have a chance to take over lead-back duties in Chicago, as both Khalil Herbert and D'Onta Foreman have battled injuries and inconsistent touches this season. It's a tough matchup, so temper your expectations, but there's some high-floor flex appeal considering Alvin Kamara and Taysom Hill averaged 5.2 yards per touch and found the end zone three times via the ground against Detroit last week.\n\nWEEK 14 DFS:\n\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\n\nWho are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 14?\n\nWe're a tad worried about Buffalo second-year back James Cook (@ Chiefs), as Kansas City's front-seven tends to be stout against speedsters but below-average against power backs. You probably aren't in a position to bench Cook, but don't expect massive numbers from the guy who averaged just 2.7 yards per carry against the Eagles his last time out.\n\nZach Charbonnet (@ 49ers) faces a tough matchup and has a bruise on his knee, so we don't expect very fruitful results from the rookie if he starts in Santa Clara this weekend. We also don't love Jerome Ford or Kareem Hunt (vs. Jaguars), as Jacksonville entered Week 12 allowing just 12.3 standard fantasy points per game to RBs (third lowest in the NFL).\n\nWe say it almost every week, but the song remains the same: don't start Carolina backs Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Saints). It's even worse than usual this week, as New Orleans has a pretty hard-hitting front-seven and the Bayou is no place for below-average offenses.\n\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 14?\n\nTwo-time rushing champ Derrick Henry (head) suffered a huge blow to the head and neck area in Tennessee's Week 13 loss to the Colts, so don't be surprised if the king gives up his throne to Tyjae Spears this week. He immediately left the game and proceeded to the locker room following the hit, and it was confirmed that he would not return with a head injury. It wouldn't make much sense for a four-win team to rush back its franchise player.\n\nPatriots dual-purpose back Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) suffered an injury on a nasty hip-drop tackle in New England's Week 13 loss to the Chargers. Bill Belichick and company already noted that 'Mondre would miss multiple weeks, so we're bumping Ezekiel Elliott way up against the Steelers.\n\nD'Andre Swift took a hard hit and exited Philadelphia's game late against the 49ers, but it's tough to know if he's actually hurt or was just kept out because of the lopsided score. If Swift can't go in Week 14 against Dallas, Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott will split touches, with Gainwell likely garnering flex value.\n\nJonathan Taylor underwent thumb surgery last week and is expected to miss a few weeks. Tough for Taylor owners to ride the home stretch of the regular season without JT, but at least they could get him back for the end of the fantasy playoffs. The injury highlights the importance of handcuffs, as Zack Moss has put up multiple top-10 performances with and without Taylor this season.\n\nSeattle's Kenneth Walker III (oblique) missed Week 12 and 13, and we're not confident in his ability to suit up against the hard-hitting 49ers coming off a big win in Philly. Backup Zach Charbonnet exited early because of a knee injury against the Cowboys, putting his status in doubt, too. If both are out, DeeJay Dallas would start and lead the backfield in touches.\n\nGreen Bay's Aaron Jones has a sprained MCL, and sources have revealed that the Packers continue to consider him week-to-week. He only logged four carries before sustaining the injury in Week 11, then he sat for the Packers' Thanksgiving Day tilt with the Lions and their Sunday Night Football win over Kansas City. Why rush him back if Green Bay is already winning games?\n\nD'Onta Foreman (ankle) missed Chicago's game before the bye, and his status remains unclear heading into Week 14. If he's healthy, he'll likely start in Chicago's backfield, but it's anyone's guess how carries will be divvied up after Roschon Johnson surprisingly led the way in Week 12.\n\nWe'll be updating these standard RB rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.\n\nFantasy RB Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at running back\n\nRankings based on standard, non-PPR scoring\n\nRank Player\n\n1 Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks\n\n2 Austin Ekeler, Chargers vs. Broncos\n\n3 Travis Etienne, Jaguars @ Browns\n\n4 David Montgomery, Lions @ Bears\n\n5 Raheem Mostert, Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n6 De'Von Achane, Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n7 Breece Hall, Jets vs. Texans\n\n8 Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions @ Bears\n\n9 Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers\n\n10 Saquon Barkley, Giants vs. Packers\n\n11 Tony Pollard, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n\n12 Bijan Robinson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n\n13 Derrick Henry, Titans @ Dolphins\n\n14 Kyren Williams, Rams @ Ravens\n\n15 Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. VIkings\n\n16 Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n\n17 Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Colts\n\n18 D'Andre Swift, Eagles @ Cowboys\n\n19 Javonte Williams, Broncos @ Chargers\n\n20 Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks @ 49ers\n\n21 Jaylen Warren, Steelers vs. Patriots\n\n22 Jerome Ford, Browns vs. Jaguars\n\n23 Alexander Mattison, Vikings @ Raiders\n\n24 Najee Harris, Steelers vs. Patriots\n\n25 Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots @ Steelers\n\n26 Gus Edwards, Ravens vs. Rams\n\n27 James Cook, Bills @ Chiefs\n\n28 Zack Moss, Colts @ Bengals\n\n29 Keaton Mitchell, Ravens vs. Rams\n\n30 AJ Dillon, Packers @ Giants\n\n31 Dameon Pierce, Texans @ Jets\n\n32 Aaron Jones, Packers @ Giants\n\n33 Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Chiefs vs. BIlls\n\n34 Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs vs. Bills\n\n35 Roschon Johnson, Bears vs. Lions\n\n36 Tyjae Spears, Titans @ Dolphins\n\n37 Kareem Hunt, Browns vs. Jaguars\n\n38 Tyler Allgeier, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n\n39 Chuba Hubbard, Panthers @ Saints\n\n40 D'Onta Foreman, Bears vs. Lions\n\n41 Devin Singletary, Texans @ Jets\n\n42 Dalvin Cook, Jets vs. Texans\n\n43 Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks @ 49ers\n\n44 Chase Brown, Bengals vs. Colts\n\n45 D'Ernest Johnson, Jaguars @ Browns\n\n46 Miles Sanders, Panthers @ Saints\n\n47 Joshua Kelley, Chargers vs. Broncos\n\n48 Royce Freeman, Rams @ Ravens\n\n49 Jaleel McLaughlin, Broncos @ Chargers\n\n50 Jeff Wilson Jr., Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n51 Ty Chandler, Vikings @ Raiders\n\n52 Justice Hill, Ravens vs. Rams\n\n53 Khalil Herbert, Bears vs. Lions\n\n54 Latavius Murray, Bills @ Chiefs\n\n55 Cordarrelle Patterson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n\n56 Kenneth Gainwell, Eagles @ Cowboys\n\n57 Tank Bigsby, Jaguars @ Browns\n\n58 Rico Dowdle, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n\n59 Samaje Perine, Broncos @ Chargers\n\n60 Matt Breida, Giants vs. Packers\n\n61 Chase Edmonds, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n\n62 Boston Scott, Eagles @ Cowboys\n\n63 Jamaal Williams, Saints vs. Panthers"

    "body": "If your startup doesn\u2019t seem impossible at first, it\u2019s not hard enough\n\nWelcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nStartups exist to solve complex problems, not to be a quick moneymaking scheme, and their success lies in their unique value proposition. The harder the problem a startup is tackling, the stronger their competitive advantage and the more indispensable they become in their industry. Simple solutions are easily replicated, risking the startup\u2019s position and success.\n\nThe key to a successful startup lies in its team and their ability to answer pivotal questions about the startup\u2019s purpose and challenges. Working on a difficult startup problem can bring industry recognition, ease sales and marketing efforts, and open the door to charging more for your premium product. In short: If startup seems like an easy win, the founders are likely overlooking something, I argue in my most recent column. Solve something that could at first seem impossible, and you may be on the right path. If there isn\u2019t a very real chance of failure, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nOn that lighthearted rant, here\u2019s what\u2019s been cookin\u2019 in the world of startups at TechCrunch this week!\n\nSomeone call security\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been paying attention to what our cybersecurity team has been covering, you have been missing out. Zack, Lorenzo, and Carly are absolutely crushing it. Allow me to make an impassioned plea for not missing their work.\n\nWhen you think \u201cessential services,\u201d you might think water, electricity, and hospitals \u2014 but internet connectivity is increasingly important as the infrastructure that ties together the fabric of society. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, internet connectivity in Gaza took a severe hit. Palestinian internet service provider NetStream reportedly collapsed due to a severe shortage of fuel supplies, while other providers such as Paltel and Mada Al Arab are also facing serious connectivity issues. Although the situation remains precarious, connectivity eventually was partially restored. There are indications that the U.S. government is putting pressure on Israel to restore internet connectivity in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile in India, Apple has notified several prominent Indian lawmakers and journalists of potential state-sponsored attacks on their iPhones, just months ahead of the country\u2019s general elections. The individuals targeted include opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, key Congress party figure Shashi Tharoor, and leaders from several other influential political parties.\n\nAtlassian issued a warning about a critical security flaw that could result in significant data loss for its customers. Notably, this product was recently the target of Chinese state-sponsored hackers. Atlassian has not yet detailed how the flaw can lead to data loss but has urged customers to patch against the flaw immediately.\n\nThere\u2019s more:\n\nAbout flippin\u2019 time, too: Apple has recently fixed a longstanding vulnerability in its iOS software that undermined a privacy feature. Security researchers found that the feature, introduced in iOS 14, was not working as intended.\n\n$400 million security acquisition: At a time when the tech industry in Israel is disrupted due to political events, Palo Alto Networks is acquiring Israeli tech company Dig Security for an estimated $400 million. This acquisition will bolster Palo Alto\u2019s cloud security-focused Prisma business.\n\nI guess we gotta pay up: Paying off hackers in the event of a ransomware attack is pretty common practice, but it comes with a ton of pitfalls: You are trusting anonymous criminals to do what they promised, and you may potentially be violating U.S. sanctions laws along the way.\n\nWhat\u2019s brewing on the silicon farm?\n\nApple\u2019s \u201cScary Fast\u201d October event saw the announcement of their new M3 chip lineup that includes M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips, which were the highlight of the event, will be integrated into the new 24-inch iMac and the new MacBook Pros. The focus of the M3 chips is enhanced graphical capabilities. Compared to the previous M1 chip, Apple asserts that the M3 renders at 2.5 times the speed and has a CPU that is 30% faster. The event\u2019s videos looked great (of course they did \u2014 they were produced by Apple), but one delightful quirk was that they were all shot on iPhones, showing off that the phones are becoming more and more capable, even for professional work.\n\nMagic Leap, an augmented reality hardware company, has replaced its CEO Peggy Johnson with Ross Rosenberg, marking the completion of its enterprise pivot. Johnson joined Magic Leap in August 2020 and led the shift in business strategy. Her successor previously served as executive at Belden and First Solar, and will now guide the company through its next period, as the company faces the daunting challenge of achieving profitability.\n\nMore from hardware land:\n\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane?: Shield AI, a startup specializing in autonomous flying systems for the U.S. military, has raised $200 million in a new funding round, reaching a valuation of $2.7 billion.\n\nEero grows up, with best-in-class Wi-Fi: Amazon\u2019s Eero has launched its most advanced mesh Wi-Fi router yet, the Eero Max 7.\n\nBoksing claver: Danish startup Soundboks released its fourth-generation Bluetooth speaker that has been a hit in Europe\u2019s festival scene but has yet to gain a strong foothold in the U.S. market.\n\nHighs and lows in the world of startups\n\nThe current bear market in cloud stocks has led to a reversal of revenue multiples from earlier this year, making it difficult for late-stage startups to accrue value, Alex writes on TC+. However, early-stage startups that are growing rapidly may still be able to raise funds and demand for a better valuation. The trend points toward a favorable environment for startups prioritizing growth over cash preservation.\n\nAt the same time, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if WeWork ends up filing for bankruptcy (TC+). The company has been grappling with significant challenges. WeWork\u2019s stock hit a new low, dropping over 47% after hours to just $1.21, which brings the company\u2019s market cap down to a mere $121 million. This is a drastic fall from the $47 billion valuation it achieved after its SoftBank-led Series H round in early 2019.\n\nHope for the best, prepare for the worst: Startup co-founders don\u2019t always make it, and in her fantastic TC+ piece, Rebecca explores what you can do to prepare today, should a co-founder breakup be on your startup journey\u2019s path.\n\nBumper banking backing in Brazil: Brazilian startup QI Tech, a banking-as-a-service platform, has raised $200 million in a Series B funding round, marking the largest raise in Brazil this year across all sectors. The latest funding round brings QI Tech\u2019s total capital raised to $262 million.\n\nNew Web Summit CEO appointed: Former Wikimedia Foundation CEO Katherine Maher has been appointed as the new CEO of Web Summit, following the controversial departure of its previous leader, Paddy Cosgrave. Maher\u2019s appointment comes as the tech conference faces a challenge to rebuild relationships and trust within the tech community.\n\nTop reads on TechCrunch this week\n\nShinier, smarter maps: Google is rolling out a variety of updates for Maps, incorporating AI technology to enhance user experience. The feature is currently available in France, Germany, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., with plans for further expansion.\n\nFrom stop-and-start to charging ahead: Over on TC+, Tim has had it with U.S. automakers hesitating on EVs, as Ford and GM are showing signs of backing away from their commitment to electric vehicles. Cowards.\n\nA swan song from the bird sanctuary: X has marked its value at $19 billion, according to internal documents, marking a 56% decrease in value since Elon Musk\u2019s purchase last year. Bad for shareholders and Musk, but potentially good for executives and employees, Amanda explains."

    "body": "Just when you thought the Chiefs were going to march into MetLife Stadium and cruise to a victory, the Jets threw a vicious counterpunch to make for an interesting \"Sunday Night Football\" game.\n\nTrailing by as much as 17 points, New York was able to tie the game at 20 heading into the fourth quarter. The Chiefs took the lead on a field goal early in the final frame and a crucial turnover from Jets QB Zach Wilson eventually decided the fate of the game as Kansas City did not give the ball back to earn the win, 23-20.\n\nChiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes did not have his best game \u2014 throwing for just 200 yards and one touchdown to two interceptions \u2014 but he made clutch plays in the game's biggest moments to come away with a victory. Wilson had one of his best games as a pro, throwing for 245 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nDespite the commotion surrounding Taylor Swift's attendance, Travis Kelce had a relatively quiet game with six receptions for 60 yards. Instead, the Chiefs offense was powered by RB Isiah Pacheco who rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIf you missed any action from a back-and-forth \"Sunday Night Football\" game, The Sporting News had you covered with live updates, highlights and more.\n\nChiefs vs. Jets final score\n\n1 2 3 4 F Chiefs 17 3 0 3 23 Jets 0 12 8 0 20\n\nChiefs vs. Jets results, highlights from 'Sunday Night Football'\n\nAll times are Eastern.\n\nFinal: Chiefs 23, Jets 20\n\n11:16 p.m.: Patrick Mahomes with a heads-up play. The star QB scrambled for a first down and could have trotted into the end zone untouched, but elected to slide at the one-yard line and put a bow on this game. The Chiefs are going to come away with a tightly contested victory.\n\n11:13 p.m.: We have hit the two-minute warning. The Jets burned all of their timeouts and the Chiefs have the ball on the NYJ 11 facing a 3rd & 8. New York's comeback hopes hinge on this next play.\n\n11:06 p.m.: The Jets intercepted Patrick Mahomes on 3rd & 20 but a controversial defensive holding call gives the ball back to the Chiefs with an automatic first down. Jets head coach Robert Saleh is letting the officiating crew hear it after that crucial call. There is 4:29 remaining in the game.\n\n11:02 p.m.: What a play from Patrick Mahomes! The Chiefs faced a 3rd & 22 and Mahomes saw an opening to run up the middle, taking off for a 24-yard gain to pick up a massive first down.\n\n10:55 p.m.: FUMBLE! Zach Wilson tried to drop back before he had full control of the snap and he fumbled. Chiefs DT Tershawn Wharton was quick to react, jumping on the ball to gain possession for Kansas City. The Chiefs will take over from NYJ 47 with 7:24 remaining in the game.\n\nChiefs 23, Jets 20\n\n10:48 p.m.: FIELD GOAL. Harrison Butker hits a 26-yard chip shot to put the Chiefs back in front. The Jets' defense held strong on 3rd & 9 inside their own 15 yard line to put an end to a 14-play, 80-yard drive by Kansas City. There is 10:51 to play in the game.\n\n10:45 p.m.: The Chiefs are in the red zone. Patrick Mahomes has completed seven passes on this drive alone to march Kansas City into New York territory. The Chiefs are down to the Jets' 13 yard line.\n\nEnd of third quarter: Chiefs 20, Jets 20\n\n10:41 p.m.: Patrick Mahomes is trying to get a drive going. The Chiefs have picked up 28 yards on six plays as we head into the fourth quarter. They will start the final period on their own 40 yard line.\n\n10:36 p.m.: The Chiefs' defense came up with a stop on 3rd & 11, forcing the Jets to punt. Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City will take over from its own 12 yard line.\n\n10:32 p.m.: Jets RB Breece Hall breaks out a 43-yard run to start the drive! And just like that, New York is into opponent territory on the KC 42.\n\n10:24 p.m.: The Jets give the ball right back to the Chiefs following a three-and-out of their own. Kansas City takes over from its own 12 yard line with 7:28 to play in the third.\n\n10:19 p.m.: The Jets have all the momentum now. The Chiefs go three-and-out after Patrick Mahomes failed to connect with WR Marques Valdes-Scantling on a deep pass on 3rd & 16. New York will take over from its own 47 yard line after an 11-yard punt return from Xavier Gipson.\n\nChiefs 20, Jets 20\n\n10:14 p.m.: TWO-POINT CONVERSION. Zach Wilson scrambled and dove into the end zone to complete the attempt. We have a tied ball game.\n\n10:13 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Zach Wilson to Allen Lazard on a 10-yard pass. The Jets QB is catching fire, leading a seven-play, 75-yard drive to open up the second half.\n\n10:09 p.m.: Zach Wilson has the Jets' offense moving! He found TE Ty Conklin on a 25-yard pass to get the second half started, then dished a 12-yard pass to WR Allen Lazard to pick up back-to-back first downs.\n\nHalftime: Chiefs 20, Jets 12\n\n9:53 p.m.: Things you'd have to see to believe: Zach Wilson outplaying Patrick Mahomes in the first half.\n\nWilson is 18-for-26 with 141 yards, one passing touchdown, zero interceptions and a 95.2 QBR. Mahomes is 8-for-16 with 135 yards, one passing touchdown, two interceptions and a 60.2 QBR.\n\n9:52 p.m.: The Jets attempted a Hail Mary to end the half but Zach Wilson was sacked by Chiefs DE Chris Jones.\n\n9:49 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Jets LB CJ Mosley picks off Patrick Mahomes on the first play of the drive. He was looking at TE Travis Kelce on a 35-yard pass but Mosley read it perfectly and Mahomes underthrew his target. The Jets take over from their own 35 with two timeouts and 18 seconds on the clock.\n\n9:46 p.m.: MISSED FIELD GOAL. Greg Zuerlein's 52-yard attempt hits off the upright to bring a disappointing end to the Jets' drive. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs will have 26 seconds and two timeouts from their own 34 to try and make something happen before the end of the half.\n\n9:43 p.m.: Zach Wilson is marching the troops! The Jets QB is putting together an impressive two-minute drill. He has led an eight-play, 41-yard drive to bring the Jets to Kansas City's 34 yard line.\n\nChiefs 20, Jets 12\n\n9:36 p.m.: FIELD GOAL. Harrison Butker knocks in another 37-yarder to keep the Chiefs in front with 2:15 remaining in the half. The Jets' pass rush put the pressure on Patrick Mahomes on 3rd & 2 and came up with a huge stop in the red zone.\n\n9:33 p.m.: Isiah Pacheco was pacing the Chiefs' drive, picking up 34 yards on the ground.

Zach Wilson to TE CJ Uzomah for a one-yard pitch and catch on the goal line. Wilson found WR Randall Cobb for a clutch first down on 3rd & 5 to keep the Jets' TD hopes alive, then delivered a dime to Uzomah to capitalize on the Chiefs' turnover.\n\n9:20 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Jets SS Ashton Davis picks off Patrick Mahomes on the first play of the drive and the tides are starting to turn in New York's favor. The Jets take over on Kansas City's 41 yard line.\n\nChiefs 17, Jets 5\n\n9:15 p.m.: FIELD GOAL. Jets K Greg Zuerlein buries a 31-yard field goal with 9:50 remaining in the half. Zach Wilson scrambled away on 3rd & 3 and found TE Ty Conklin open in the end zone but a low throw resulted in a dropped pass. New York was forced to settle for three points on its best drive of the game so far.\n\n9:12 p.m.: Get going, Zach Wilson! The Jets QB threw a dart to Garrett Wilson for 14 yards, followed by a 39-yard bomb to Allen Lazard to bring New York into Kansas City territory.\n\nChiefs 17, Jets 2\n\n9:09 p.m.: SAFETY! The Jets get on the board by way of a face mask penalty on Chiefs RT Jawaan Taylor in the end zone.\n\n9:05 p.m.: Zach Wilson connected with Ty Conklin for an 11-yard gain, but the Jets TE was still five yards short of the first down marker. New York was forced to punt the ball back to Kansas City, pinning the Chiefs inside their own 10.\n\nEnd of first quarter: Chiefs 17, Jets 0\n\n9:02 p.m.: Zach Wilson found Garrett Wilson on a 10-yard pass to pick up a first down on 3rd & 7 and keep the Jets' drive alive.

Patrick Mahomes finds TE Noah Gray wide open for a 34-yard TD to give the Chiefs a 17-0 lead. With too much attention on star TE Travis Kelce, Gray was able to escape free for his first touchdown of the season.\n\n8:47 p.m.: Jets RB Breece Hall ran for an 11-yard first down on the first play of the drive, but that was all New York's offense could put together. Zach Wilson's throw to TE Ty Conklin fell incomplete on 3rd & 1, forcing the Jets to punt again. The Chiefs will take over at their own 11 yard line with 6:12 to play in the first quarter.\n\nChiefs 10, Jets 0\n\n8:40 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Isiah Pacheco hardly even gets touched on a 48-yard carry for the first touchdown of the game. Chiefs' offensive lineman Trey Smith threw an incredible block as a pulling guard, clearing a runway for Pacheco to waltz into the end zone.\n\n8:34 p.m.: That's a quick three-and-out for the Jets' offense. New York came out throwing but Zach Wilson could only connect on one of three attempts to star WR Garrett Wilson. The Chiefs will take over from their own 31 yard line with 10:35 to play in the first.\n\nChiefs 3, Jets 0\n\n8:28 p.m.: FIELD GOAL. Harrison Butker gets the Chiefs on the board with a 37-yarder. Kansas City was moving the ball with little resistance on an eight-play, 57-yard drive before the Jets' defense held strong in the red zone.

    "body": "Prop bets are easy to understand and add a twist to most sporting events as you can bet on in-game events not tied to the outcome.\n\nProp bets are popular throughout the year and are posted for every major sport, but the pinnacle for prop betting is the Super Bowl. It\u2019s the most popular day of the year for prop bets, which range from the typical to the exotic.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for the Super Bowl to get involved in prop betting. See below for more on props, including the pros, cons, and prop bet examples from all the major sports.\n\nWhat is a prop bet?\n\nA prop bet is a \u201cside bet\u201d with a sportsbook on a specific event or statistical accomplishment within the game. These rarely have anything to do with the outcome of a game itself.\n\nFor example, you might bet on:\n\nLeBron James scoring over 20 points in a single game\n\nDallas Cowboys gaining over 300 receiving yards in a game\n\nPros and cons of prop bets\n\nEvery bet has positives and negatives, and prop bets are no different.\n\nPros\n\nThe lines don\u2019t usually move as fast as other bet types: Prop bet odds are developed based on game lines and totals at sportsbooks, but prop bet lines tend to adjust more slowly. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re keeping an eye on the New York Jets vs. the Buffalo Bills, and you see the total shift due to an incoming winter storm. While many bettors will scramble to get their bet in on the \u2018under\u2019 before the lines move too much, it\u2019s a good idea to scope out the prop bets for individual players. The main lines are shifting, but most of the best sports betting sites don\u2019t have the personnel to keep tabs on every possible player, so you could find value in an \u2018under\u2019 on a quarterback\u2019s passing yards because the lines haven\u2019t caught up yet.\n\nProp bet odds are developed based on game lines and totals at sportsbooks, but prop bet lines tend to adjust more slowly.

There\u2019s greater variety: The three main bet types\u2014moneylines, point spreads, and totals\u2014are constant in every major sport, but they don\u2019t offer a lot in the way of variety. Prop bets do. They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between.\n\nThe three main bet types\u2014moneylines, point spreads, and totals\u2014are constant in every major sport, but they don\u2019t offer a lot in the way of variety. Prop bets do. They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between. They are usually very easy to understand: Prop bets tend to ask a question of the bettor. Will a specific player hit a home run? Will Team X have over/under 3.5 field goals in a game? Will Team Y give up a powerplay goal? Whatever the question, prop bets are fairly easy to understand for the newcomer.\n\nCons\n\nProps are difficult to research: Prop bets are so specific you\u2019d think it would be easier to research them than other bet types, but the reality is that sports are extremely volatile. You can never truly predict how an athlete or a team will perform. This makes it very hard to nail down smart prop bets. For example, you could bet on a certain player to score \u2018over\u2019 a point threshold, but you lose because that player had an off-night, even though they might have easily won that bet in other recent games.\n\nProp bets are so specific you\u2019d think it would be easier to research them than other bet types, but the reality is that sports are extremely volatile.

Use most of your budget on more stable bet types, such as moneylines, spreads, or totals. Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend using prop bets as your main bet type when building your strategy. Use most of your budget on more stable bet types, such as moneylines, spreads, or totals. Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props. Exotic props are a guessing game: When large events like the Super Bowl roll around, you\u2019ll be inundated with exotic and entertaining prop bets. These are almost impossible to research, and pure guessing isn\u2019t good for anyone\u2019s bankroll or betting strategy.\n\nProp bet examples for major sports\n\nEvery major sport with odds at the best sports betting apps will have prop bets. Below, we give examples of prop bets you might find when betting on major American sports.\n\nNBA prop bets\n\nThe NBA offers a wide range of prop bets. They vary from player to team bets and lean heavily on the statistical side of the game. Some NBA prop examples include:\n\nHow many points a player will score\n\nNumber of assists or three-pointers a player will have\n\nWhich player will score the first basket of a game\n\nYou can also bet on team props, such as whether a team will lead at the end of a certain quarter or an over/under bet on the total number of points the team will score in the game.\n\nSee more: NBA prop bets\n\nNFL prop bets\n\nThe National Football League is the king of sports betting, and NFL betting sites have no qualms about showcasing every kind of possible bet type for it.\n\nBettors will find many prop bet opportunities, especially for the Super Bowl. During the regular season, one of the most popular prop bet options includes the \u201canytime touchdown scorer\u201d bet, where you can wager on a player to score a TD at any point in the game. Other prop bets can be focused on the team or even both teams.\n\nSee more: Super Bowl prop bets\n\nMLB prop bets\n\nMLB betting sites are no exception when it comes to offering prop bets. Like the other sports, MLB has prop bets focused primarily on individual players and statistical achievements like home runs, RBI, and strikeouts.\n\nYou might bet on an over/under for strikeouts for a starting pitcher in a game or even the number of bases a hitter will reach.\n\nNHL prop bets\n\nNHL betting sites have all of the props you\u2019d expect from one of the major North American sports leagues, such as player assists or a certain player scoring a goal in a contest.\n\nYou will also find bets for shots on goal, team goals in a game, and which team will score first.\n\nMLS prop bets\n\nThe demand for Major League Soccer betting has increased as the sport's popularity continues growing nationwide. Prop bets are just one of the many bet types growing at sportsbooks to keep up with the demand.\n\nAs expected, these prop bets often focus on individual players and their accomplishments, such as scoring a goal or collecting an assist in a game. Soccer betting sites also have props such as how many cards the two teams playing will combine to draw or a team\u2019s total number of corner kicks.\n\nHow to read prop bet odds\n\nProp bets at US sportsbooks use the same odds as other major bet types like moneylines, point spreads, and totals. These odds, known as American odds, use negative and positive numbers to show you how much money you stand to win.\n\nPositive odds show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. Let's say you wager on a quarterback to have over 2.5 touchdowns in a game at +145 odds, and he throws three in the game. If you wagered $100, you would be paid $245, your initial wager of $100 returned to you, plus $145 in winnings.\n\nNegative odds tell you how much you need to wager to win $100. For example, if you bet a player will score less than 15.5 points in a basketball game at -135 odds, you would need to bet $135 to win $100.\n\nRemember that you don\u2019t have to wager that high or that low. Your payout will be calculated proportionally to your wager size when you finalize your bet slip.\n\nWhat is an exotic prop bet?\n\nAn exotic prop bet is a non-traditional prop bet that is not focused on scenarios during a game. Instead, they can be as out of the ordinary as the sportsbook wants.\n\nIn the US, the most exotic bets are available during the Super Bowl, which is the most prominent sports betting day of the year and offers up hundreds of prop bets to interested bettors.\n\nThese bets can range from the number of songs sung during the halftime show to the result of the coin toss to the color of the sports drink dumped on the winning coach at the end of the game.\n\nFor the most part, you won\u2019t come across too many exotic prop bets when using US sportsbooks, as many are just not legal bets. However, the largest sporting events, such as the Super Bowl or March Madness, will find sportsbooks offering up a wider range of prop bets. That\u2019s usually when you\u2019ll find more exotic props.\n\nSportsbook rules for prop bets\n\nBefore placing any kind of bet, we highly recommend you read the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions. There, you will find all the rules for the various bets you will make.\n\nWhile most sportsbooks\u2019 rules are similar, there are always small variations in how they handle certain situations that could impact your bets.\n\nOne rule that is typically used by most sportsbooks involves player props. If you bet on a player and they don\u2019t play in the game, most sportsbooks void the bet and refund your wager. But if that player is involved in the game even for a single play, then the bet stands.\n\nWe recommend reading through the T&Cs before placing any wagers so you\u2019re not caught by surprise if an unexpected event should happen.\n\nRelated Pages:"

After a surprising loss to the Jets in Week 6 (their first of the season), Philadelphia went on a five-game winning streak, impressively taking down top teams like the Dolphins, Cowboys and Chiefs. Most of those games were gritty, close wins, but then the Eagles dropped back-to-back games in blowout fashion to the 49ers and Cowboys, raising alarm bells amongst the Philly fanbase.\n\nThe Eagles are looking to rebound against a Seahawks team that has been reeling even worse, losing four straight. Sitting four games behind the 49ers in the NFC West, despite a disappointing season, Seattle still has a shot at a wild card playoff spot. After tonight\u2019s game, the Seahawks\u2019 schedule eases up a bit, with winnable games against the Titans, Steelers and Cardinals. But they could really use a victory to give them some confidence going into the final stretch.\n\nPicks to consider"

    "body": "Lionel Messi's arrival at Inter Miami has brought with it a craze for fans to get a glimpse of one of the sport's most talented and legendary players of all time.\n\nAlong with that skyrocketing attention comes a leap in prices, and sadly the club seems to be passing that cost on to the supporters.\n\nIn 2024, Inter Miami will sport some of the world's most expensive tickets, rivaling the prices of Champions League giants such as Barcelona, Arsenal, and other massive clubs around Europe, while dwarfing other MLS ticket packages.\n\nWhile Fox Sports reported the club has an extensive waiting list for 2024 season tickets, the massive increase in price could push out many of the team's most dedicated supporters who have been with the team since its inception in 2020, causing massive turnover in the fanbase.\n\nA reminder that for most clubs, season-ticket packages include only home league matches, and while members usually get first access to purchase tickets for knockout competitions, those all come at an additional cost.\n\nInter Miami season tickets: Prices for 2024\n\nThe pricing structure for 2024 represents an enormous increase over the 2023 costs. The cheapest season ticket in 2023 was $485, but that will jump all the way to $884, which is an increase of 78.8%. There is a discount for fans who renew by October 7.\n\nMeanwhile, a season ticket in the lower-level midfield club area, which includes upscale food and beverage options, cost $3,600 in 2023 but will now run $7,650 for the 2024 season, an increase of 113%, more than doubling year-over-year.\n\nInter Miami 2024 season ticket prices\n\nPrices below courtesy of Inter Miami season ticketing release via the Miami Herald on September 28, 2023. Sections 2 through B are considered \"premium\" seating, while C through L are considered \"standard.\"\n\nCode Section Price 2 Mid Loge $45,900 3 North Loge $42,840 4 South Loge $42,840 5 Midfield Club $7,650 6 East Field Seats $13,005 A Northwest Prime $5,440 B Northwest Midfield $4,420 C West Sideline $2,720 D West Reserved $2,380 E East Midfield $2,635 F East Upper Midfield $2,125 G East Sideline $1,955 H East Reserved $1,360 I North Goaline $1,054 J South Goaline $1,020 K South Stand $867 L North Stand Reserved $884\n\nInter Miami season tickets among most expensive in world for 2024\n\nWith the Inter Miami season-ticket cost increasing by a huge margin over its own pricing model from 2023 to 2024, the club now boasts some of the most expensive seats in world football, also rivaling that of other major sports in the U.S.\n\nThe cheapest season ticket for Inter Miami in 2024 is $867, which works out to $51 per match across the 17 home games in the upcoming MLS season. Meanwhile, a seat in the West Reserved section, which puts a fan in the upper deck near the middle of the pitch, is now priced at a whopping $140 per match.\n\nAccording to Telemundo, this makes Inter Miami one of the most expensive tickets in the entire world. The cheapest Barcelona season ticket, for example, can be had for $377 for the season. Even while their prices are muted thanks to the next few seasons being played outside the under-construction Camp Nou, they are still just 25% cheaper than tickets to Barcelona's famed home ground.\n\nOne of Europe's most expensive tickets can be found at Tottenham, thanks in part to the brand new state-of-the-art Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and even then its cheapest ticket is around $974, while its most expensive package comes out to $2,498 for the year.\n\nThe most expensive premium packages at Inter Miami in 2024, which will run supporters over $45,000, dwarf any of the most luxurious tickets in the Premier League. The most expensive season ticket in the EPL can be found at Fulham, where the Craven Cottage luxury booths are valued at $3,620. Barcelona's most expensive season ticket is $1,826 for the full year.\n\nThe National Football League (NFL), the most popular sport in the United States by a massive margin, boasted an average ticket price of $112 in 2022, while the average NBA ticket price was $94 that year.\n\nThese prices also dwarf many other clubs in Major League Soccer. Orlando City SC, one of Inter Miami's chief in-state rivals, have their cheapest season ticket available for just $324 in 2024, over half the cost of any Inter Miami season ticket, while their most expensive premium ticket costs $2,898. Meanwhile, another nearby rival, Atlanta United, will feature its cheapest season ticket for $605 in 2024, or just $525 for founding members.\n\nInter Miami season-ticket glitch causes scare\n\nAlready, price increases have Inter Miami season ticket holders on edge, but a computer glitch saw supporters fed an even bigger scare.\n\nMike Ryan, a Miami local who regularly appears on the radio program The Dan LeBatard Show, posted on social media his shock when he received a 2024 renewal for $30,600 for his two seats, which in 2023 cost just $6,802. Ryan then posted a follow-up a few hours later that stated he was contacted by Inter Miami representatives who indicated that pricing was incorrect thanks to a computer glitch that sent supporters quotes for additional seats they did not actually have.\n\nStill, Ryan's follow-up indicated that his error quote was doubled in price over the actual cost, which still leaves his seats increasing from around $6,800 to a whopping $15,300 for two seats, an increase of 125% year-on-year."

    "body": "Manchester United would love a repeat of last season's 4-1 home win over Chelsea when the Blues visit Old Trafford this Wednesday.\n\nThe pressure on United has grown again following their lacklustre 1-0 defeat at Newcastle on Saturday and another setback against a Chelsea side \u2013 who beat Brighton & Hove Albion 3-2 the following day \u2013 would worsen the misery around Old Trafford.\n\nTwo heavyweights of world football, United and Chelsea are two of only seven teams to have won the modern Premier League and are only behind Liverpool when it comes to English success with European trophies.\n\nChelsea's recent record against United is poor, but they have won the Premier League twice since United last did so in the 2012/13 season and could exploit the poor form of Ten Hag's side here.\n\nThe Sporting News looks at a rivalry that stretches back decades and has been sharply in focus over recent years.\n\nMORE: Man United's incredible run of home cup draws\n\nMan United vs Chelsea head-to-head record, all-time results\n\nUnited have the edge in the historical head-to-head, helped by their run of seven wins and only one defeat in the first 12 meetings between the teams, from 1905 to 1913.\n\nOne of Chelsea's best runs in the fixture came after Roman Abramovich took over the club in 2004. From the start of the following season, United lost five and won one of the nine games between the teams.\n\nThe game has provided the FA Cup final on three occasions, Chelsea winning the most recent of those through Eden Hazard's penalty in 2018.\n\nHazard scored the only goal of the game to repeat the scoreline when Chelsea beat United in the final after extra time in 2007, avenging a 4-0 defeat to Sir Alex ferguson's side in 1994.\n\nArguably the most memorable game between the pair is the 2008 UEFA Champions League final, when United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar saved Nicholas Anelka's penalty to give his side victory following a 1-1 draw after extra time.\n\nMan United vs Chelsea all-time results (all competitions)\n\nGames Man United\n\nwins Chelsea\n\nwins Draws 193 82 55 56\n\nMan United vs Chelsea recent results\n\nAhead of their visit to Old Trafford in December 2023, Chelsea\u2019s most recent Premier League away win against Manchester United was a 1-0 win in May 2013.\n\nAt that point, they had won more Premier League games at Old Trafford (six) than any other side, but they proceeded to draw six and lose four of their next 10 trips to M16.\n\nManchester United are currently 11 Premier League games unbeaten against Chelsea since November 2017. However, the fact that seven of those matches ended all square has helped to make the game the most drawn fixture in Premier League history.\n\nSome 19 of those draws have featured goals for both teams. A 1-1 draw in the fixture is the most common exact scoreline in Premier League history, occurring 14 times.\n\nMORE: Is Raphael Varane leaving Man United?\n\nLast 10 matches between Chelsea and Man City\n\nCompetition Date Location Result Premier League May. 25, 2023 Old Trafford Man United 4-1 Chelsea Premier League Oct. 22, 2022 Stamford Bridge Chelsea 1-1 Man United Premier League Apr. 28, 2022 Old Trafford Man United 1-1 Chelsea Premier League Nov. 28, 2021 Stamford Bridge Chelsea 1-1 Man United Premier League Feb. 28, 2021 Stamford Bridge Chelsea 0-0 Man United Premier League Oct. 24, 2020 Old Trafford Man United 0-0 Chelsea FA Cup Jul. 19, 2020 Wembley Stadium Man United 1-3 Chelsea Premier League Feb. 17, 2020 Stamford Bridge Chelsea 0-2 Man United League Cup Oct. 30, 2019 Stamford Bridge Chelsea 1-2 Man United Premier League Aug. 11, 2019 Old Trafford Man United 4-0 Chelsea\n\nDo Man United vs Chelsea have a rivalry?\n\nAlthough the matches between United and Chelsea have tended to be closely contested, they do not have as fierce a rivalry as the Red Devils do with the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool, or the west London club holds with neighbours such as Tottenham and Arsenal.\n\nAbramovich's takeover gave Chelsea a new level of wealth that temporarily turned them into the dominant force in the English game, briefly supplanting United, who had won the title in eight of the previous 12 Premier League seasons.\n\nUnder the brash Jose Mourinho \u2013 an antagonist to his legendary United counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson \u2013 Chelsea embarrassed third-placed United in 2004/05, winning the trophy while finishing 18 points ahead of them and, at one point, forcing Ferguson's players to give them a guard of honour at Old Trafford because of the timing of their title win.\n\nUnited closed the gap to finish eight points behind Chelsea in second the following season, then returned to the top in 2006/07, the deposed champions coming six points short of their total.\n\nTwo points separated the teams as United won the Premier League again in 2007/08, and there would be one more changing of the guard to come when Chelsea finished first above United in 2009/10 \u2013 only for United to finish top a year later.\n\nThat ultra-tight Champions League final encapsulated how close the rivalry had become in a competitive sense, and both teams have won the Premier League since then, leaving United on a record 20 titles and Chelsea on six.\n\nChelsea have won the Champions League and Europa League twice each, while United have won the former trophy three times and the latter once.\n\nUnited's tally of 12 FA Cup triumphs is eight more than Chelsea have claimed, but both sets of supporters will be hoping their teams can become superpowers again after barren periods by their 21st-century standards.\n\nThe rise of mega-wealthy Manchester City to become arguably the best team in the world has not helped, and nor has Liverpool's resurgence under Jurgen Klopp. United finished well off the pace albeit in a respectable third at the end of 2022/23, a season in which Chelsea came 12th \u2013 their lowest final position for 29 years."

    "body": "They\u2019ll always have Paris. Throughout this Nations League campaign this has been an England team fighting its own sense of entropy, still giving everything, still trying the same plans and processes in the hope that eventually something would click. And at 9.34pm on a briskly cold Wembley night, it finally did. Ella Toone\u2019s injury-time goal earned England three points and kept their faintly glowing Olympic dream alive. But somehow it also did so much more.\n\nIt breathed life into a team and a cycle, and a moment that for so much of the evening had felt like it was drawing to its natural conclusion provided a rousing encore to a cast preparing for its final curtain. There will be new challenges and new frontiers to conquer soon enough, a fresh set of European Championship qualifiers in the spring, but for now this iteration of the Lionesses still has tricks up its sleeve, still has talent and creativity to burn, still has a fire that can scorch any team on the planet.\n\nAnd as they rallied so spectacularly to salvage a match that looked cooked after 35 minutes, running on fumes and adrenaline, sustained by the sizzle of the Wembley crowd, the cold air on their skin and the flickering candle of qualification for Paris next summer, it was as if a kind of energy was surging within them.\n\nAn energy that we have not really glimpsed from them since they reassembled this autumn, barely a month on from the trauma of Sydney, still a little dazed and concussed.\n\nBeth Mead came on for Chloe Kelly at half-time, Georgia Stanway moved further forward and made herself a menace in the penalty area, and the old buddies Toone and Alessia Russo teamed up off the bench. The Dutch retreated further and further into Wembley\u2019s wide open spaces, giving Lauren James the time and territory to dictate. James had a hand in all three goals, and as Toone ghosted in at the far post to provide the final flourish, Wembley screeched out one last call to arms, one last push, one last effort.\n\nFor all this, it is probably worth pointing out that for large parts of the game England were not very good. And we were reminded that for all their creativity and verve going forward perhaps the biggest flaw in this side is a lack of presence in the two penalty areas, the physicality and the alpha energy to do the grunt work, to convert the crosses and to head them away.\n\nJess Carter had a poor game and was withdrawn for Esme Morgan after half-time, Alex Greenwood over-committed for the first Dutch goal and even the all-conquering Mary Earps plummeted to Earth with a poor first-half error.\n\nBut beyond personnel, a basic brittleness seems to have crept into this team, a sense of melting surfaces and cracks in the ice. Sarina Wiegman talks a lot about defending against counterattacks, because this is basically the key to the whole enterprise. Cut off the counter, and with England\u2019s technical quality they can easily dominate. It is also the essential measure of how the team is functioning as a collective: the efficiency of the press, the closing of the angles, the command of space. Lineth Beerensteyn\u2019s two goals were the sort England simply were not conceding four months ago.\n\nMary Earps shows her frustration after conceding a second goal to the Netherlands. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nSo England passed the ball around a bit and gave it away a bit and essentially ran around trying to feel normal again, and on countless occasions Kelly or Hemp would win a first or second ball, look up and see a penalty area empty of white shirts. These are issues not so much of tactics but cohesion and energy: the timing of runs, the sharpness required not just to anticipate where the ball is going to be, but actually get there. You can still chase when you\u2019re running on fumes, but to create: this needs an idea and a vision, the clarity of mind to see the picture before it has materialised.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How much prestige should we really attach to the Nations League, anyway? Is it primarily an Olympic qualification shootout or something worth winning in its own right? England ended up trying to answer these questions on the hoof, and somehow it was only when their options had finally clarified down to one \u2013 survival or oblivion \u2013 that they recovered their poise and verve.\n\nThis entire post-pandemic international cycle \u2013 a Euros, a World Cup, an Olympics and another Euros squeezed into three years \u2013 feels like a kind of sadism dressed up as a panorama of opportunity. There is a school of thought out there that a fallow summer might not have been the worst thing for this team: time to reflect and process, time to breathe, time to refresh.\n\nInstead, they now travel to Glasgow on Tuesday for one last push. The minds are still frazzled. The bodies are screaming. But chaos and confusion has never felt quite so sweet."

    "body": "\u201cTackled above waist and below shoulders. No sling or double motion. Sheppard lands on her back. \u2032 \u2018Girls\u2019 play hard too,\u201d Harford said on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. This echoed Collingwood defender and Fox Footy commentator Ruby Schleicher\u2019s thoughts at the time, who called it a \u201cmonster tackle\u201d but believed it was \u201cfair\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see any dirtiness in that,\u201d Schleicher said on Fox Footy. \u201cIt was pretty heavy on her head, wasn\u2019t it? I look at that \u2013 I still see a fair tackle. There\u2019s no doubt the match review [officer] will look at it because they have to I guess. The duty of care for the player.\u201d\n\nThe decision a week comes after Adelaide premiership defender Najwa Allen was handed a three-ban suspension, the longest ban in AFLW history, for a high bump on Western Bulldog Kirsten McLeod. The Crows elected not to challenge the decision. \u2018Horror week\u2019: Bombers stunned by struggling, controversy-hit Eagles West Coast withstood a late-term surge from Essendon to narrowly claim their second win of the AFLW season.\n\nFresh off a controversy caused by comments their coach Michael Prior made following last week\u2019s 70-point loss to Melbourne, the Eagles prevailed 3.5 (23) to 2.7 (19) in a slugfest at the appropriately named Windy Hill on Sunday. West Coast\u2019s Kate Bartlett (left) and Isabella Lewis celebrate Sunday\u2019s surprise win over Essendon flanked by their teammates. Credit: Getty Prior had blasted the decision to pit strugglers West Coast against defending premiers Melbourne, saying: \u201cHow we play that team is beyond me. That is what you get when you get fixturing like that.\u201d He later backtracked on the criticism, but his comments did put added pressure and focus on his team this week. Michael Prior guided West Coast to a gutsy win. Credit: Getty\n\nAisling McCarthy and Amy Franklin drew first blood for West Coast within the opening five minutes, while the hosts were kept goalless. The Bombers only added three behinds in the second term and the Eagles failed to score as the blustery conditions took their toll on the game. West Coast\u2019s Kellie Gibson broke the goal drought with the only major of the third quarter, before the home side came to life with the wind at their backs in the final term, with skipper Bonnie Toogood and Amber Clarke reducing the margin to four points. Toogood continued to pepper the scoreboard, but the Eagles held on to secure a rare victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a horror week back at home, and it\u2019s been really bloody tough on all of us, and Mick as well. I\u2019m just really proud of the girls,\u201d West Coast captain Emma Swanson said post-game on the broadcast. \u201cI can name the whole team. Everyone had their second in the last couple minutes.\n\n\u201cThat was such a team effort, everyone had a moment there when they had to put their head over the footy and lay a tackle and not let it slip.\u201d Swanson (25 disposals, eight clearances) stood out for the Eagles, while Bombers workhorse Maddy Prespakis (30 disposals, nine clearances) was typically prominent in the midfield alongside Georgia Nanscawen (21, six). With two rounds left, West Coast have a chance to build their winning streak when they meet the bottom of the table Western Bulldogs next round. Slipping one place to sixth, Essendon have must-win matches against Carlton and Gold Coast on the road to the finals. The Bombers will be without Steph Cain, who was sidelined with a concussion after an elbow to the head from Swanson. AAP Pies hold on against comeback Cats\n\nSunday\u2019s clash between Collingwood and Geelong at Victoria Park was less about who was the overall better side than it was decided by who could adapt best to the blustery wind and rain. The answer: the Magpies. Collingwood survived a fourth quarter comeback from Geelong to finish with a six-point victory and stay firmly in finals contention, whereas the Cats now face an uphill battle to finish in the eight in two weeks\u2019 time. Jordyn Allen of the Magpies is tackled by Geelong\u2019s Claudia Gunjaca in the round-eight match at Victoria Park. Credit: Getty Geelong scored just one point in the first quarter and had just 1.3 on the board at three-quarter-time, but kicked two goals to none in the final term to close in on Collingwood. Magpies ruck Sabrina Frederick, who starred with 39 hit-outs and used her height to bring the ball to ground at the advantage of her midfielders, said her side had been practising for games like this.\n\n\u201cEven in the chaos, it\u2019s quite comfortable because we train it. We train what scenarios to do in what moments, and even though it\u2019s a bit crazy, it felt so calm. We put players in place and we know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Frederick. \u201cBut close games are good ones, for everyone. We knew they were going to come out like that [in the last quarter]. When they\u2019re down, they\u2019re just going to give us everything.\u201d Collingwood\u2019s Brianna Davey kicks her team forward against Geelong. Credit: Getty Frederick admitted at times she \u201ccouldn\u2019t see\u201d and felt like she could be \u201cblown away\u201d. Geelong coach Daniel Lowther said the strong winds made it hard for his side to clear the ball out of their defensive 50-metre zone and to move the ball with any certainty around the ground.\n\nLoading \u201cAt one point the rain hit our box, it was flowing,\u201d Lowther said. \u201cBoth teams had to fight in the conditions, but it didn\u2019t help the game. \u201cOur marking contest wasn\u2019t too flash, our ground ball representation was a bit hit and miss, so our defence were under a bit more pressure than they should have been, but they fought back really well,\u201d Lowther said. Collingwood next play a Sydney line-up including former Magpies star Chloe Molloy, while Geelong will take on Richmond at Ikon Park.\n\nDockers spoil Saints\u2019 finals hopes Fremantle recorded a comfortable 24-point win yesterday to bring an abrupt end to St Kilda\u2019s four-game streak and dash their AFLW finals hopes. J\u2019Noemi Anderson is tackled by a group of Dockers. Credit: AFL Photos The Dockers dominated the Saints from the start to win 6.9 (45) to 3.3 (21) at Fremantle Oval. Having been on the verge of making their first finals appearance, St Kilda (4-4) could now miss the top eight even if they beat the fourth-placed Brisbane Lions and the ninth-placed Carlton.\n\nDana East was everywhere for Fremantle, leading the game in disposals (19) and contested possessions (11), alongside Orlagh Lally (19 disposals, five clearances). Jamiee Lambert was the shining light for the otherwise subdued Saints, collecting a game-high seven clearances and 13 contested possessions. Docker Hayley Miller hunts a loose ball against St Kilda. Credit: Getty Fremantle flew out of the gates from the first siren, producing their highest-scoring quarter of the season with 26 points in the opening term. Conversely, the score was the most the Saints have conceded in any quarter this season.\n\nAine Tighe set the tone for the Dockers with a brilliant goal less than 30 seconds into the first quarter, followed by two majors from Gabby O\u2019Sullivan and another by Angelique Stannett. Ella Friend slotted a much-needed goal for the visitors to make it 4.2 (26) to 1.3 (9) at quarter-time. With less than a minute till the long break, captain Hayley Miller (two goals) kicked the only major of the second quarter to give Fremantle a comfortable 26-point lead at half-time. Despite two goals from Tyanna Smith and J\u2019Noemi Anderson in the second half, the Saints struggled to eat into the deficit. Fremantle (4-4) face reigning premiers Melbourne next, before finishing the season against 11th-placed Sydney.\n\nDogs forward reveals battle with kidney disease Western Bulldogs forward Richelle Cranston has revealed she\u2019s been living, and playing, with stage five chronic kidney disease. \u201cI still manage to do the things I love,\u201d the inaugural AFLW player posted to Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s just really hard sometimes.\u201d Richelle Cranston of the Bulldogs: \u201cIt\u2019s just really hard sometimes.\u201d Credit: Getty Images The 34-year-old posted the caption along with a video detailing her life with the disease including weekly blood tests and daily blood pressure checks, tracking water and food intake, taking medications including resonium (to lower potassium levels), all while training in the high-performance environment.\n\nThe Dogs are Cranston\u2019s third club after starting at Melbourne and having a stint with Geelong before heading to the Bulldogs last year. Cranston lined up for the Bulldogs in her side\u2019s 57-point loss to Sydney on Saturday at Whitten Oval, 14.12 (96) to 6.3 (39). It was the Western Bulldogs\u2019 eighth loss in a row, and their biggest-ever defeat, and they have just two rounds left to clinch a win this season. They next play 17th-placed West Coast and then top-four side North Melbourne. For the Swans, however, the victory has them challenging for a top-eight spot alongside the likes of Gold Coast, Geelong, Collingwood, St Kilda and Carlton.\n\nThe Swans, who went winless in their debut season last year, were propelled to victory by a Chloe Molloy masterclass. After a five-goal second term, which included a four-minute burst of three majors, Sydney had already brought up their largest score in an AFLW game by halftime. Swan Chloe Molloy celebrates a goal. Credit: AFL Photos / Getty Images The Bulldogs held their own in the last quarter, but the damage had already been done. The total was also the biggest the Dogs have conceded in their history, topping the 83 Melbourne kicked against them in round three. Molloy, the Swans\u2019 star off-season recruit, turned on one of the best performances of her career to demolish their injury-hit hosts.\n\nThe former Collingwood ace was a class above as she kicked 3.4 from her 28 possessions and played a crucial role in setting up numerous other Sydney goals. Loading \u201cShe [Molloy] was itching to get in there [in the midfield],\u201d Swans coach Scott Gowans said. \u201cWe kept her forward deliberately. It was important Chloe played a good block of time forward so we could have a look at it.\u201d The Blues lost to Greater Western Sydney by two points on Saturday afternoon, denying them the chance to leapfrog into the top eight, 8.1 (49) to 7.5 (47).\n\nNarrm reclaim top spot Reigning premiers Narrm have reclaimed top spot on the ladder and their position as flag favourites after defeating third-placed North Melbourne by 23 points at Ikon Park on Saturday night.

Credit: AFL Photos It was a hard-fought, low-scoring battle between the two powerhouse sides that play a similar game style. Each set up well, are fast and like a good dose of contested marking. But Narrm controlled more of the game by tightening around the contest and being cleaner going forward. They also defended extremely well by suffocating the opportunities North created and prevailed 5.7 (37) to 2.2 (14). While the Demons scored just one goal a quarter in the second half \u2013 Tyla Hanks in the third and Eden Zanker in the fourth \u2013 the Kangaroos were goalless for three terms, having led by five points at the first change. Their opening goals were thanks to Niamh Martin and Tess Craven.\n\nThen a crafty goal from Demons skipper Kate Hore to open the second term put her side up, and Melbourne never gave up the lead. Hanks was pivotal for the Demons and starred with 26 disposals, seven tackles and one goal, while her partner in the midfield Olivia Purcell had 28 touches, five clearances and five tackles. For the Roos, Ash Riddell led the disposal count with 31, while skipper Emma Kearney was crucial in defence. Melbourne\u2019s Alyssa Bannan is tackled by Lulu Pullar of the Kangaroos.

The Lions\u2019 Orla O\u2019Dwyer speeds away against the Crows. Credit: Getty Images Adelaide started fast but the game evened up as the Lions had the better of the second quarter with three goals to one. The Crows then took back control in the third with three goals to none, which set the stage for a tense final term. The fourth quarter was a heated arm wrestle, and scores were tied with four minutes left on the clock. The Lions\u2019 Bella Dawes kicked the only goal of the last term, but it was a series of behinds in the final minutes that won the game for them, including one from Lily Postlethwaite that broke the stalemate.\n\nAdelaide\u2019s Niamh Kelly navigates her way through traffic against brisbane. Credit: Getty The two sides have had intense battles in the competition\u2019s history, including two grand finals, and this was no different. If the Lions had lost, they were at risk of falling out of the top four with second-season side Essendon chasing their spot. Last season\u2019s best and fairest Ally Anderson said her side loved playing at its training ground in Springfield, which it has made a fortress, and work well in hot conditions . \u201cIt was really hot. It was a grind\u2026 But yeah, it was a good finish,\u201d Anderson told Fox Footy post-game. \u201cEvery week that we play here, every time that we play here, we get better and better. So, it was just a matter of time before we finally got the first win and then it hopefully [will] open the floodgates a bit.\u201d\n\nThe Lions next play St Kilda before taking on the reigning premiers Melbourne in the final round. After this weekend, they have staked their claim as being premiership contenders again. Adelaide will play top-four side North Melbourne next weekend before 18th-placed Western Bulldogs. Comeback kings Richmond take the points in Cairns A late goal by Emelia Yassir has helped Richmond to their first win in four games, putting their AFLW finals campaign back on track with an 11-point victory over Hawthorn. Tight tussle: Richmond\u2019s Emelia Yassir is tackled. Credit: Getty Images Separated by one point at half-time and down by nine points entering the last quarter, the Tigers pulled off a 6.5 (41) to 4.6 (30) victory to keep their finals hopes alive at Cazaly\u2019s Stadium in Cairns on Friday night.\n\nHawthorn were limited to just one point in the decisive final quarter. Midfield duo Monique Conti (35 disposals, seven clearances) and Grace Egan (28, 5) were typically influential for Richmond, while Hawthorn were led by Emily Bates (18, four) and Jasmine Fleming (18, one). \u201cRichmond were just absolute beasts, especially their midfielders. They really worked hard all night,\u201d Hawthorn coach Bec Goddard said after the game. \u201cOur work rate really dropped off and we just watched them play some really good footy. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Hawks fan, you would\u2019ve seen some really exciting moments of footy tonight.\n\n\u201cKeep getting excited. We are coming, we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re getting better.\u201d Hawthorn\u2019s Irish ace Aine McDonagh kicked the opening goal before Tigers skipper Katie Brennan slotted two unanswered majors to celebrate her 50th game in style. Fellow 50-gamer Greta Bodey put boot to ball to snatch her own goal before quarter-time. A skirmish erupted in the second term after Brennan took exception to a tackle by Mattea Breed on Laura McClelland. McClelland was gifted a 50-metre penalty following a bump against Sarah Hosking by Sophie Locke and converted from inside the goal square while players were occupied by the tussle.\n\nBridie Hipwell kicked the only goal of the third quarter to give Hawthorn a game-high nine-point lead. Loading Richmond rebounded in the last term, with Courtney Jones ending Hawthorn\u2019s three-goal run with her first touch of the night, cutting the margin to three points. Dogged by inaccuracy in front of goal, Yassir reduced the deficit to a single point before finally breaking through on her third attempt. That put the Tigers ahead by six points with 11 minutes left, before Caitlin Greiser sealed the win with a massive goal from 45 metres."

    "body": "Robin Williams' sudden death shocked the world in 2014, and now his friends and colleagues are giving an inside look into the years before he died by suicide.\n\nThe depth of Williams' drug use was highlighted in Vice's \"The Dark Side of Comedy\" documentary series. The comedian's episode marked the premiere of the show's second season.\n\nWilliams began his career in stand-up comedy in the 1970s and elevated his fame after appearing in an episode of \"Happy Days\" as an alien named Mork. The role led to his own TV series, \"Mork and Mindy.\" The comedian also landed a role in the film world with \"Popeye.\"\n\nWilliams' friends noted that while he loved being around people, he also \"cherished\" his alone time, and they began to see him struggle with his level of fame.\n\nSTARS WE'VE LOST IN 2023\n\n\"Robin's highs were so high and his lows were often low,\" his \"Mork and Mindy\" co-star Gina Hecht said during the documentary.\n\nDue to Williams' high-energy performance onstage, many speculated that the comedian had turned to cocaine, with some saying they would see the actor head to the back of The Comedy Store, where drugs were prevalent.\n\nWilliams' longtime friend Allan Stephan recalled a moment that led him to worry.\n\n\"He said, \u2018Know anybody with any blow? I have to go on. I can\u2019t go on without the blow.\u2019 And I sat down and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you,'\" Stephan claimed. \"He goes, \u2018You have blow?\u2019 I go, \u2018No, are you out of your f---ing mind? You\u2019re Robin Williams!\u2019\n\n\"And then I think after that he wouldn't get high when he had to perform.\"\n\nHowever, Williams continued to do drugs after his stand-up shows.\n\n\"When you did have that kind of fame, drugs were just given to you,\" Hecht noted.\n\nROBIN WILLIAMS' KIDS PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LATE ACTOR ON WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN HIS 72ND BIRTHDAY: \u2018LOVE YOU FOREVER\u2019\n\nFilmmaker and comedian Mike Binder recalled Williams' reaction to \"a gram of coke\" while the two were out in Hollywood in the '80s.\n\n\"Robin said, \u2018Let me take that. Do you mind if I grab a hit off that in the bathroom?\u2019\" Binder recalled in the documentary. \"He came back, and it was empty. It was like, \u2018Whoa.\u2019 It was like 8:15 at night.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, I'm sorry,\" Binder said the comedian responded after being called out for taking the entire gram.\n\n\"With drugs, he was a monster.\"\n\nWilliams began to weave cocaine into his stand-up jokes \u2014 which many laughed at, despite the light it shed on how deep the comedian was into his cocaine use.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times Robin came onstage at The Comedy Store and a big part of his routine was cocaine and the drugs that he had done,\" Howie Mandel recalled. \"And even though everybody was laughing, and it was really funny, he was really doing a lot of cocaine. He found the funny side of it, but ultimately it was real and really, it's not funny, but that's who he is.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nJohn Belushi's death in 1982 \"threw cold water\" on Williams, who had been close to the comedian. Belushi died from a drug overdose in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, California.\n\nBelushi's death, along with the birth of Williams' first son in 1983, really helped the comedian clean up his drug addiction, according to the documentary.\n\nWilliams quit cocaine \"cold turkey,\" his longtime friend Stanley Wilson said.\n\n\"He knew what an amazing instrument that he had, and that it is all related to his mind and his imagination and his wit,\" Wilson added. \"The more stuff you do to deaden that, the more you\u2019re going to burn some more brain cells. Robin didn\u2019t want to do that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nOnce he quit, Williams' career continued to grow \u2014 with him landing a show at The Met and other movie roles, including \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" \"Good Will Hunting\" and \"Night at the Museum.\"\n\nHowever, in the years before his death in 2014, the actor was unaware he was dealing with Lewy body dementia. Williams reportedly appeared tired while on set and didn't seem to be his usual self before he died by suicide on Aug. 11, 2014.\n\nThe comedian was diagnosed with the neurological disorder posthumously after an autopsy was performed. Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's. The disease affects brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe autopsy found no illegal drugs or traces of alcohol in Williams' system.\n\n\"The last time I saw Robin Williams, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a few months, and he was thin, and he didn\u2019t recognize my wife,\" Steven Pearl, a comedian and friend, said during the documentary. \"He hardly said a word. It took him a second to recognize me. I go, \u2018Whoa, something\u2019s wrong here.\u2019 I didn't know what. Nobody would really tell me. And then I never saw him again after that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"

Victor Ortiz blatantly headbutted \u2018Money\u2019 in 2011, got docked a point, then wanted to apologise by hugging it out.\n\nHowever, an angry Mayweather was having none of it and landed two cracking hooks while Ortiz had his hands by his side, knocking him out.\n\nThe ending sparked an argument between Mayweather and HBO analyst Larry Merchant, which ended with the 80-year-old proclaiming his desire to kick Floyd\u2019s ass.\n\nNot how anyone predicted this evening would end.\n\n7 Mayweather was headbutted by Ortiz, and so then knocked him out when he failed to protect himself Credit: Getty\n\n9. \u2018The Hitman\u2019 and the dad\n\nRicky Hatton was doing a number on Stephen Smith in his 30th fight when his elbow caught Smith and opened a cut.\n\nIt looked like an accident, but not to Smith\u2019s dad and cornerman, Darkie, who piled into the ring when his son went down and began shoving referee Mickey Vann.\n\nA disqualification followed, and considering it was in front of 15,000 fans in Manchester, the Smiths did well to make it back to the dressing room, just being pelted with cups filled with (hopefully) beer.\n\n\u201cBoxing used to be a clean and fair sport; it isn't any more,\" moaned Darkie.\n\n7 Hatton had an eventful night in 2002 Credit: Getty\n\n8. Hopkins KOd by referee\n\nUnsurprisingly, middleweight champ Bernard Hopkins was involved in an ugly, mauling fight against Robert Allen in 1998.\n\nBut referee Mills Lane\u2019s attempt to physically pull the clinching pair apart went badly wrong when he sent an off-balance Hopkins through the ropes and onto the floor.\n\nMaybe you just should have shouted \u2018break\u2019, Mills. It was a nasty spill, and Hopkins, lying ringside, claimed he was too injured to fight on.\n\nB-Hops joked he would \u2018sharpen my wrestling skills\u2019 for the rematch a year later, but this time, he knocked out Allen in round seven.\n\n7 The duo got to fight again in 2004\n\n7. KO in one second\n\nEfe Ajagba completed boxing in 2018, the then 5-0 heavyweight prospect beating Curtis Harper in the first second of round one.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even need to throw a punch as Harper waited for the opening bell, then calmly stepped between the ropes and strolled back to his dressing room.\n\nA baffled Ajagba celebrated his \u201cwin\u201d, while Harper later explained he was upset over a contract situation. You wonder why he bothered with the ring walk and referee\u2019s instructions.\n\nBut still, Ajagba got to 6-0 with an official KO1, 0:01. Harper has not fought since.\n\n6. Big Daddy goes WWE\n\nHow can a fight end with your opponent\u2019s manager dragging you over the top rope and out of the ring, only to finish up with you disqualified? Ask Elijah Tillery.\n\nThe heavyweight fought future world champ Riddick \u2018Big Daddy\u2019 Bowe in a bad-tempered bout in 1991. After the bell ended round one, Bowe landed a late jab in response to Tillery blowing him a kiss.\n\nTillery began kicking Bowe, and the pair brawled until Riddick\u2019s fiery manager, Rock Newman, leaned in from outside and hauled Tillery out of the ring via a crude WWE neckbreaker.\n\nAmid the chaos, the ref decided that Tillery\u2019s kicks were worthy of a DQ and called the insanity off.\n\n5. Kermit the Frog\n\nKermit Cintron had a pretty good career, crowned by a short stint as a welterweight world champion. Unfortunately, most boxing fans mainly recall him for just one thing: the unusual ending to his 2004 fight with Paul \u2018The Punisher\u2019 Williams.\n\nThe two got tangled up in round four, and while Williams fell to the canvas, Cintron dived head-first between the ropes and crashed into a table before hitting the floor. Pure momentum or oddly deliberate?\n\nEither way, when the Puerto Rican could not continue, the bout went to the scorecards, Williams winning while Cintron was carted away on a stretcher in a neck brace.\n\n7 Bowe was a fearsome heavyweight Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n4. TV camera stoppage\n\nIt may not have changed the end result, but Adolpho Washington can forever hold a grudge against ringside TV cameras. His 175lb world title challenge against Virgil Hill in 1993 ended when he went to sit down in his corner at the end of round 11, only for his swollen eye to hit an intrusive camera, causing a cut to open up.\n\nThe gash was so bad that the fight was called off, Hill declared a technical decision winner, and Washington denied the chance to go all-out in round 12. Chances are Hill was winning anyway, but stoppage via aggressive TV camera is surely unique in boxing history.\n\n3. McCall\u2019s tearful breakdown\n\nA hotly anticipated heavyweight world title fight, Lennox Lewis\u2019 attempt to avenge his upset defeat by Oliver McCall ended in a very different kind of \u2018upset\u2019 (the one where one boxer starts crying, stops throwing punches and eventually gets stopped for simply not trying).\n\nIron-chinned McCall battled drug addiction in the buildup to this 1997 bout and was arrested for throwing a Christmas tree across a hotel lobby.\n\nSo McCall was clearly not in the right mindset to trade leather with Lewis, as it showed when he began wandering around the ring in a world of his own.\n\nRef Mills Lane eventually just waved the bizarre spectacle off.\n\n7 McCall kept wandering off midway through the fight Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n2. Mrs Wilson\u2019s shoe\n\nBritish light-heavyweights Steve McCarthy and Tony Wilson met in 1989, with McCarthy scoring a third-round knockdown\n\nand then looking to finish the fight.\n\nAs the pair exchanged haymakers, an even more dangerous combatant entered the ring: Wilson\u2019s 62-year-old mother in a floral dress, who began whacking McCarthy with her shoe.\n\nMcCarthy celebrated his apparent victory, but strangely, this was not over. Referee Adrian Morgan insisted the fight must continue, and McCarthy refused, citing his head wound from the shoe (which would later require stitches).\n\nWilson was, therefore, declared the winner \u2013 via a massive assist from his mother.\n\n1. The bite fight\n\nIt is the most infamous ending in boxing history.\n\nBites in fights are not unknown, but the planet\u2019s most famous heavyweight \u2013 Mike Tyson \u2013 biting a chunk out of Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear, leaving him jumping around the ring in agony, in their 1997 rematch was something else. Not least because referee Mills Lane (why always him?) actually allowed it to continue.\n\nHowever, when a second nibble on Evander\u2019s other ear was spotted, Tyson was thrown out. At which point, he began violently trying to get across the crowded ring to Holyfield.\n\n\u2018Iron Mike\u2019 was fined $3 million and banned for 15 months, though he and Evander quickly made up and remain firm friends to this day \u2013 perhaps the weirdest outcome of all."

    "body": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nVirtual private networks (VPNs) have been having a moment recently. Massive marketing budgets and influencer collaborations have convinced consumers that a VPN\u2019s functionality and privacy features will solve all of their security woes. However, it\u2019s not as cut-and-dry as that. VPNs are just one part of a robust online security routine, but given the number of VPN services out there today, it can be hard to figure out which one will be right for you. Not to mention that you often have to dig through claims of attributes that aren\u2019t always totally accurate to get to that answer. We tested out nine of the best VPN services available now and landed on five top picks that should suit most people's needs.\n\nWhat is a VPN?\n\nVPNs, or virtual private networks, mask your IP address and the identity of your computer or mobile device on the network and creating an encrypted \"tunnel\" that prevents your internet service provider (ISP) from accessing data about your browsing history. VPNs are not a one-size-fits-all security solution, though.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re just one part of keeping your data private and secure. Roya Ensafi, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told Engadget that VPNs don\u2019t protect against common threats like phishing attacks, nor do they protect your data from being stolen. Much of the data or information is stored with the VPN provider instead of your ISP, which means that using a poorly designed or unprotected network can still undermine your security. But they do come in handy for online privacy when you\u2019re connecting to an untrusted network somewhere public because they tunnel and encrypt your traffic to the next hop.\n\nThat means sweeping claims that seem promising, like military-grade encryption or total digital invisibility, may not be totally accurate. Instead, Yael Grauer, program manager of Consumer Reports\u2019 online security guide, recommends looking for security features like open-source software with reproducible builds, up-to-date support for industry-standard protocols like WireGuard (CR's preferred protocol) or IPsec, and the ability to defend against attack vectors like brute force.\n\nUnderstand your VPN needs\n\nBefore considering a VPN, make sure your online security is up to date in other ways. That means complex passwords, multifactor authentication methods and locking down your data sharing preferences. Even then, you probably don\u2019t need to be using a VPN all the time.\n\n\u201cIf you're just worried about somebody sitting there passively and looking at your data then a VPN is great,\u201d Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University, told Engadget.\n\nIf you use public WiFi networks a lot, like while working at a coffee shop, then VPN usage can help give you private internet access. They\u2019re also helpful for hiding information from other people on your ISP if you don\u2019t want members of your household to know what you\u2019re up to online.\n\nGeoblocking has also become a popular use case as it helps you reach services in other parts of the world. For example, you can access shows that are only available on streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime, in other countries, or play online games with people located all over the globe.\n\nAre VPNs worth it?\n\nWhether or not VPNs are worth it depends how often you could use it for the above use cases. If you travel a lot and rely on public WiFi or hotspots, are looking to browse outside of your home country or want to keep your traffic hidden from your ISP, then investing in a VPN will be useful. But, keep in mind that even the best VPN services often slow down your internet connection speed, so they may not be ideal all the time.\n\nIn today's world, we recommend not relying on a VPN connection as your main cybersecurity tool. VPN use can provide a false sense of security, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Plus, if you choose just any VPN, it may not be as secure as just relying on your ISP. That\u2019s because the VPN could be based in a country with weaker data privacy regulation, obligated to hand information over to law enforcement or linked to weak user data protection policies.\n\nFor VPN users working in professions like activism or journalism that want to really strengthen their internet security, options like the Tor browser may be a worthwhile alternative, according to Crandall. Tor is free, and while it's less user-friendly, it\u2019s built for anonymity and privacy.\n\nHow we tested\n\nTo test the security specs of different VPNs and name our top picks, we relied on pre-existing academic work through Consumer Reports, VPNalyzer and other sources. We referenced privacy policies, transparency reports and security audits made available to the public. We also considered past security incidents like data breaches.\n\nWe looked at price, usage limits, effects on internet speed, possible use cases, ease of use, general functionality and additional \u201cextra\u201d VPN features like multihop. The VPNs were tested across iOS, Android and Mac devices so we could see the state of the mobile apps across various platforms (Windows devices are also supported in most cases). We used the \u201cquick connect\u201d feature on the VPN apps to connect to the \u201cfastest\u201d provider available when testing internet speed, access to IP address data and DNS and WebRTC leaks or when a fault in the encrypted tunnel reveals requests to an ISP.\n\nOtherwise, we conducted a test of geoblocking content by accessing Canada-exclusive Netflix releases, a streaming test by watching a news livestream on YouTube via a Hong Kong-based VPN and a gaming test by playing on servers in the United Kingdom. By performing these tests at the same time, it also allowed us to test claims about simultaneous device use. Here are the VPN services we tested:\n\nRead more: The best password managers for 2023\n\nBest VPN overall: ProtonVPN\n\nProton Proton VPN Best VPN overall Simultaneous connections : 10\n\nNumber of devices : 10\n\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\n\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox\n\nDedicated IP addresses: Yes, for business users only\n\nTrial/Money-back guarantee: None/30-day money-back guarantee $4.99/month at ProtonVPN\n\nThe VPNs we tried out ranked pretty consistently across all of our tests, but ProtonVPN stood out as a strong option because of its overall security and usability. The Proton Technologies suite of services includes mail, calendar, drive and a VPN known for its end-to-end encryption. This makes it a strong contender for overall security, but its VPN specifically came across as a well-rounded independent service.\n\nProtonVPN\u2019s no-logs policy has passed audits, and the company has proven not to comply with law enforcement requests. Because it is based in Switzerland, there are no forced logging obligations, according to the company. Plus, it\u2019s based on an open-source framework, and has an official vulnerability disclosure program along with clear definitions on what it does with personal information.\n\nWhile ProtonVPN offers a free version, it\u2019s limited compared to other options, with access to server networks in just three countries. Its paid version, starting at about $5.39 per month, includes access to VPN server locations in more than 65 countries on 10 devices at a time. For dedicated Proton Technologies users, they can pay closer to $8.63 for a monthly plan to access the entire suite.\n\nProtonVPN passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests with only a very small toll on connection speeds. It also comes with malware-, ad- and tracker-blocking as an additional service, plus it has a kill switch feature on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and the latest version of Android. It\u2019s available on most major operating systems, routers, TV services and more including Firefox, Linux and Android TV. For dedicated Linux users, ProtonVPN added a new Linux-specific app to support its services in August.\n\nRead our full VPN review of ProtonVPN\n\nBest free VPN: Windscribe\n\nWindscribe Windscribe Best free VPN Simultaneous connections : Unlimited\n\nNumber of devices : Unlimited\n\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\n\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox\n\nDedicated IP addresses: No\n\nTrial/Money-back guarantee: None/None $0 at Windscribe\n\nBy signing up for Windscribe's free plan with your email, users can access 10GB per month of data, unlimited connections and access to more than 10 countries. We selected it as the best free VPN because of its high security and wide range of server locations compared to other free VPNs. It has over 500 servers in over 60 countries, according to the company, and can be configured to routers, smart TVs and more on top of the usual operating systems.\n\nWindscribe doesn\u2019t have a recent independent security audit, but it does publish a transparency report showing that it has complied with zero requests for its data, runs a vulnerability disclosure program encouraging researchers to report flaws and offers multiple protocols for users to connect with.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s easy to use. The set up is intuitive and it passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests. The paid version costs $5.75 to $9 each month, depending on the plan you choose, and includes unlimited data, access to all servers and an ad/tracker/malware blocker. Or, for $1 per location per month, users can build a plan tailored to the VPNs they want to access. Windscribe is still expanding its reach, adding Japan to its list of available spots.\n\nBest VPN for streaming services, frequent travel and gaming: ExpressVPN\n\nWe picked the best VPN service for travel, gaming and streaming based on which one had access to the most locations with high speed connections and no lag. ExpressVPN met all those criteria and was one of the fastest VPNs we tried. Now, it even comes with an in-house password manager, ExpressVPN Keys, to manage and autofill logins across sites included with the subscription. That will make it easier to toggle between streaming and gaming accounts while browsing securely.\n\nAn internet speed test measured faster upload and download speed compared to using no VPN, practically unheard of compared to the other VPNs tested. But being this fast is likely a fluke due to the VPN service circumventing traffic shaping by the ISP or another disparity because even top VPNs will in some way slow down speeds. With 2,000 servers in 160 cities, according to the company, it had one of the broadest global reaches. It also passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests, and it does regular security audits. Plus, Network Lock is its kill switch feature, which keeps your data safe even if you lose connection to the VPN. Subscription costs range from $8.32 to $12.95 per month depending on the term of the plan, and include a password manager.\n\nWith ExpressVPN, users can connect to up to five devices at once, which is on the lower side compared to other services. That said, it works on a bunch of devices from smart TVs to game consoles, unlike some other services that lack support beyond the usual suspects like smartphones and laptops.\n\nRead our full VPN review of Express VPN\n\nBest VPN for cross-platform accessibility: CyberGhost\n\nCyberGhost CyberGhost Best VPN for cross-platform accessibility Simultaneous connections : 7\n\nNumber of devices : 7\n\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\n\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox\n\nDedicated IP addresses: Yes, additional purchase required\n\nTrial/Money-back guarantee: 2 free months/45-day money-back guarantee $2.11/month at CyberGhost\n\nBecause several of the best VPN services connect to routers, cross-platform accessibility isn\u2019t always necessary. By connecting a VPN to your home router, you can actually connect to unlimited devices in your household, as long as they all access the internet through that router.\n\nBut if you use VPNs on the go, and across several devices, being able to connect to a wide range of platforms will be indispensable. CyberGhost offers simultaneous connectivity on up to seven devices for $2.11 to $12.99 per month depending on subscription term. It supports several types of gadgets like routers, computers, smart TVs and more. It\u2019s similar to the support that ExpressVPN offers, but CyberGhost provides detailed instructions on how to set up the cross-platform connections, making it a bit more user-friendly for those purposes. Plus, it just expanded its network of servers from 91 to 100 countries, adding Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic to its available locations.\n\nFrom a security perspective, CyberGhost completed an independent security audit by Deloitte earlier this year, runs a vulnerability disclosure program and provides access to a transparency report explaining requests for its data. An updated version of its transparency report went live in August. While it did pass all of our tests, it\u2019s worth noting that we had trouble connecting to servers in the United Kingdom and had to opt to run our gaming test through an Ireland-based server instead.\n\nBest VPN for multiple devices: Surfshark\n\nSurfshark Surfshark Best VPN for multiple devices Simultaneous connections : Unlimited\n\nNumber of devices : Unlimited\n\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\n\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox, Edge\n\nDedicated IP addresses: Yes, additional purchase required\n\nTrial/Money-back guarantee: 1 free month/30-day money-back guarantee $2.49/month at Surfshark\n\nAs we mentioned before, connecting to a router can provide nearly unlimited access to devices in a single household. But Surfshark VPN is one of few VPN services that offer use on an unlimited number of devices without bandwidth restrictions, according to the company. And you get that convenience without a significant increase in price: Surfshark subscriptions cost about $2.49 to $12.95 for a monthly subscription, and the company recently conducted its first independent audit. It added QR-code-enabled login across devices and expanded support for alternative ID profiles since our initial review, a feature that some of its competitors already had.\n\nWe ran into some trouble connecting to Surfshark\u2019s WireGuard protocol, but tested on an IKEv2 protocol instead. The VPN speed was a bit slow and struggled to connect for our geoblock test at first, but ultimately passed. What makes it different from other VPNs with unlimited connection options is that it has access to a larger number of servers and is available on more types of devices.\n\nRead our full VPN review of Surfshark VPN\n\nOther VPN services our experts tested\n\nNordVPN\n\nNordVPN didn\u2019t quite make the cut because it\u2019s overhyped, and underwhelming. As I've written in our full review of NordVPN, the pricing, up to $14.49 for a \u201ccomplete\u201d subscription, seemed high compared to other services, and its free or lower cost plans just didn\u2019t have the same wide variety of features as its competitors.\n\nTunnelBear\n\nDespite the cute graphics and user friendliness, TunnelBear wasn\u2019t a top choice. It failed numerous basic security tests from Consumer Reports, and had limited availability across platforms like Linux. It did, however, get a major security boost in July when it updated to support WireGuard protocol across more of its platforms.\n\nBitdefender VPN\n\nBitdefender doesn\u2019t offer support for devices like routers, which limits its cross-platform accessibility. It also lacked a transparency report or third-party audit to confirm security specs.\n\nAtlas VPN\n\nAtlas ranked lower on our speed tests compared to the other VPNs tested, with a notably slower difference on web browsing and streaming tests. It was a good option otherwise, but could easily cause headaches for those chasing high speed connections. Security-wise, an Atlas VPN vulnerability leaked Linux users\u2019 real IP addresses.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are some things VPNs are used for?\n\nVPNs are traditionally used to protect your internet traffic. If you\u2019re connected to an untrusted network like public WiFi in a cafe, using a VPN hides what you do from the internet service provider. Then, the owner of the WiFi or hackers trying to get into the system can\u2019t see the identity of your computer or your browsing history.\n\nA common non-textbook use case for VPNs has been accessing geographically restricted content. VPNs can mask your location, so even if you\u2019re based in the United States, they can make it appear as if you\u2019re browsing abroad and unblock access. This is especially useful for streaming content that\u2019s often limited to certain countries, like if you want to watch Canadian Netflix from the US.\n\nWhat information does a VPN hide?\n\nA VPN doesn\u2019t hide all of your data. It only hides information like your IP address, location and browser history. A common misconception is that VPNs can make you totally invisible online. But keep in mind that the VPN provider often still has access to all of this information, so it doesn\u2019t grant you total anonymity. You\u2019re also still vulnerable to phishing attacks, hacking and other cyberthreats that you should be mindful of by implementing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.\n\nAre VPNs safe?\n\nGenerally, yes. VPNs are a safe and reliable way to encrypt and protect your internet data. But like most online services, the safety specifics vary from provider to provider. You can use resources like third-party audits, Consumer Reports reviews, transparency reports and privacy policies to understand the specifics of your chosen provider.\n\nWhat about Google\u2019s One VPN?\n\nAs of early 2023, Google One subscriptions include access to the company\u2019s VPN. It works similarly to other VPNs on our list, hiding your online activity from network operators. Google One subscribers can access the VPN in 22 countries on Android, iOS, Windows and Mac devices, and they can share VPN access with up to five people who are on their One plans. We have not fully tested the Google One VPN yet, but we will add it to this list if we feel it is.\n\nUpdate November 10, 2024: This story was updated after publishing to remove mention of PPTP, a protocol that Consumer Reports' Yael Grauer notes \"has serious security flaws.\""

    "body": "Keep Labs built a lockable storage container for medicine, and it doesn\u2019t matter if the meds come in bottles, boxes or dime bags. The Keep is designed to hold them safely and track their use. The company launched in 2019, won \u2014 and lost \u2014 an innovation award at CES 2020, and this week started shipping its first product to consumers.\n\nThe Keep device is lovely. I have a test unit sitting on my bathroom vanity, and it looks more like a smart speaker than a secure box. There\u2019s a clock on the front and a soft matte finish. Click a button in the app, and the lid opens, revealing a space to hold about six bottles of pills. Or, with secure mode disabled, a double tap on the front opens the device without needing a smartphone.\n\nTake a pill or two? The Keep uses a sophisticated scale to detect the bottles that were returned just a little bit lighter, and this is recorded in the app. Didn\u2019t take your meds? The Keep knows and can trigger a smartphone notification on your or a companion\u2019s phone.\n\nTo the founders, Keep is more than just a secure box; it\u2019s a solution to harm reduction and medication management.\n\nI recently spoke with co-founder, president and chairman Philip Wilkins about the company\u2019s journey from a preorder success story to finding an enterprise offering by partnering with Canadian healthcare providers.\n\nFrom cannabis to medicine\n\nWilkins is an earnest entrepreneur. Spend a few minutes with him, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s passionate about solving the problem of safeguarding medicine.\n\nThis was the second time I spoke with him. The first was back In 2019 when his company won an innovation award at CES 2020. This award was later rescinded because the device was marketed as a cannabis storage device. In 2019, going into 2020, the trade group hosting CES had a strict but convoluted stance on cannabis products. Somehow, Keep Labs won an award. Eventually, someone at the CTIA noticed Keep Labs\u2019 marketing and pulled the prize. This set off a firestorm, eventually leading the CTIA to soften its stance on cannabis-adjacent products \u2014 after all, cannabis is legal in Nevada, where CES is held.\n\nThis experience has had a lasting affect on Keep Labs. Look at the website. Cannabis is not mentioned. The Keep is now marketed with the catch-all term \u201cmedicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cCannabis is still there,\u201d he said, noting that the company is still on the same mission of harm reduction. \u201cCannabis was a great way to start a conversation because everyone wants to talk about cannabis, but no one wants to talk about getting high.\u201d\n\nBy simply saying \u201cmedicine,\u201d the company feels like it found a good middle ground with its messaging. As Wilkins told me, Google and Meta heavily restrict the term \u201ccannabis\u201d in advertising, which limits the marketing reach of such devices as Keep. In advance of the launch, Keep Labs had to conduct preorders using a Shopify store because Kickstarter and Indiegogo also didn\u2019t allow products to be marketed with the term cannabis.\n\nPreorder success\n\nKeep was born from a familiar story. Wilkins was using medication to treat a new condition, and his wife was concerned about their three-year-old getting into the drugs. It\u2019s a growing struggle with many households, especially with the rise of cannabis edibles packaged to look like candy.\n\nAt the time, he looked at the market and saw several pill dispensing devices. \u201cThere were a lot of medication dispensing devices, but it was very clinical in nature. And so, like every crazy entrepreneur, [I said] \u2018let me see if I can go solve this problem for myself.'\u201d\n\nThe company saw early success despite not having a shipping product. They capitalized on the attention of getting kicked out of CES and in December 2019, launched a preorder campaign. Over 15,000 people preordered the device, with 5,000 paying in full. At the time, the preorder noted that all sales were final, but the company reversed course and offered everyone a refund when COVID hit, and Keep Labs lost its manufacturer. Philip said that only 5% of the preorders were canceled.\n\nA time out due to COVID\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic changed Keep Labs. The company was heading toward production when the pandemic hit. Nearly overnight, all of their manufacturing contracts were canceled, leaving the preorders and the company up in the air.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do we do now,\u201d Wilkins said, adding that they took a step back and started talking to their preorder customers \u2014 all of them. For the next year, the company spoke to two to three customers weekly about what made them preorder the device. \u201cWhat we found was that a lot of people were buying [the Keep] for medication tracking, and not for the primary use case of locking medication in a box.\u201d\n\nThis critical feedback led to Wilkins stepping down as CEO. He brought on Jeff Wandzura to lead the company.\n\nWandzura is a trained pharmacist who previously sold two digital health companies. Wilkins said he felt Wandzura\u2019s skills were complementary to his skill set, and it was the right thing to do for the company. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made throughout my career as Jeff grounded the company, has driven our enterprise success, and become a close friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, the pandemic brought about a lot of uncertainty, and we lost some good people,\u201d Wandzura told me. \u201cAfter I started speaking to preorder customers to understand why they bought Keep, it was clear that I needed a partner from the pharma/pharmacy world.\n\n\u201cThe world of medication compliance is complex, and we needed the clinical knowledge on the team. I wasn\u2019t comfortable. And two, I\u2019ve always felt a strong fiduciary duty to my investors to make decisions in the company\u2019s best interest, which meant checking my ego at the door.\u201d\n\nWilkins continues to talk to customers. The company has an active beta program with 150 users, and he calls the top 10 users weekly to better understand their usage. He\u2019s discovered people are now using their Keep for other critical items like keys, passports and cash. He believes these additional use cases show users trust the device.\n\nWith Wandzura leading the company and with gobs of customer feedback, Keep Labs started exploring an enterprise offering focused on medication adherence along with harm reduction.\n\nThe company became part of the McKesson Digital Health Network in Canada to provide real-time data about whether patients are taking their medication. Keep Labs also has a partnership with Savvy Cooperative to give away free Keep devices to patients who are living with chronic conditions. These partnerships provide an invaluable feedback loop of front-line patients interacting with their devices.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make it super easy to deploy to individuals who need support,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cAnd we provide de-identified aggregate data to understand how many patients in the population are adhering [to their medications] and how many need intervention so they can understand patient behaviors at home. We charge a nominal subscription fee for that.\u201d\n\nI asked about how the company safeguards personal data and received the following statement that\u2019s worth reprinting in full:\n\n\u201cProtecting user privacy and ensuring data security are paramount for KEEP. We adhere to stringent data protection regulations such as HIPAA in the U.S. and PIPEDA in Canada to safeguard customer information. All data transmitted through KEEP is encrypted both in transit and at rest, utilizing robust encryption algorithms. Our platform employs multi-factor authentication, regular security audits, and penetration testing to protect against unauthorized access. Furthermore, we conduct ongoing staff training and adhere to a strict privacy policy to ensure that all members of our team are vigilant and adhere to the highest standards of data protection and software development including RBAC. This comprehensive, multi-layered approach to security ensures that patient information remains confidential and secure at all times.\u201d\n\nWilkins added that its encryption keys are generated on the fly within their production environment and securely stored. No individual has direct access to the keys. Data is transmitted using TLS 1.3 encryption, while data at rest is secured with AES-256 encryption. User passwords undergo hashing with PBKDF2 utilizing SHA256. The company uses automated tools such as Scan Hawk and Synk to test its security and provide code vulnerability assessments. He notes that their code is subject to peer reviews, and the company uses the Coalition Cybersecurity and Stendard to provide a final layer of external review.\n\nIt\u2019s worth applauding Keep Lab\u2019s security and privacy measures. The above shows a company that\u2019s proud of its efforts and is comfortable making them public.\n\nCooling meds is next for Keep\n\nWith its first product shipping to consumers, Keep Labs is exploring raising capital at the end of 2023 or early 2024. The company has raised $2.18 million from venture capital sources, including StartUp Health\u2019s Transformer Fund, Plug and Play Tech Center, Onbelay Capital and 001 Ventures.\n\nAngels have helped Keep Labs along the way, too. The company\u2019s advisory board includes former IBM Watson head Michael Rhodin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of contracts we\u2019ll be announcing over the next several months, which is super exciting,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cAnd then after that, it\u2019s the launch of our second-gen product, which is the same as the original, except it\u2019s got a cooling device.\u201d\n\nHe explained that nearly 50% of the drugs in the FDA pipeline require cooling: \u201cOzempic is a great example, and people are keeping it in their fridge, next to their butter, and we\u2019ve heard from customers and enterprise partners that [adding cooling] could be a huge win.\u201d\n\nUntil then, the company\u2019s first-generation product is available from Keep Labs\u2019 website. It comes in black and white and costs $299."

    "body": "Gregg Berhalter and the U.S. men's national team continue their preparations for the 2024 Copa America and 2026 FIFA World Cup with friendlies against Germany and Ghana this month.\n\nFirst, the U.S. will take on Germany in Hartford, Connecticut on October 14. The 15th-ranked Germans are under new management, so the USMNT will serve as the debut match for new head coach Julian Nagelsmann, the 36-year-old who has been out of a job since departing Bayern Munich back in March.\n\nMost European countries are busy with Euro 2024 qualifying, but the Germans are hosting the tournament and therefore qualify automatically, opening up their schedule for this friendly match.\n\nThen, on October 17, the U.S. will travel to GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tennessee for a friendly against Ghana. The two nations have a deep history of contentious matchups, including in three consecutive World Cup tournaments in 2006, 2010, and 2014.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Germany squad, tactics as Julian Nagelsmann debuts as manager\n\nUSA roster for October friendlies vs Germany, Ghana\n\nThe USMNT squad for the October friendlies was announced on Thursday, October 5. Gregg Berhalter has called in 23 players, which is one fewer than were brought in for the friendlies against Uzbekistan and Oman last month.\n\nBelow is the official 23-man roster for the upcoming October friendlies against Germany and Ghana.\n\nPSV midfielder Malik Tillman was forced to withdraw from the squad due to injury, with Alex Zendejas of Club America named to the roster in his place.\n\nMORE: Tracking every goal scored by Christian Pulisic at new club AC Milan\n\nPos Name Club Caps Goals GK Ethan Horvath Nott.

He was initially injured while playing for Leeds United back in March, and while he had finally recovered to make his Bournemouth debut in the EFL Cup in late September, he played just 20 minutes off the bench before suffering a setback, sidelined again for the foreseeable future.\n\nGio Reyna has returned from his leg fracture and is called in for the first time under Berhalter since their falling out at the 2022 World Cup. Also included is defender Cameron Carter-Vickers who only just made his debut for Celtic this season thanks to a hamstring injury. On the heels of that return just before the international break, he is called in.\n\nGoalkeepers Zack Steffen and Sean Johnson remain out of action due to injuries. Additionally, Josh Sargent is sidelined with a long-term ankle injury, while Daryl Dike is also out after tearing his Achilles. Also missing is Antonee Robinson, who Gregg Berhalter said is dealing with a sports hernia, and while he played through it last camp and recently for his club, it's affecting him and therefore rest is the best option here.\n\nJohnny Cardoso had to pull out of the September camp due to an ankle injury, but he has returned to action with Brazilian club Internacional, indicating a return to fitness, and has been included on the squad.\n\nWith Adams injured, there has been some noise on social media calling for Heidenheim midfielder Lennard Maloney to be brought into the squad in October, and he was given the call-up here. The 23-year-old was born in Berlin to an American father, appearing for the U.S. at the U-20 level in the past and stating his desire to reach the USMNT senior squad.\n\nMORE: All players in U.S. national team pool currently playing for a European club\n\nGio Reyna to make USMNT return under Gregg Berhalter\n\nThe ability of Berhalter and Reyna to work together moving forward has been a major talking point since the fallout of their saga after the 2022 World Cup.\n\nReyna's lack of playing time at the World Cup was exacerbated by the actions of his parents in the weeks that followed, which sparked a domestic violence investigation of Berhalter before his eventual re-hire as national team head coach.\n\nNow, having recovered from a leg fracture suffered in summer Nations League duty under an interim USMNT head coach, the 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund playmaker returns to the international fold under Berhalter for the first time.\n\nThe USMNT head coach has been forthcoming about the situation, admitting upon his re-hire that the two have a \"lot of work to do\" but insisting time was needed to broach the situation. With Berhalter having since confirmed the two have broken the ice and talked over the phone, they will now look to move forward without any more personal conflict.\n\nAfter the October roster release, Berhalter confirmed that the two spoke \"weeks ago\" on Zoom, with the U.S. head coach appreciative of Reyna's willingness to move forward. He spoke that because Reyna has not yet played for his club this season, their goal will be to \"get him minutes\" so he can build his fitness and return to Dortmund in the best position possible to begin his club campaign.\n\nBerhalter stated that they see Reyna being able to play three different positions: central midfielder, attacking midfielder, and winger, with further clarification being his skill-set fitting a \"between the lines\" style of wide play if he were deployed on the wing, as opposed to one glued to the touchline."

    "body": "Jamaica's first-ever victory on Canadian soil has seen the Reggae Boyz fight back to reach the CONCACAF Nations League semifinal and qualify for Copa America 2024.\n\nA 3-2 win in the second leg at BMO Field in Toronto allowed Jamaica to progress on away goals after a 4-4 aggregate tie across the two legs.\n\nAfter Canada opened the scoring through Alphonso Davies they held a comfortable 3-1 aggregate lead, but that advantage eroded in 15 second-half minutes as Jamaican striker Shamar Nicholson scored a brace, before Fulham attacker Bobby De Cordova-Reid converted the penalty that sealed progression.\n\nCanada will now have to defeat Trinidad and Tobago in a one-off playoff in March to reach the Copa America 2024 tournament to be hosted in the U.S.\n\nMORE: Highlights, recap of Canada's narrow win in the first leg\n\nThe Sporting News followed the Canada vs. Jamaica match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.\n\nCanada vs. Jamaica result (full-time)\n\nScore Aggregate Goal scorers Canada 2 4 Alphonso Davies (25)\n\nIsmael Kone (69) Jamaica 3 4 Shamar Nicholson (63), (66)\n\nBobby De Cordova-Reid (78)\n\nKickoff: 7:30 p.m. local (7:30 p.m ET / 4:30 p.m. PT)\n\nLocation: BMO Field (Toronto, Canada)\n\nReferee: Cesar Ramos (MEX)\n\nStarting lineups:\n\nCanada (4-4-2): Borjan - Laryea, Miller, Cornelius, Johnston (Millar 84') - Davies, Eustaquio (Russell-Rowe 89'), Kone (Kaye 74'), Buchanan (Hoilett 74') - Larin (Osorio 74'), David\n\nJamaica (4-2-3-1): Blake - Leigh (Gray 94'), Pinnock, Lowe, Lembikisa - Johnson, Latibeaudiere (Hector 46') - Bailey (Bernard 90'), Nicholson, De Cordova-Reid - Gray\n\nIt looked like it was going to be a comfortable night for Canada when Davies opened the scoring on 25 minutes after a lung-bursting run. The Bayern star saw his shot saved onto the crossbar before the ball spun in on the goal line.\n\nThis gave Canada a 3-1 aggregate lead and if it wasn't for Jamaican stopper Andre Blake, there could have easily been a couple more goals, making two great saves from Cyle Larin prior to Davies' opener.\n\nHowever, the home side couldn't get the second goal and Jamaica grew in confidence, particularly after half-time.\n\nIn three second-half minutes, the tie was blown apart by two goals from Shamar Nicholson. A Canadian mistake handed the first to him on a plate before Demarai Gray's individual brilliance set up the second for a tap-in.\n\nWith the scoreline 2-1 on the night, the match was destined for extra time and penalties with a 3-3 aggregate.\n\nBut Jamaica could barely contemplate possible glory before Ismael Kone's header made it 2-2 on the night and gave Canada a single-goal aggregate advantage.\n\nIt appeared as if Canada had weathered the storm until first-leg hero Stephen Eustaquio's handball in the box allowed De Cordova-Reid to score the winning penalty with 12 minutes of regulation to play.\n\nJamaica managed to hold on through nine minutes of stoppage time, despite Gray being given a second yellow card for dissent on 84 minutes.\n\nCanada vs Jamaica live updates, highlights, commentary\n\nFulltime: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\n\nJamaica's first-ever win on Canadian soil sees them advance by away goals to the CONCACAF Nations League semi-final and Copa America 2024. Extraordinary.\n\n95 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\n\nCanada doing all the attacking but the Jamaican defence is well-organised. Hoilett blasts a shot well over the bar from outside the box.\n\n90 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\n\nThere will be nine minutes of added-on time. As it stands Jamaica are through on away goals. What a result this could be.\n\n88 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\n\nCanada are dominating with their man advantage. David gets a free header in the six-yard box but it balloons over the bar. That was a decent chance.\n\n84 mins: RED CARD (Demarai Gray) Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\n\nWhat a brain-fade by Jamaica's Gray. He gets two yellow cards in a minute and is dismissed. He booted the ball away for no reason. Clear second yellow card. Can they hold on now?\n\n83 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\n\nWhat an incredible result this would be for Jamaica. Especially when Canada were cruising with a 3-1 aggregate lead until the 62nd minute.\n\n78 mins: GOAL - Canada 2-3 Jamaica (Bobby De Cordova-Reid), 4-4 aggregate\n\nJamaica are going through as it stands on away goals. The Fulham attacker converts from the spot after a handball from Eustaquio and they are back in front on the night.\n\n74 mins: Canada 2-2 Jamaica, 4-3 aggregate\n\nTriple change for Canada. Junior Hoilett, Jonathan Osorio and Mark Kaye come on for Cyle Larin, Ismael Larin and Tajon Buchanan.\n\n69 mins: GOAL - Canada 2-2 (Ismael Kone), 4-3 aggregate\n\nCanada strike back. What an absolute rollercoaster. Davies floats in a deft cross and Kone's redirects it over Blake to send the crowd wild. Canada progressing on aggregate as we stand. It's on Jamaica now.\n\n66 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-2 (Shamar Nicholson), 3-3 aggregate\n\nWOW. Jamaica have hit the front and we are even on aggregate. What a counter-attack. Gray sprung clear down the left and his ball was prodded in by Nicholson. Incredible turnaround. As it stands, extra time is on the table.\n\n62 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-1 Jamaica (Shamar Nicholson), 3-2 aggregate\n\nTHEY ARE BACK! Lowe takes the ball away from the Canadian defender. He feeds Nicholson in the box and the big striker smashes the ball home. We have a game now.\n\n57 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nThe match has settled significantly after an early onslaught from Jamaica. They seem to be deflated by missing the chance to equalise this leg. They need to find something.\n\n52 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nBeen a great start to the half by Jamaica. Constant pressure. Bailey looks dangerous. Canada needs to ride this storm.\n\n48 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nBailey strikes the crossbar. The Aston Villa winger's shot hits the underside of the bar, bounces on the line and is cleared. Jamaica appeal in vain that the ball crossed the line. Ridiculously close to an equaliser.\n\nSecond half: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nWe are underway in the second period. Can Jamaica strike early or will it be a Canadian cruise?\n\nHalftime: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nIt's been relatively smooth sailing for the Canadians with a single goal giving them a two-goal aggregate advantage. It could have been more goals if it wasn't for the heroics of Andre Blake. Jamaica are going to need a miracle in the second half. One goal could make the home side nervous.\n\n45 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nTwo minutes of time added on.\n\n45 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nWow. Oh so close for Jamaica. Gray cuts in from the left. Delivers a delicious ball through the six-yard box but Nicholson can't quite get his head on the ball. Inches away from connection there.\n\n43 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nJamaica need to get to half-time. A second goal from Canada would end this tie. Davies threatens down the left once again but is flagged for offside.\n\n37 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nEustaquiao swings the free kick into the back post and Miller just can't get his head to it. That was nearly a perfect delivery. It feels like a second goal is coming.\n\n35 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nCanada look dangerous on the break. Davies breaks down the left. He drills a low ball through the penalty box but it deflects off a defender's legs and bounces to safety. Jamaica have to be wary or this match will be over shortly.\n\n31 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nGray plays the ball across the six-yard box, Bailey stabs the ball on goal but it's straight into the arms of Borjan. Jamaica's best chance so far.\n\n29 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\n\nNicholson finds himself through on goal for Jamaica after the lofted pass but he can only spoon a shot well wide. In any case, the offside flag is raised once the play is over.\n\n25 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-0 Jamaica (Alphonso Davies), 3-1 aggregate\n\nAnd there it is. Canada take the lead through Alphonso Davies. The Bayern star initially sprays the ball out wide to David, who plays an inch-perfect pass to Davies in the six-yard box. Blake blocked Davies' goal-bound effort but it looped up, hit the crossbar and then spun in, with Larin making sure he didn't touch the ball in case he was offside.\n\n21 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nStill goalless here at BMO Field. Canada look the more dangerous team with Jamaica threatening sporadically.\n\n15 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nAnother save from Blake. This one might be the pick of the bunch. David pokes the ball to Larin in the six-yard box, but his low shot hits the body of Blake, who is in the right position once again. Only looks like a matter of time until Canada open the scoring.\n\n12 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nBuchanan plays a lovely ball over the top to Larin. The Canadian striker is through on goal. He muscles his way through but the shot is saved by Blake. Belatedly, the assistant referee raises his flag for offside on Larin's initial run.\n\n9 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nWhat a save from Andre Blake. Keeps Jamaica in touch in the tie. Buchanan played an enticing ball across the six-yard box, Lowe made a good connection with the slide at the back post but Blake got his body in the way. Impressive block.\n\n7 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nJohnson sends in a deep free kick for Jamaica but it's cleared for a corner. The first of the match. Johnson takes the corner but it's poorly delivered and Canada eventually clear.\n\n4 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nThe home side has started confidently on the ball. It's going to be a tough task for Jamaica. They have never beaten Canada on the road.\n\nKickoff: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\n\nWe are off and running at BMO Field, Toronto. It's a cold, wet, windy night here.\n\nCanada vs Jamaica: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more\n\n10 min until kickoff: We are edging closer to the start of this match. Can Jamaica overturn a one-goal aggregate deficit on the road?\n\n30 min until kickoff: Jamaica have selected their starting lineup, with Demarai Gray starting as striker in place of the injured Antonio. Leon Bailey and Bobby De Cordova-Reid start on the wings.\n\n60 min until kickoff: The first XI has been released for Canada. Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David start for the home side.\n\n90 min until kickoff: Jamaica will be without West Ham striker Michail Antonio, who suffered an ACL injury in the first leg.\n\n2 hours until kickoff: Welcome to tonight's coverage of the CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal between Canada and Jamaica in Toronto.\n\nUnder the lights \ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/PQjPAvTCMD \u2014 Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 21, 2023\n\nWhat time does Canada vs Jamaica kick-off?\n\nThis CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal second leg at BMO Stadium kicks off on Tuesday, November 21 at 7:30 p.m. local time in Toronto.\n\nHere's how that time translates across the North American regions:\n\nKickoff time Eastern Time 7:30 p.m. Central Time 6:30 p.m. Mountain Time 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time 4:30 p.m.\n\nCanada vs Jamaica projected lineups & team news\n\nCanada interim head coach Mauro Biello deployed a 4-4-2 against Jamaica in the first leg on the road, but expect him to bring back their more-utilized three-defender system. That would allow them to rotate Kamal Miller out, who picked up a yellow card in the first leg, keeping him safe for the semifinals.\n\nIn would step Alistair Johnston and Derek Cornelius, with Steven Vitoria retained alongside them.\n\nThe only injury absence for Canada at the moment is striker Lucas Cavallini, who withdrew from the squad prior to the two matches, replaced by Jacen Russell-Rowe.\n\nCanada projected starting lineup (3-5-2): Borjan (GK) \u2014 Cornelius, Vitoria, Johnston \u2014 Laryea, Eustaquio, Kone, Kaye, Davies \u2014 David, Larin.\n\nJamaica saw star striker Michail Antonio go down with a gutting ACL injury in the first leg, and he now begins a lengthy rehab process. West Ham are reportedly furious about how it was handled, angered by both the conditions of the pitch in Jamaica and the fact he played another 10 minutes after sustaining the injury.\n\nAntonio was replaced by Salernitana striker Trivante Stewart, but he struggled and was himself withdrawn in the 81st minute. Demarai Gray could step in, but he himself is struggling for fitness, and while he remains with the team he was not part of the first leg matchday squad. Another option is Colorado Switchbacks forward Romario Williams, who scored 15 goals in 29 USL Championship matches this season.\n\nOther injuries for Jamaica to contend with include Cory Burke and Amari'i Bell, who both miss out on this international window.\n\nJamaica projected starting lineup (4-3-3): Blake (GK) \u2014 Leigh, Bernard, Pinnock, Lembikisa \u2014 Latibeaudiere, D.

    "body": "BELFAST, Maine \u2014 How does it feel to be a climate scientist in 2023?\n\nLet\u2019s set the scene. Hundreds of picnickers are sprawled across a lawn speckled with colorful blankets. Yachts bob in the bay. Guitars blare, children wrestle and dancers twirl across a concert lawn in the golden glow of a dying summer night.\n\nIt\u2019s a picture-perfect August evening for the seaside town of Belfast\u2019s \u201cSummer Nights\u201d concert series.\n\nOff to the side, Peter Kalmus sits alone. His eyes are closed. His toes are tucked beneath his body. He\u2019s catching an occasional side-eye from onlookers.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m meditating, I don\u2019t feel anxious,\u201d Kalmus later says, explaining that he strives for two hours of meditation a day to keep his climate anxiety at bay. Otherwise, \u201cit\u2019s completely overwhelming.\u201d\n\nMany of us avoid thinking too deeply about the worst scenarios of climate change. He is fixated on them.\n\nKalmus, 49, thinks civilization is on the path to break down, the Biden administration is clueless on climate, and that he might get fired from his job at NASA if he is arrested for a third time protesting what he views as downright madness: the continued use of fossil fuels.\n\nKalmus visited the seaside town of Belfast, Maine, in July and August to visit the Possibility Alliance homestead as he looked for inspiration on how to best live with the effects climate change. (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird and lonely,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to talk about this stuff at parties.\u201d\n\nKalmus, whose strident tweets reach some 340,000 followers on X, is at the vanguard of a group of scientists who are increasingly disillusioned and growing convinced that more radical action is needed to wake up political leaders. He has been on a 15-year quest to halt climate change and has already oriented most everything in his life to minimize his own climate footprint and maximize what he can do to push society to change.\n\nNothing has been enough.\n\nAnd so this summer, as extreme heat and rainfall battered many American communities, Kalmus visited Maine searching for something different. He was looking not for climate solutions, but for new ways to withstand climate change\u2019s harms \u2014 and also to make peace with the grief that often feels inescapable for those who reckon with global warming daily.\n\nclimate scientist exercise bicycle environmentalist (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nThat search brought him to an unusual community called the Possibility Alliance, a homestead where a small group of people is trying to figure out how to live in a world headed for a breakdown (as they see it).\n\nIts leaders eschew capitalism, grow much of their own food, and live without electricity. They\u2019ve dedicated their lives to protest, living off the land as simply as possible, and are preparing their community for ecological disaster and to host climate refugees.\n\nWhile on his working vacation in Maine, Kalmus invited NBC News for a short visit to the community to see the crisis through the eyes of Americans taking it as seriously as anyone.\n\nThe Possibility Alliance is an 11-acre homestead that operates without power, running water or a sewer system. The Hughes family, which operates the alliance, pays only one monthly bill for landline phone service. (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nDetoxifying\n\nAbout a decade ago, Kalmus ditched a promising academic career in astrophysics to study the physics of climate change instead.\n\nHe made other changes too. He stopped flying, became a vegetarian and ditched gasoline-powered cars (he drives a Tesla), cutting his personal emissions by about 90%, according to his math.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a political statement, but a detoxification.\n\n\u201cBurning fossil fuels started to feel more and more disgusting,\u201d he said.\n\nEthan Hughes, who operates the Possibility Alliance, rejects globalization and thinks capitalism is a ruinous symptom of \u201cgreed and separation.\u201d He\u2019s trying to build a gift economy in Belfast, in which neighbors share resources and services with no expectation of repayment. \u201cI\u2019m trying to role-model post-petrol,\u201d Hughes said. (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nKalmus, now a married father of two teenagers, is introspective, earnest and narrowly focused on climate change in both his personal and professional life. Tall with an athletic build, a neat beard and a tangle of messy hair that has a skunklike streak of white, he can sometimes come off like an overgrown teenager: He\u2019s the smartest person in the room, brimming with idealism and still indignant \u2014 with a zeal many adults can no longer muster \u2014 about how life\u2019s most annoying systems work (like the U.S. medical system, a symptom of what he calls the \u201ccapitalist death cult\u201d).\n\nThe changes he made weren\u2019t enough. Kalmus wrote a book on climate change and chained himself to a Chase bank in protest of fossil fuel financing. Twice, he\u2019s been arrested during climate protests.\n\nHis social media posts often evoke heartbreak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of losing basically everything,\u201d he wrote recently on X.\n\nIs anyone listening?\n\nclimate scientist natural farming (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nNot his suburban neighbors in North Carolina, who continue to drive emissions-belching SUVs to big-box stores. Perhaps not even some in the science community, like those who kicked him out of the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual fall meeting last year after he unfurled a banner and protested on the major science conference\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nHe has grown increasingly frustrated with President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act as his signature climate bill. Kalmus thinks it does too little to shut out the fossil fuel industry.\n\n(Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates greenhouse gas emissions will drop 32%-42% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of Biden\u2019s own benchmark for progress. The inflation bill is responsible for about a quarter of that projected decrease.)\n\n\u201cHe brags about how he thinks we should consider him a climate champion because he reentered the Paris accord. That Paris Agreement will take us to about 3 degrees Celsius of global heating,\u201d Kalmus said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a civilization at 3 degrees Celsius.\u201d\n\n(A 2022 United Nations report estimated global temperatures would rise between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100 if countries held to their climate commitments. Many countries remain off that pace.)\n\nClimate change is weighing on scientists, but also everyday Americans.\n\nA 2022 poll found almost two-thirds of Americans say they have been affected by extreme weather they believe was at least partially due to climate change.\n\nAbout 27% of Americans say they are \u201cvery worried\u201d about climate change; another 27% just avoid the subject as best they can. One in 10 reported feeling symptoms of anxiety or depression over climate change.\n\nNo place is safe\n\nTo Kalmus, the best answer he\u2019s found has been to channel his frustrations into protest and civil disobedience, finding community and purpose at the Mountain Valley Pipeline protests and on the streets of New York City during its Climate Week. Outside of meditation, speaking his mind at these events has been the best antidote to his climate despair.\n\nWhen he earned his first arrest, by chaining himself to a bank in Los Angeles last year, he finally felt acknowledged.\n\nclimate scientist arrest (Courtesy Brian Emerson/Climate Ad Project)\n\n\u201cIt was a good combination of risk and sort of communicating emotional truth. So I was able to dig really deep, and say exactly how I felt in the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nHis outburst went viral. His employer, NASA, sent him a letter expressing concern over his two arrests, he says.\n\n(\u201cI\u2019m speaking on my own behalf and that has to be super clear,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNot as a NASA climate scientist. That\u2019s really important for retaining my job.\u201d)\n\nHe worries a third arrest could cost him.\n\n\u201cDo I keep doing science? Or do I, you know, keep engaging in risky activism and maybe lose that job?\u201d Kalmus said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kalmus has grown frustrated that more scientists aren\u2019t agitating at protests and willing to face arrest. And his view of our climate predicament has grown increasingly dark.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s worse than I thought it would be in 2023,\u201d Kalmus said, pointing to record-low Antarctic sea ice and record-high sea surface and land temperatures as signs that Earth systems could be shifting more quickly than the scientific community can grasp.\n\nIn recent years, climate change has begun to sting Kalmus\u2019 personal life.\n\nIn summer 2020, he sickened himself hiking in a California heat wave, then watched a wildfire burn a few miles from his California home, spewing smoke that left his voice raspy and his head aching. The searing temperatures killed a dogwood tree in his front yard. His productivity slowed \u2014 he couldn\u2019t focus on science.\n\nKalmus had dreamed of making a life in the Pacific Northwest, which he felt might be buffered from the worst of climate change. That same year, a heat wave \u2014 considered nearly impossible if not for the influence of climate change \u2014 seared the region for three days, killing hundreds of people, buckling roadways and sending overheated baby birds jumping from their nests and to their deaths.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that no place was safe,\u201d Kalmus said. His family relocated to North Carolina, for his wife Sharon\u2019s work, but the experience planted a seed:\n\nIf he couldn\u2019t stop climate change and he couldn\u2019t avoid it, could he at least find a better way to survive it?\n\nLife at the homestead\n\nKalmus knew what would not work.\n\n\u201cI very quickly eliminated the idea of being a prepper \u2014 you know, hoarding beans and ammunition,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he found himself daydreaming of a simpler life, where he could keep bees, grow vegetables and press cider to drink on a Friday night and live closer to the land.\n\nVisiting the Possibility Alliance, a sprawling 11-acre homestead filled with fruit trees, goats, chickens and a garden, allowed him to scratch an itch he\u2019d entertained for much of his adult life.\n\nThe Hughes family, which operates the homestead, and its guests live largely without electricity or modern technology.\n\nThe family of four doesn\u2019t fly because of climate concerns and also doesn't own a car. Their main use of fossil fuels is to take passenger trains to climate protests.\n\nThey try to eschew capitalism and have built, instead, a \"gift economy\" where resources are shared and skills are traded among neighbors in this tiny corner of Maine. They grow much of their own food, hold trainings for climate protesters and plan to host refugees as climate disasters worsen.\n\nNights are illuminated by candlelight. Neighbors drop by without notice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created what existed 100 years ago,\u201d Ethan Hughes said.\n\nOn a steamy August morning, Kalmus found himself huddled around a faded picnic table at the center of the homestead in Belfast, Maine, sipping his coffee with a rare breed \u2014 people as alarmed by climate change as him.\n\nclimate scientist environmental (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nEthan, the charismatic, folksy co-founder of the Possibility Alliance, started the day off with a poem about a deer in the forest and then began to outline daily chores \u2014 chopping wood, building a new deck, caring for goats.\n\nSoon, talk turned to climate change and Kalmus\u2019 grief began to flow as he shared findings from unpublished research on his projections of heat in moderate emissions scenarios through the year 2300.\n\n\u201cEven in the coolest time of day, people will be dying if they don\u2019t have air conditioning,\u201d Kalmus told the group.\n\n\u201cEverything is already spinning out of control,\u201d said Sarah Wilcox-Hughes, dismayed.\n\nKalmus opened up to the table. He\u2019d been procrastinating for months on finishing the research and he was running into his \u201cpsychological limitations.\u201d He felt he was letting the planet down.\n\n\u201cAnyone want to rub Peter\u2019s shoulders as he writes?\u201d Ethan said.\n\nLater, Kalmus relayed a recent, gloomy conversation with a fellow scientist.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is probably past its tipping point,\u201d Kalmus said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe that it happened during my lifetime.\u201d\n\nPeter Kalmus sits with his son Zane on a porch swing at the Possibility Alliance. (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nCrickets trilled. Roosters crowed. A tear dripped down Ethan\u2019s cheek.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s dedicate our work today to the Amazon,\u201d Ethan said, outlining for the group how the work planned would sequester carbon and show people they could live without fossil fuels and that they could take meaningful action against climate change, even as world governments failed them.\n\n(Estimates of when the Amazon could \u201ctip\u201d and transition to savannah vary. Timothy Lenton, a University of Exeter professor who studies climate tipping points and the Amazon\u2019s resilience, said most estimates suggest the Amazon could cross a threshold as soon as 2 degrees C of warming.)\n\nLife at the Possibility Alliance carried on. Will Foley, who hitchhiked from Florida to stay at the homestead, swung a scythe to clear brush. Frankie Williams and Max Kurke, recent college graduates living at the alliance as summer apprentices, piled wood while wearing oversize sun hats. Ethan corralled goats for \u201cmob grazing,\u201d a process he says helps sequester carbon.\n\nKalmus, trailed by a reporter, buzzed around the homestead like a giddy kid, hiking back and forth to a home in an eco-village near the Possibility Alliance where he was living and working on his research. He tramped down a forest trail in bare feet, paused work for a midday dip in a shady stream and never changed his T-shirt.\n\nHe ground his coffee with a mortar and pestle, thumbed through a book of Enneagram personality types on the porch with his son Zane and listened to Ethan\u2019s stories about sailing across the Atlantic in a cargo ship to avoid the carbon emissions of flying.\n\n\u201cI feel met by Peter,\u201d Sarah Wilcox-Hughes said of Kalmus. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like there are many people prioritizing the needs of the planet as he is and we are.\u201d\n\nKalmus found life in Belfast, and at the Possibility Alliance, slower, richer and more connected to the natural world.\n\nDuring his time in Belfast, Kalmus strummed a mandolin in a Celtic folk music group that meets at the eco-village, along with his son Zane, Wilcox-Hughes and her daughter, Etta. He picked berries and ate fresh goat cheese and helped Ethan load hay into a neighbor\u2019s barn.\n\nclimate scientist music group (Evan Bush / NBC News)\n\nHe spoke at the local library about climate change. He shared art, food and labor with neighbors. He saw how a community was sprouting up around the Possibility Alliance \u2014 people willing to sacrifice the conveniences of a modern life built on fossil fuels.\n\nHe felt safer here and more energized to work.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the place, but the people, he realized.\n\nPeople at the center\n\nMaine, like anywhere else, isn\u2019t immune to climate change. But here, at least, he had people who understood his angst, who could share music and joy, who were willing to make their own sacrifices, and who were trying to prepare their community in the way they thought was best.\n\nMonths later, after returning \u201ckicking and screaming\u201d to the \u201cquote-unquote real world,\u201d Kalmus was planning a return trip to the Possibility Alliance over the winter holidays.\n\nHe was still mulling why the Possibility Alliance\u2019s \u201clow energy\u201d lifestyle had felt so meaningful and what was missing from modern life.\n\nEthan Hughes his goats out to\n\n\u201cEverything is too fast,\u201d Kalmus said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to a lot of people, but it\u2019s a new revelation to me. There\u2019s nothing more important in life than relationships.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

    "body": "Climate change isn't going away, and it isn't going to get any better \u2014 at least if we keep legislating as we have been. In Democracy in a Hotter Time: Climate Change and Democratic Transformation, a multidisciplinary collection of subject matter experts discuss the increasingly intertwined fates of American ecology and democracy, arguing that only by strengthening our existing institutions will we be able to weather the oncoming \"long emergency.\"\n\nIn the excerpt below, contributing author and Assistant Professor of Environment and Sustainability at the University at Buffalo, Holly Jean Buck, explores how accelerating climate change, the modern internet and authoritarianism's recent renaissance are influencing and amplifying one another's negative impacts, to the detriment of us all.\n\nMIT Press\n\nExcerpted from Democracy in a Hotter Time: Climate Change and Democratic Transformation, edited by David W. Orr. Published by MIT Press. Copyright \u00a9 2023. All rights reserved.\n\nBurning hills and glowing red skies, stone-dry riverbeds, expanses of brown water engulfing tiny human rooftops. This is the setting for the twenty-first century. What is the plot? For many of us working on climate and energy, the story of this century is about making the energy transition happen. This is when we completely transform both energy and land use in order to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change \u2014 or fail to.\n\nConfronting authoritarianism is even more urgent. About four billion people, or 54 percent of the world, in ninety-five countries, live under tyranny in fully authoritarian or competitive authoritarian regimes. The twenty-first century is also about the struggle against new and rising forms of authoritarianism. In this narration, the twenty-first century began with a wave of crushed democratic uprisings and continued with the election of authoritarian leaders around the world who began to dismantle democratic institutions. Any illusion of the success of globalization, or of the twenty-first century representing a break from the brutal twentieth century, was stripped away with Russia\u2019s most recent invasion of Ukraine. The plot is less clear, given the failure of democracy-building efforts in the twentieth century. There is a faintly discernable storyline of general resistance and rebuilding imperfect democracies.\n\nThere\u2019s also a third story about this century: the penetration of the Internet into every sphere of daily, social, and political life. Despite turn-of-the-century talk about the Information Age, we are only beginning to conceptualize what this means. Right now, the current plot is about the centralization of discourse on a few corporate platforms. The rise of the platforms brings potential to network democratic uprisings, as well as buoy authoritarian leaders through post-truth memes and algorithms optimized to dish out anger and hatred. This is a more challenging story to narrate, because the setting is everywhere. The story unfolds in our bedrooms while we should be sleeping or waking up, filling the most quotidian moments of waiting in line in the grocery store or while in transit. The characters are us, even more intimately than with climate change. It makes it hard to see the shape and meaning of this story. And while we are increasingly aware of the influence that shifting our media and social lives onto big tech platforms has on our democracy, less attention is devoted to the influence this has on our ability to respond to climate change.\n\nThink about these three forces meeting \u2014 climate change, authoritarianism, the Internet. What comes to mind? If you recombine the familiar characters from these stories, perhaps it looks like climate activists using the capabilities of the Internet to further both networked protest and energy democracy. In particular, advocacy for a version of \u201cenergy democracy\u201d that looks like wind, water, and solar; decentralized systems; and local community control of energy.\n\nIn this essay, I would like to suggest that this is not actually where the three forces of rising authoritarianism x climate change x tech platforms domination leads. Rather, the political economy of online media has boxed us into a social landscape wherein both the political consensus and the infrastructure we need for the energy transition is impossible to build. The current configuration of the Internet is a key obstacle to climate action.\n\nThe possibilities of climate action exist within a media ecosystem that has monetized our attention and that profits from our hate and division. Algorithms that reap advertising profits from maximizing time-on-site have figured out that what keeps us clicking is anger. Even worse, the system is addictive, with notifications delivering hits of dopamine in a part of what historian and addiction expert David Courtwright calls \u201climbic capitalism.\u201d Society has more or less sleepwalked into this outrage-industrial complex without having a real analytic framework for understanding it. The tech platforms and some research groups or think tanks offer up \u201cmisinformation\u201d or \u201cdisinformation\u201d as the framework, which present the problem as if the problem is bad content poisoning the well, rather than the structure itself being rotten. As Evgeny Morozov has quipped, \u201cPost-truth is to digital capitalism what pollution is to fossil capitalism \u2014 a by-product of operations.\u201d\n\nA number of works outline the contours and dynamics of the current media ecology and what it does \u2014 Siva Vaidhyanathan\u2019s Antisocial Media, Safiya U. Noble\u2019s Algorithms of Oppression, Geert Lovink\u2019s Sad by Design, Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s Surveillance Capitalism, Richard Seymour\u2019s The Twittering Machine, Tim Hwang\u2019s Subprime Attention Crisis, Tressie McMillan Cottom\u2019s writing on how to understand the social relations of Internet technologies through racial capitalism, and many more. At the same time, there\u2019s reasonable counter-discussion about how many of our problems can really be laid at the feet of social media. The research on the impacts of social media on political dysfunction, mental health, and society writ large does not paint a neat portrait. Scholars have argued that putting too much emphasis on the platforms can be too simplistic and reeks of technological determinism; they have also pointed out that cultures like the United States\u2019 and the legacy media have a long history with post-truth. That said, there are certainly dynamics going on that we did not anticipate, and we don\u2019t seem quite sure what to do with them, even with multiple areas of scholarship in communication, disinformation, and social media and democracy working on these inquiries for years.\n\nWhat seems clear is that the Internet is not the connectedness we imagined. The ecology and spirituality of the 1960s, which shaped and structured much of what we see as energy democracy and the good future today, told us we were all connected. Globally networked \u2014 it sounds familiar, like a fevered dream from the 1980s or 1990s, a dream that in turn had its roots in the 1960s and before. Media theorist Geert Lovink reflects on a 1996 interview with John Perry Barlow, Electronic Frontier Foundation cofounder and Grateful Dead lyricist, in which Barlow was describing how cyberspace was connecting each and every synapse of all citizens on the planet. As Lovink writes, \u201cApart from the so-called last billion we\u2019re there now. This is what we can all agree on. The corona crisis is the first Event in World History where the internet doesn\u2019t merely play \u2018a role\u2019 \u2014 the Event coincides with the Net. There\u2019s a deep irony to this. The virus and the network ... sigh, that\u2019s an old trope, right?\u201d Indeed, read through one cultural history, it seems obvious that we would reach this point of being globally networked, and that the Internet would not just \u201cplay a role\u201d in global events like COVID-19 or climate change, but shape them.\n\nWhat if the Internet actually has connected us, more deeply than we normally give it credit for? What if the we\u2019re-all-connected-ness imagined in the latter half of the twentieth century is in fact showing up, but manifesting late, and not at all like we thought? We really are connected \u2014 but our global body is neither a psychedelic collective consciousness nor a infrastructure for data transmission comprising information packets and code. It seems that we\u2019ve made a collective brain that doesn\u2019t act much like a computer at all. It runs on data, code, binary digits \u2014 but it acts emotionally, irrationally, in a fight-or-flight way, and without consciousness. It\u2019s an entity that operates as an emotional toddler, rather than with the neat computational sensing capacity that stock graphics of \u201cthe Internet\u201d convey. Thinking of it as data or information is the same as thinking that a network of cells is a person.\n\nThe thing we\u2019re jacked into and collectively creating seems more like a global endocrine system than anything we might have visualized in the years while \u201ccyber\u201d was a prefix. This may seem a banal observation, given that Marshall McLuhan was talking about the global nervous system more than fifty years ago. We had enthusiasm about cybernetics and global connectivity over the decades and, more recently, a revitalization of theory about networks and kinship and rhizomes and all the rest. (The irony is that with fifty years of talk on \u201csystems thinking,\u201d we still have responses to things like COVID-19 or climate that are almost antithetical to considering interconnected systems \u2014 dominated by one set of expertise and failing to incorporate the social sciences and humanities). So \u2014 globally connected, yet divided into silos, camps, echo-chambers, and so on. Social media platforms are acting as agents, structuring our interactions and our spaces for dialogue and solution-building. Authoritarians know this, and this is why they have troll farms that can manipulate the range of solutions and the sentiments about them.\n\nThe Internet as we experience it represents a central obstacle to climate action, through several mechanisms. Promotion of false information about climate change is only one of them. There\u2019s general political polarization, which inhibits the coalitions we need to build to realize clean energy, as well as creates paralyzing infighting within the climate movement about strategies, which the platforms benefit from. There\u2019s networked opposition to the infrastructure we need for the energy transition. There\u2019s the constant distraction from the climate crisis, in the form of the churning scandals of the day, in an attention economy where all topics compete for mental energy. And there\u2019s the drain of time and attention spent on these platforms rather than in real-world actions.\n\nAny of these areas are worth spending time on, but this essay focuses on how the contemporary media ecology interferes with climate strategy and infrastructure in particular. To understand the dynamic, we need to take a closer look at the concept of energy democracy, as generally understood by the climate movement, and its tenets: renewable, small-scale systems, and community control. The bitter irony of the current moment is that it\u2019s not just rising authoritarianism that is blocking us from good futures. It\u2019s also our narrow and warped conceptions of democracy that are trapping us.\n\nThis article contains affilate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission."

    "body": "Your time \u2014 and money \u2014 is precious. Polygon\u2019s What to Buy has rounded up the best in gaming hardware, entertainment, tabletop, merch, and toys, and how to get them for the best value, so you spend less time shopping and more time enjoying.\n\nFinding the best controller for playing PC games is a more personal journey than it sounds. It\u2019s got to be comfortable to use, with every button, stick, and trigger easily in reach. It\u2019s also important that you\u2019re getting the features you want. For example, those might include easy setup on PC, good battery life, multi-platform compatibility, and accessibility options, like the ability to remap buttons and adjust stick or trigger sensitivity.\n\nAt Polygon, we play games on a lot of consoles and platforms \u2014 both new and old. Our staff has a wide variety of preferences and needs. We\u2019ve come together to share our favorite PC-ready controllers.\n\nMicrosoft Xbox controller\n\nOn the Polygon team, the Xbox controller got the highest number of endorsements of any controller. This speaks to its comfort and value, and that Microsoft has released enough colors to satisfy varying tastes in design. It also helps that it\u2019s usually around $50 (depending on the color), and that it just works with most PC games. Regardless of the Windows PC game client, there are no extra steps for setting it up.\n\nThis controller is a refined version of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One wireless model, with added texture around its grips, plus a capture button in the middle. It can, of course, connect to Xbox consoles, and to PCs that have Bluetooth. One universally positive change from the older version is that, if you want to connect via a cable for wired play, its connector port is the more ubiquitous USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening, though it can only be used if your controller is wired into your PC, not wirelessly.\n\n\u201cThe Xbox wireless controller just works for me \u2014 it fits right in my hands, the texture feels just right, and it\u2019s not too heavy\u201d \u2014Nicole Carpenter\n\nBeyond PC compatibility, the Xbox controller boasts native compatibility on Steam Deck, plus recent versions of Android and iOS. So, whether you have a phone or tablet, this controller can easily connect via Bluetooth. A growing number of mobile games support it, too, and it works like a charm with the Xbox Game Pass game streaming app.\n\nIt can work on even more platforms if you purchase 8BitDo\u2019s clever $19.99 USB Adapter 2. With it, you can use the Xbox controller on your Nintendo Switch. In addition to Switch support, this USB adapter lets you easily connect your Xbox controller to other devices, like Mac, Raspberry Pi, and more.\n\nThe biggest downside to the Xbox controller might not bother you: It requires two AA batteries, though on a positive note, the battery life is around the 40-hour range, depending on usage. If you don\u2019t want to change out batteries, we recommend this $44.99 8BitDo dual controller charging dock, which includes two rechargeable battery packs, enough for two controllers.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox Elite Series 2 builds on the excellent foundation of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox controller with features that enthusiast gamers may appreciate. It features swappable stick caps and directional pads, adjustable tension for its analog sticks, and customizable back paddles. It also ships in a nice zip-up case. If you want more buttons and tweakable settings in a controller, this might be worth its $178.99 price. This model is compatible with Xbox and PC.\n\nIf you don\u2019t need all of the extra accessories that come with the Elite Series 2, Microsoft makes a cheaper Elite Series 2 Core. If you decide later on that you want the paddles, zip-up case, and swappable sticks, you can buy this third-party kit on Amazon for $22.99.\n\nSony DualSense controller\n\nThere\u2019s another slice of our staff who swear by Sony\u2019s DualSense, a modern controller that retains the symmetrical analog stick arrangement that PlayStation controllers are known for. Compared directly to the Xbox controller, the DualSense has similar levels of compatibility (both are compatible with Android and iOS, and feature built-in Bluetooth for support on PC). However, the DualSense does have key differences, as well as a few perks that help to justify its higher $69.99 price.\n\nIn terms of using the DualSense on a PC, it\u2019s possible to do, but it\u2019s a little complicated. It can connect via Bluetooth for a wireless connection, but games that don\u2019t support the DirectInput controller API likely won\u2019t recognize it as a controller. Plugging the controller into your PC might solve that issue, but there are other ways to get around this barrier if playing wirelessly is important to you.\n\nOne is to rely on Steam, which supports the DualSense controller with its SteamInput API. That makes Sony\u2019s controller a first-class citizen in the eyes of Steam, right next to the Xbox controller, and plenty of games should offer no-fuss DualSense support.\n\nIf you have PC games that you want to play on other services, like PC Game Pass, Epic Games Store, and more, you might experience some middling compatibility with the DualSense. However, adding them as a \u201cnon-Steam game\u201d within Steam can solve for this. To do this, click the \u201cAdd a Game\u201d option in the bottom left corner of the Steam client, then find the executable file (.exe) in your storage.\n\n\u201cI like the PS5 DualSense because it\u2019s incredibly precise \u2014 using it, after coming from previous gen controllers, felt like putting on glasses and seeing the world come into focus\u201d \u2014Nicole Clark\n\nTo get around using Steam entirely, you can download an app called DS4Windows along with some drivers, which ensures game compatibility on PC by emulating the DualSense as an Xbox controller. The app gives you a host of settings to customize the DualSense\u2019s button mapping, if you wish. And, in case you want to go down the rabbit hole of figuring out which PC games support the DualSense\u2019s haptics and adaptive trigger features (and the steps to getting them to work), the site PCGamingWiki has you covered.\n\nRelated Here are the best PS5 accessories\n\nThe DualSense is the official controller for the PS5. In games that support its features, it can have realistic-feeling haptic feedback and gyroscopic motion controls, and its triggers can provide tension to make certain actions feel more realistic. There\u2019s no better controller for the PS5 than this one. It\u2019s a good controller for using PS Remote Play, too. When it\u2019s connected to an Android device for a PS Remote Play session, the DualSense supports adaptive triggers in games that take advantage of the feature.\n\n8BitDo\u2019s $19.99 USB Adapter 2 also works perfectly with the DualSense, letting you play games on your Switch with it once it\u2019s paired. I preferred to play Splatoon 3 with my PS5 controller\u2019s analog stick arrangement. Heck, it even supports gyroscopic camera movement, just like the official Switch controllers.\n\nJust like Microsoft, Sony also has its own pro-grade controller. It\u2019s the $199.99 DualSense Edge, which is compatible with the PS5. It\u2019s tempting to call out its similarities to the Xbox Elite Series 2, of which there are plenty, but it\u2019s more helpful to speak about how it differs. For one, its stick modules can be replaced entirely \u2014 a move that makes the DualSense Edge a little more user-repairable. Also, the PS5\u2019s interface for the Edge is intuitive, and it makes remapping controls and setting schemes the breeze that it should be.\n\nWhile the Edge is compatible on PC, Sony and Steam haven\u2019t developed drivers that let gamers take full advantage of its back paddles and swappable control schemes.\n\nNintendo Switch Pro controller\n\nThe Switch Pro controller is another staff favorite. If it\u2019s a great Nintendo Switch and PC controller you\u2019re after, this is the pinnacle in terms of comfort, durability, battery life, and other Switch-specific extras, but we\u2019ll get to those a little later.\n\nThe Switch Pro controller can be used to play PC games. But like the DualSense, it\u2019s not a plug-and-play affair unless you literally plug it in via USB. To use it wirelessly, running Steam can help you out, as it officially supports the Switch Pro controller. Adding non-Steam games to your Steam library is a clever way to ensure compatibility for games that support controllers. Again, you can do that by clicking the \u201cAdd a Game\u201d option on the bottom left corner in the Steam client.\n\n\u201cThis is a very solid, unassuming but beautifully engineered pad, with Nintendo\u2019s typically great ergonomics and switchgear. The D-pad is one of the best out there, and those lovely, fat, responsive face buttons will give you SNES flashbacks in a good way\u201d \u2014Oli Welsh\n\nAlternatively, if you don\u2019t want to use Steam to play your games, relying on DS4Windows and its bevy of drivers is a free yet slightly advanced way to make Windows recognize your Switch Pro wireless controller. Of course, that $19.99 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 that I keep referencing can come in handy here, too. After plugging it into your PC and tethering wirelessly to it, you\u2019re good to go \u2014 no fussing with apps required.\n\nThe Switch Pro controller is, unsurprisingly, a fantastic Switch controller. Like the Joy-Cons, it supports motion controls, HD rumble for more subtle, accurate jolts of haptic feedback in games, and amiibo connectivity to redeem in-game perks in several games, including the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nThis might seem small, but it stands out as being one of a few wireless Switch controllers in existence that can wake the console remotely by holding down its home button. Many require you to manually turn on the console, which can be a minor annoyance.\n\n8BitDo Ultimate 2.4g controller\n\n8BitDo has released a lot of controllers in recent years, but the name for its Ultimate controller is fitting. It has many of the features from its best gamepads, plus some extras that should settle any sticker shock associated with its $49.99 price.\n\nFor starters, its asymmetrical analog stick layout, overall shape, and face button labels should feel right at home for people who love the shape of the Xbox controller. All of the buttons, triggers, and sticks feel just as good to use as any modern controller from a console manufacturer.\n\nLike several other 8BitDo controllers, this one can be thoroughly customized with its Ultimate software on mobile devices, or on PC. From there, you can remap controls, assign buttons to its two rear paddle buttons, tweak the actuation sensitivity of its triggers, and adjust stick settings. The controller allows up to three custom control schemes, which you can switch between with its middle \u201cstar\u201d button.\n\nThe Ultimate controller ships with a charging dock, and nesting inside of that dock is a 2.4 GHz transmitter that makes it fast and easy to connect to a PC. The dock makes for a convenient way to charge the controller, and you can switch between DirectInput and XInput by using a switch on its back, depending on the requirements of each PC game.\n\n8BitDo makes a pricier version of this controller with Nintendo-style face buttons called the Ultimate Bluetooth. They\u2019re virtually identical, and it can work via 2.4 GHz with PC, too. However, its biggest benefit is its Gulikit Hall effect analog sticks, which are resistant to developing drift over time by design. By comparison, the potentiometer-based sticks used in the Ultimate 2.4g (and all of the other controllers mentioned so far) bear no such guarantee. There\u2019s a possibility you may never experience the issue firsthand, but the anti-drifting sticks alone might be a reason for some to consider buying the Ultimate Bluetooth.\n\nThe Ultimate Bluetooth is similar in a lot of ways to Nintendo\u2019s Switch Pro controller, with its motion control support, rechargeable battery, and Nintendo-style face button layout. However, it doesn\u2019t have all of the same features. For instance, it doesn\u2019t support NFC, so you can\u2019t tap an amiibo on it, and its haptics aren\u2019t up to par with Nintendo\u2019s. However, it\u2019s one of a few third-party Switch controllers that can wake your console from sleep. If it\u2019s paired, press the home button, then shake the controller to awaken the Switch.\n\nUpdate (Nov. 17): Checked prices and links for accuracy."

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified Monday in the U.S. government\u2019s antitrust trial against the company. The executive defended Google\u2019s business tactics, including its deal with Apple and other partners to make Google the default search engine.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a 2020 antitrust claim over Google\u2019s dominance in the online search market. The claim is separate from one filed in January by the Department of Justice, along with eight states including New York, California and Colorado, that aims to \u201chalt Google\u2019s anticompetitive scheme, unwind Google\u2019s monopolistic grip on the market and restore competition to digital advertising.\u201d\n\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products.\n\nGoogle argues that it\u2019s just doing business. Everybody wants Google as the default engine because it\u2019s the best. That doesn\u2019t make its actions illegal, the company says.\n\nMonday\u2019s trial hearing revealed plenty of juicy tidbits, including the $26.3 billion Google spent making itself the default search engine across platforms in 2021, how Google tried to take it further and have Chrome preinstalled on iPhones and more.\n\nGoogle paid $26 billion in 2021 to be everyone\u2019s default search engine\n\nWhen Google\u2019s search head Prabhakar Raghavan testified in court on October 28, he revealed that the tech giant had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to multiple browsers, phones and platforms, from companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, The Verge reports.\n\nAbout $18 billion of that total amount went directly to Apple, according to a New York Times report published earlier this month. Google has had its deal with Apple in place since 2003.\n\nWhen questioned on the amount of money Google spends to get first pick of search engines, Pichai said that the decision was made with the consumer in mind. Google pays big bucks to be everywhere so that it can take in all the data and be the best search engine across different companies\u2019 devices, said Pichai, according to The Verge.\n\nGoogle understood the value of defaults very early on. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Meagan Bellshaw showed Pichai a 2007 email from a Google product strategy meeting containing data showing that when people changed their browser homepage to Google, they did 15% more Google searches. When they switched away, their Google searches dropped 27%.\n\n\u201cNitin argues that focusing on homepage market share is one of the most effective things we can do to make gains in search market share,\u201d read an email that summarized the meeting and was sent to Pichai, as well as other Google leaders, according to The Verge.\n\nThe amount that Google spent on homepage market share has been a fixing point in the trial. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Microsoft and DuckDuckGo testified that their search engines would have been far more successful, even competitive with Google, had they been able to make similar deals with Apple. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even said he was willing to spend $15 billion per year to get Bing into Apple\u2019s default search, per The Information.\n\nGoogle agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users\n\nAs part of its search deal with Apple, Google agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users, reports Bloomberg. Google would have been able to do this with banners, pop-ups and other annoying means in other Google apps.\n\nThe agreement also meant that Apple never switched to a Google competitor or allowed users to choose their browser when setting up their iPhones.\n\nGoogle tried to be preinstalled on iPhones\n\nPichai admitted to attempting to get Tim Cook to preinstall Google on every iOS device back in 2018, according to The Verge. He hoped to make Google and Apple\u2019s services so connected as to be inseparable.\n\nThe way Pichai pitched it would have been a win-win for both companies. Google gets more people searching on its platform \u2014 not to mention all that juicy data \u2014 and Apple would get more revenue, as a result of the lucrative search agreement the two signed.\n\nFor whatever reason, Cook didn\u2019t take the bait. Apple doesn\u2019t preload third-party software onto its devices, and it wasn\u2019t going to make an exception for Google.\n\nGoogle\u2019s deleted chat logs\n\nDuring Pichai\u2019s testimony, the DOJ touched on Google\u2019s policy of deleting internal chat messages, despite being subject to a litigation hold. In February, the DOJ accused Google of systematically destroying chats through its history-off option, which deletes messages every 24 hours unless a user manually changed the setting.\n\nPichai said that he took action against the history-off default for chat in February to comply with the DOJ\u2019s litigation hold, according to CNBC.\n\nBellshaw pulled up a message exchange in 2021 where Pichai asked for history to be turned off in a group chat. Pichai responded that he wanted to discuss a personnel matter and the subject had nothing to do with the litigation hold, which he said he takes great care to comply with.\n\nA moment of nostalgia for Internet Explorer\n\nCast your memories back to 2005, when Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer became the default search engine. Back then, Google\u2019s legal chief David Drummond sent Microsoft an angry letter, saying that making Internet Explorer the search default was anticompetitive. Oh, how the tables have turned.\n\nAfter establishing that Google understands the inherent value of defaults, Bellshaw brought up Drummond\u2019s letter to establish the hypocrisy of Google today. The letter declared that problems with a default setting are made worse by how changes to defaults are handled, and that most end users \u201cdo not change defaults.\u201d\n\nThese are exactly the arguments that other search engine companies, like DuckDuckGo, Brave or Microsoft\u2019s Bing, make when they accuse Google of being anticompetitive by making deals with Apple and others. The DOJ doubled down on this, saying Google has become the monopoly it denounced years ago.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe case is expected to continue for several weeks, bringing to a head one of the biggest fights in tech antitrust since the U.S. took Microsoft to trial in the 1990s.\n\nIf the judge rules against Google, the outcome could look a lot like the Microsoft deal, in which the computer company was required to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. Microsoft was also banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with computer manufacturers.\n\nGoogle might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users. The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday.\n\nThe Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases. The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company\u2019s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. There\u2019s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nEnforcers will want to show that antitrust law is still relevant and can successfully take on the biggest, most powerful companies in the world."

    "body": "Countries have teamed up through a United Nations program to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Can it be done?\n\nAn HIV diagnosis hasn't been a death sentence for years, thanks to powerful medications.\n\nDespite incredible progress, however, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) remains a global public health threat, with 1.3 million new infections and around half that many deaths in 2022 alone.\n\nWhile new HIV infections have dropped steadily since their peak in 1995 , as people live longer with the disease, the pool of people who are HIV-positive has only grown. People with HIV must consistently take medications to prevent the virus from becoming transmissible again or progressing to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). As a result, new infections could actually rebound fast if the world doesn't dramatically ramp up the number of people being regularly treated, tested and protected from new HIV infections.\n\nBut we could head off that rebound risk by the end of the decade, experts say.\n\nCountries around the world have signed onto an ambitious United Nations program with a goal to \"reduce the rate of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths to below the reproductive rate of 1,\" country by country, Quarraisha Abdool Karim , associate scientific director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa and a joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) special ambassador, told Live Science. That would mean each person living with HIV would infect fewer than one additional person in their lifetime.\n\nIf the program is successful, we'd see 200,000 new HIV infections and 130,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide in 2030 \u2014 90% fewer than in 2010 . While eradicating the virus would require a vaccine and cure, we could eventually drive HIV infections and death rates to near zero without those tools, Abdool Karim said.\n\n\"We do have the tools to end AIDS as a public health threat. We do have the biomedical interventions,\" she said. \"The challenge is, how do we all get to that point?\"\n\nRelated: Could CRISPR cure HIV someday?\n\nMedicines known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) suppress the amount of HIV in a person's blood until it's undetectable. (Image credit: The Times / Contributor via Getty Images)\n\nFrom the first treatment to ending AIDS\n\nThe first, imperfect HIV treatment , AZT (azidothymidine), was approved in 1987. Nearly four decades and more than 40 million AIDS-related deaths later, we're still hunting for a vaccine and a cure for HIV, but our treatments have dramatically improved.\n\n\"We've had really powerful treatments, really, since 1996, but they just get better all the time,\" Dr. Monica Gandhi , director of the University of California, San Francisco Center for AIDS Research and medical director of the HIV Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, told Live Science.\n\nToday's standard treatment, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), uses several drugs to disrupt HIV's ability to replicate and invade immune cells. Given as daily pills or monthly or bimonthly injections , ART slashes the amount of HIV in a person's blood until it's undetectable. If maintained, \"viral suppression\" extends a person's life span to about that of HIV-negative people and eliminates their chance of spreading HIV via sex .\n\n\"People living with HIV, on treatment and undetectable, are not infectious \u2014 full stop, end of statement \u2014 to their sexual partners,\" Dr. Raphael Landovitz , co-director of UCLA's Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services, told Live Science. Viral suppression also nearly eliminates HIV spread to babies during pregnancy or childbirth , greatly reduces spread via breastfeeding and likely lowers spread from sharing syringes.\n\nWe also have powerful medicines that prevent HIV-negative people from contracting the virus if exposed. Known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), these drugs are available as daily pills. There's also an injectable drug called cabotegravir (brand name Apretude) that's given bimonthly. Some African countries have also licensed a vaginal ring for HIV prevention ; it's less effective than PrEP pills but works for a full month. And condom use and voluntary male circumcision also cut transmission.\n\nBy 2014, there was strong consensus that the drugs we had could end the AIDS epidemic. But those drugs weren't being rolled out fast enough to head off rebounds in infection, UNAIDS cautioned. At that time, models predicted that if treatment and prevention services didn't reach more people over time, the number of people with HIV would balloon to 41.5 million by 2030. To prevent this, UNAIDS set forth ambitious targets to scale up the global HIV response. Hitting these targets would prevent 28 million new HIV infections and at least 21 million AIDS-related deaths between 2015 and 2030, they projected.\n\nOne major goal, the \"95-95-95\" target, is set for 2025. Achieving it would mean 95% of people with HIV know their status, 95% of those diagnosed take HIV drugs, and 95% of those treated are \"virally suppressed,\" meaning the drugs keep them from spreading the infection via sex. This translates to around 86% of people with HIV being virally suppressed.\n\nOther 2025 targets aim to ensure that 95% of people at risk of HIV have access to prevention and that PrEP be made available to at least 10 million at-risk people.\n\nSo far, we're not on target: In 2022, only 76% of the total 39 million people with HIV worldwide were taking ART, and 71% were virally suppressed, according to the latest UNAIDS report .\n\nSo what can we do to reach 95% across the board?\n\nRelated: How are people cured of HIV? Here's everything you need to know\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nVulnerable populations\n\nA big hurdle to ending the AIDS epidemic is getting treatments to vulnerable populations, including children. In 2022, only 57% of the 1.5 million children under 15 with HIV received treatment, 46% were virally suppressed and an estimated 84,000 died of AIDS-related illnesses.\n\nThat's partly because kids aren't typically included in initial clinical trials for treatments, so there are relatively few child-friendly formulas, Abdool Karim said. The preferred treatment for children, a tablet that dissolves in water , was just approved in 2021 and has been adopted only recently in many countries . However, most other HIV drugs for kids taste bad, are difficult to swallow or must be taken several times a day, UNAIDS notes , so improving these formulations could make their HIV regimens easier to maintain.\n\nLong-acting ART options \u2014 meaning those that don't require daily pills \u2014 are nonexistent for children under 12, Gandhi said. To help make long-acting ART suitable for young children, the National Institutes of Health is supporting research into how to best adapt drugs approved for adults, she noted. But that grant opens in 2024, so it's unclear if it could make a dent before 2030.\n\nAnd even if better drugs are widely available, \"children are not going to be able to access antiretroviral therapy in a vacuum,\" said Dr. Anjali Sharma , a professor of medicine who now studies complications of HIV at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and has studied ART adherence in different settings.\n\n\"The pediatric care really has to be integrated with other services, potentially the mom's treatment or things that are going to work with the family as a unit,\" she said.\n\nRelated: Kids under 5 with HIV are dying at high rates. Here's why.\n\nThe science is a first step, but access is what will translate its true potential and value. Quarraisha Abdool Karim, CAPRISA\n\nHitting the 95-95-95 target will also require better reaching teen girls and young women, especially with prevention and testing. Nearly 1 in 6 new HIV cases in 2022 were in girls and women ages 15 to 24, many of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOnce diagnosed and started on ART, women's viral suppression rates are \"high and so are survival benefits,\" Abdool Karim said. Among all diagnosed women over 15, 82% had access to ART and 76% were virally suppressed in 2022. But starting ART first requires being tested for HIV, and testing rates remain low in hard-hit regions, particularly among teens .\n\nMany of the hardest-hit regions lack prevention programs for young women, and the few existing programs often miss girls who are not in school. Girls facing a lack of education, poverty and food insecurity have an especially high risk of HIV, as do girls with older male partners. Intimate-partner violence and sexual coercion often mean they cannot control when they are exposed to HIV. Plus, in some countries, HIV services require parental consent, which can also reduce girls' access to prevention and treatment.\n\nImproving girls' access to discreet prevention services as well as sex education \u2014 both in and out of school \u2014 will be key to reducing their HIV rates. Cabotegravir, which is \"stunningly effective against vaginal acquisition of HIV,\" could be a powerful tool for HIV prevention in women, Landovitz said.\n\nRepresentatives of HIV organizations march along Whitehall in London, England on March 18, 2023, calling for an end to the stigma that still surrounds HIV. (Image credit: Mark Kerrison / Contributor viaGetty Images)\n\nOther populations that are far from the targets include transgender people with HIV, an estimated 44% of whom are on ART, and HIV-positive men who have sex with men, who have 78% ART coverage. In addition, just 65% of HIV-positive sex workers and 69% of HIV-positive people who inject drugs take ART. Compared with the general adult population, these groups have far higher HIV prevalence, ranging from fourfold greater among sex workers to 14-fold greater among transgender people.\n\nAnd those numbers could be an undercount, as many countries don't track these populations. Punitive laws, police harassment, harsh stigma and social taboos keep many people out of HIV care, while high rates of incarceration and sexual violence also raise their risk of acquiring HIV. Lifting discriminatory policies and weaving HIV care into trusted, community-based programs will be key to reaching these demographics.\n\nRelated: Patient's immune system 'naturally' cures HIV in the second case of its kind\n\nCost barriers\n\nThe tools to end the epidemic by 2030 will work, but only if they get to the people who need them. \"The science is a first step, but access is what will translate its true potential and value,\" Abdool Karim told Live Science.\n\nFor instance, the number of people taking PrEP pills rose more than tenfold from 2019 to 2022. But cabotegravir, a potential game changer, is not yet widely used due to its high cost \u2014 $3,700 per dose in the U.S. The drug's nonprofit price will be around $30 a dose, the drug's maker recently told the South African news outlet Bhekisisa , and generic versions will be manufactured in coming years . But the current high price means HIV programs have yet to fold cabotegravir into their budgets, Landovitz said.\n\n\"There's still not a drop of cabotegravir to be had anywhere in Africa,\" where some of the highest rates of new HIV infections occur, Abdool Karim said.\n\nAnd regardless of the type of ART they take, a patient should have their viral load checked regularly . In 2022, 21 million people underwent routine viral-load testing, up from 6 million in 2015. Viral-load tests are expensive, though, so proxy measures \u2014 such as a urine test Gandhi and colleagues designed to track ART levels \u2014 could help fulfill the same purpose cheaply.\n\nIn addition, an estimated 25% of people stop ART treatment, sometimes for six months or more, often because they face stigma, can't get to the clinic or can't afford treatment. These individuals, many of whom come from vulnerable populations, represent a growing proportion of the AIDS cases seen in hospitals.\n\n\"That is preventable and avoidable and really represents a failure on many levels,\" Sharma told Live Science. \"But the failure isn't really the drug itself.\" It's a failure of the support system that could keep people on ART, she said.\n\nRelated: HIV may hide out in brain cells, ready to infect other organs\n\nSuccess stories and further work\n\nDespite the hurdles, some countries are well on their way to meeting UNAIDS' goals. Botswana, Eswatini, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe have already hit the 95-95-95 target set for 2025, and an additional 16 countries are close to reaching these milestones.\n\nThe U.S. trails behind. In 2021, 75% of the people diagnosed in the country received \"some HIV care,\" and 66% were virally suppressed. Men who have sex with men made up the highest proportion of new infections in the U.S., with Black, Hispanic and Latino populations predominantly affected.\n\nCountries that have hit the 95-95-95 targets offer universal, free ART access, Landovitz noted, while the U.S. government only has programs to help cover uninsured people's HIV treatment . Racism, homophobia and transphobia often keep people from getting care, he said. And especially in urban centers, people dealing with housing insecurity, substance use and mental health issues struggle to access ART consistently , Gandhi said.\n\nEastern Europe and Central Asia also lag far behind, with just 51% of people with HIV getting ART and less than half being virally suppressed.\n\nRelated: Oldest 'nearly complete' HIV genome found in forgotten tissue sample from 1966\n\nBeyond 2030\n\nWe face many obstacles on the road to ending the AIDS epidemic \u2014 but we do hold all of the tools to get there, Abdool Karim, Sharma, Gandhi and Landovitz agreed. By using those tools effectively, we could begin to meaningfully drive the number of new HIV infections toward zero. At that point, HIV would become a manageable, chronic disease of the elderly.\n\nAlready, about a quarter of people with HIV worldwide, and about half of adults with HIV in Western and Central Europe and North America, are at least 50 years old. \"They're growing older with HIV; they're not dying from HIV or AIDS,\" said Sharma, whose research focuses on aging populations with HIV.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the quest for an HIV vaccine or cure is any less important, even if neither is likely to materialize in the next seven years, Abdool Karim said.\n\n\"We need to continue our investments to find a vaccine, to find a cure,\" she told Live Science. \"Because that will then say, 'That's it.'\""

    "body": "The US is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world. By virtue of its size, its ideal IP protection laws, and deep-pocketed insurers, most of the cutting-edge innovation in pharma tends to be concentrated here. For investors and general readers alike, one should be abreast of the latest pharmaceutical innovation taking place overseas. Will a weight loss pill be a reality? When will HIV be cured? What is the future of cancer treatments?\n\nIndian investors can access growth in manufacturing, banking, commodity, services or even IT in Indian markets; but for cutting-edge tech and pharmaceutical exposure, the US is the place to look to.\n\nHere, we highlight the largest unmet needs in medicine currently being addressed by US Big Pharma, such as Merck, Gilead, Eli Lilly, and also by big players based in Europe \u2014 Novo Nordisk and Roche.\n\nWe also lay down the basic framework for investing in or assessing US pharma and the stocks that are in focus currently.\n\nOncology\n\nFrom plain chemotherapy, to surgery, to radiation and now immunotherapy, cancer treatment has come a long way. Immunotherapy, as the name suggests, is a pharmaceutical way of using the body\u2019s immune system to eradicate cancer cells.\n\nPembrolizumab (Keytruda) approved in 2014 is the first major Monoclonal anti body or mAB from Merck. The product has raked in approvals for several cancers and has generated $20 billion in sales in 2022. This works by helping T-cells find and attack cancer cells. The PD-1 protein on T-cells is deactivated by PD-L1 protein found on the surface of a cancerous cell. Keytruda and Opdivo (from Bristol-Myers Squibb) that target PD-1 and Tecentriq (a PD-L1 inhibitor by Roche) can stop T-cells from switching off \u2014 by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between a cancer cell and a T-cell. This allows for normal immune action on cancer cells.\n\nHowever, mABs have not had a high success rate. Treatment-resistant patient cohorts to mABs stood considerably high at 70-80 per cent.\n\nCombining the chemo route of toxicity and mABs\u2019 targeted actions on cancer cells are Antibody Drug Conjugates or ADCs. These rely on an mAB to target cancer cells and then release the cytotoxin into the cancer cells. The link to join the mAB and the toxin makes ADCs a three-part drug.\n\nThe three parts involved in this process, along with the fact that several mABs are available, have opened the ADC market. Compared to mABs, ADC market is dominated by smaller players. Gilead acquired Immunomedics for $20 billion for its leading ADC - Trodelvy; Roche\u2019s leading drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) for breast cancer is now paired with a cytotoxin and branded as Kadcyla, which is expected to generate peak sales of $3-4 billion over the next two years. Merck paid $4 billion in upfront payments to Daiichi Sankyo to collaborate on ADC. The US FDA has approved 10 ADCs for cancer treatment, and more than 80 ADCs are under clinical trials.\n\nAnother route of targeting cancer cells is CAR-T therapies. From the blood drawn from the patient, T-cells are isolated and collected. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which can affect cancer cells, are then induced in these T-cells. This is done by infecting them with a nullified virus that is engineered to generate CARs. Such cells are cultured to multiply and then reinfused into the patient\u2019s blood stream. For instance, leukemia and lymphoma cancers have CD-19 markers, which are targeted by the CAR-T cells and then they do their job of destroying the cancer cells. This segment has also witnessed significant M&A with Celgene acquiring Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion and Gilead acquiring Kite Pharma for $12 billion.\n\nThese novel approaches may also address the shortcomings in hematological cancers (blood) which have not faced as much success as in solid cancers.\n\nDiabetes\n\nAntidiabetic treatment kicked off with the discovery of the first animal-made insulin around a century ago. From there, innovation brought forth insulin synthesised from humans, synthetic insulins, longer and shorter acting insulins.\n\nApart from pills and the ever-reliable metformin, three leading categories operate in anti-diabetes. There are Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP-IVs Januvia/Janumet), Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2s Jardiance, Farxiga) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs Trulicity, Victoza, Ozempic).\n\nGLP-1RA is inching over the other categories with improved glycemic control in clinical trials. With positive impact on non-glycemic aspects as well including weight loss, cardiac events and kidney functions, GLPs will witness more product innovation and R&D commitment in the short term.\n\nGLP-1 is a normal peptide released by the intestine in response to a meal. This binds to GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and activates insulin production, which is impaired in Type-2 diabetes patients. GLP-1 receptor agonists are external agents that bind to the GLP-1 receptors and elevate insulin secretion by the pancreas. But, GLP-1 receptors are also found in kidney, lung, heart, skin, immune cells, and several other tissues. This allows GLP-1RA to attain a multi-modal result, which improves cardiac and renal outcomes, and aids weight loss slower gastric emptying by binding to intestinal receptors. This feature separates GLP-1RA from other modes.\n\nTreatment regimens are now not just restricted to glycemic control. Novo Nordisk\u2019s Semaglutide, a leading GLP-1RA regimen, has shown in studies that it can reduce an adverse cardiovascular event by 20 per cent in overweight patients. In Type-2 diabetes patients, Sema\u2019s study to show improved outcomes in chronic kidney disease was successful even on interim analysis.\n\nSemaglutide, branded as Wegovy, showed a 17-18 per cent weight loss sustained over 68 weeks\u2019 trial for obese patients treated with Wegovy. This has created a flutter as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and others have joined the race in the category.\n\nConvenience is another important dimension on which anti-diabetes treatments place a significant weight. Once-a week insulin, Ozempic, has been approved and once-a-week long-acting basal analogue is in the works. With frequent insulin injections being a primary complaint in diabetes treatment regimen, Novo Nordisk has also launched a pill version of its GLP-1RA, Rybelsus.\n\nHIV\n\nFrom being a near-fatal prognosis, HIV is now a chronic condition with near-normal life expectancy. The first antiretroviral therapy (ART) started with azidothymidine in the late 90s, which belongs to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of medications. The current regimen is a combination of NRTIs, nonnucleoside NRTIs (NNRTI), protease and integrase inhibitors and casts a heavy pill burden, apart from side effects. ART therapy is focused on limiting viral replication at several levels of cell development. NNRTI and NRTI act at the cellular level, protease inhibitors work at the maturation phase, integrase inhibitors at the integration phase of the viral lifecycle.\n\nTruvada is the first approved PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) treatment for those at risk of viral exposure. These work at very early stage of viral exposure and have found high success when taken regularly in the pill form.\n\nHowever, treatment resistance to ARTs from prior exposure is an increasing concern in HIV patients. Gilead\u2019s Lenacapavir, approved last year, is a single-pill treatment regimen for patients with multi-drug resistance to ART regimen. This formulation also addresses the pill burden with a single pill.\n\nThat said, by limiting viral replication, ARTs, by design, cannot cure or lead to remission of HIV. There is hope, though. By pinpointing a cohort of patients whose viral load was under control with limited treatment, researchers have identified broadly neutralising antibodies or bNAbs as a potential cure for HIV. Antibodies deal with viruses but fail to do so in HIV infection. By engineering bNAbs in a manner similar to mABs for cancer or vaccines (where antibody reaction to neutered virus generates immune protection), HIV cure may be on the horizon.\n\nGilead\u2019s several Phase-2 programmes with ART combination are in progress. Studies as recently as February 2023 presented proof of concept \u2014 90 per cent participants showed virological suppression at 26 weeks. Incidentally, Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni were the first cures for Hepatitis C. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eradicate the virus by 2030.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s\n\nThe degenerative disease of the brain has proved to be a difficult challenge for pharmaceutical companies. Leqembi (lecanemab), developed by Eisai in collaboration with Biogen, was the first and only approved drug for Alzheimer\u2019s in July 2023. This comes after several failed attempts, and one controversial false start in the recent years.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is characterised by amyloid beta deposits on brain cells leading to shrinking and loss of cognitive abilities. Despite a clear marker of amyloid plaques and a target area to work on, pharma companies failed to address plaque removal or a statistical improvement in cognitive functioning after plaque removal, till the recent approval. Pfizer, Eli lilly, Merck and many others faced failure in the space. The amyloid theory itself was in question.\n\nBiogen\u2019s adacanumab had a peculiar start. The company itself stopped development in 2019, but it surprisingly pursued a high-dose study into 2021. Later, FDA approved adacanumab with an accelerated approval for high-dose version, which faced sharp criticism. Three advisers resigned over the approval of the drug that could have cost $56,000 per annum to administer. However, with a \u201ctraditional\u201d approval for Eisai-partnered lecanemab for Alzheimer\u2019s (compared to accelerated approval for adacanumab), Biogen has the first approved treatment, putting adacanumab on the backburner.\n\nCognitive function improvement is a critical marker for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment and lecanemab delivers lower degeneration compared to placebo on this count. The treatment reduced clinical decline by 27 per cent at 18 months on clinical dementia scoring and on daily living scale delivered a 37 per cent improvement compared to placebo. As is evident, the development is satisfactory but a lot more progress is left to be made on Alzheimer\u2019s treatment curve.\n\nTakeaways for Investors\n\nAnalysing pharma stocks in the US rests on three factors: drugs about to expire, drugs in ramping up stage and the pipeline. With sharp fall post genericisation, drugs about to expire will be a major overhang for any company, without a portfolio in ramping up stages. Pipeline products cannot really offset absence of products in ramp-up stage, as pipeline assets are given lower probabilities of success. Generally, Phase-I/II/III assets get 10/20/50 per cent probability of success.\n\nSo a good pharma stock should have low impact from expiries and fairly distributed pipeline. Along such lines, we earlier recommended Novo Nordisk (+140 per cent since July-21) and Abbvie (+27 per cent since Oct-21). We reiterate the recommendation on two stocks which are now trading at 31 times and 12 times FY24 earnings.\n\nNovo Nordisk, with sales ramp-up in weight loss, pill format and weekly injections of GLP-1RA, is well poised to grow even now. The pipeline will address NASH (untreated liver disease), hematology and other non-diabetic areas as well.\n\nAbbvie, despite Humira\u2019s patent loss by end 2023 ($22 revenue billion in 2022) will continue to be powered by Rinvoq and Skyrizi in autoimmune, apart from deep pipeline assets. The Allergan acquisition, funded out of the cash flows from Humira as a replacement for Humira, can cushion the patent loss to an extent.\n\nAnalyst focus for Merck (12 times FY24 EPS) will start shifting to Keytruda\u2019s likely patent loss in 2028. Despite the overhang, investors can accumulate the stock on dips. The deep pipeline powered by Keytruda combinations in immunology, ADC and other cancers, and the balance sheet strength should support Merck\u2019s stock. While biosimilar launches will impact Keytruda\u2019s sales in 2028, the rate of decline may be lower owing to strong physician preference for Keytruda.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is the pipeline valuation. Here\u2019s an example of how it is done. For instance, Biogen (and Eisai\u2019s) Leqembi for Alzheimer\u2019s (AD) is expected to generate peak sales of $7 billion by 2030. It has announced a list price of $26,500 for annual course and we assumed 50 per cent rebate to insurers on average here. Considering the 6 million patients in AD in the US, assuming 50 per cent are mild to moderate (applicable group according to FDA label) and 15 per cent on treatment by year 7, the drug alone can rake in $12 billion (halved to account for Eisai\u2019s share) by 2030 in cumulative sales for a company whose market cap is $33 billion trading at 14 times FY24 EPS."

JackJumpers, who trailed by seven at three-quarter time, kept alive their record of winning every fourth term this season, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nBrisbane captain Sobey led from the front as defensive specialist Mitch Norton kept Tasmania\u2019s import Crawford (16 points) relatively quiet until the final period.\n\nTyrrell Harrison and Josh Bannan (10 points each) were important for the Bullets, while Chris Smith (11) and Isaac White (10) gave solid contributions off the bench.\n\nThe gut-wrenching loss ended a horror round five for the JackJumpers, who lost at home to Melbourne United before going down to the Bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt left them with a 4-4 record after a strong 4-2 start to the season.\n\nMcVeigh (18 points) and Deng (17) gave strong offensive contributions for Tasmania, who lost Marcus Lee for the final few minutes after the starting centre fouled out.\n\nTaipans import injured in win over Kings\n\nA nasty back injury to first-year import sensation Patrick Miller has marred the Taipans\u2019 otherwise impressive 87-80 win over Sydney at the Cairns Convention Centre.\n\nMiller, who entered Saturday night\u2019s clash ranked second in the NBL in scoring and fourth in assists, had the hosts in control before an explosive drive to the bucket ended with him crashing to the floor, 1:09 out from halftime.\n\nThe American\u2019s head whip-lashed onto the floor before he got up gingerly and walked slowly to the bench holding his lower back, unable to continue.\n\nStepping up were acting skipper Bul Kuol (24, played all 40 minutes) and big Sam Waardenburg (22) for the Snakes, who shrugged off last Thursday\u2019s buzzer-beating heartbreak in Illawarra by taking the NBL\u2019s most prized scalp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt shot them from fifth to third on the ladder, while sending the Kings slumping from second to fourth.\n\n\u201cWe kept moving down the bench to bring guys in,\u201d Cairns coach Adam Forde said. \u201cEveryone responded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy for the group that they could fill some short-term reward with a win at home.\u201d\n\nEx-Taipan Kouat Noi (18 points) top-scored for the visitors, while Jaylen Adams (13) and DJ Hogg (13) \u2013 playing against his former side in his long-awaited debut for his new team following a shoulder injury \u2013 got on the scoresheet, but both shot under 30 per cent, embodying the Kings\u2019 rocky evening.\n\nThe two-time reigning champions were all at sea early, out-rebounded 18-6 in the opening term while missing their first 15 three-pointers.\n\nCairns boosted their 26-20 quarter-time buffer to 12 points shortly before Miller\u2019s night ended in stomach-churning style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe injury left their backcourt stocks further depleted, with Taran Armstrong (foot) and captain Tahjere McCall (family reasons) already missing.\n\nWithout Miller running the point, the home side\u2019s offence suddenly looked shaky in the third term as Sydney briefly took the lead on a Hogg triple.\n\nThe undermanned Taipans responded with a 15-0 burst either side of three-quarter time, highlighted by Swedish young gun Bobi Klintman\u2019s thunderous dunk down the middle over rival Next Star Alex Toohey.\n\nDown by 14, Sydney closed the gap to four points before unsportsmanlike fouls against Denzel Valentine and Makuach Maluach ended their revival.\n\nLamenting \u201cthe defensive mistakes that we made\u201d, Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah added: \u201cThey made more plays than we did, they got to the 50/50 balls and they stuck together.\n\n\u201cKudos to them, they deserved it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoenix hold off fast-finishing Breakers\n\nSouth East Melbourne Phoenix have survived a massive late scare to clinch a tense 103-100 victory over the fast-finishing New Zealand Breakers at John Cain Arena.\n\nThe Phoenix were eyeing off a percentage pile-on when they led by a whopping 26 points on Saturday before the bottom-placed, injury-hit Breakers produced a brave rearguard to almost pinch a miracle.\n\nThe Phoenix\u2019s big four \u2013 Alan Williams (21 points, 13 rebounds), Mitch Creek (20 points), Gary Browne (18 points, eight assists) and Will Cummings (16 points, all in the first half) \u2013 led the way but the final stages got too close for comfort.\n\nElectrifying American point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright (33 points, eight assists) and Finn Delany (21 points) were instrumental in the 32-19 fourth-quarter fightback from the Breakers, who were brave despite succumbing to their fourth successive defeat.\n\n\u201cWe were one lucky bounce away from winning this game,\u201d NZ coach Mody Maor said. \u201cOur guys are doing everything they can and everything I ask of them everyday. \u201cThey are working as hard as can be. Our fans should be proud of the level of effort our guys put in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey were without import power forward Zylan Cheatham, who suffered a broken foot in last Thursday\u2019s loss to Adelaide, and Williams duly proved a beast in the low block against the undersized Anthony Lamb.\n\nBehind Williams\u2019 dominance and Browne\u2019s ball-handling and playmaking wizardry, the Phoenix pulled ahead 31-21 at quarter-time.\n\nCummings scored at will in the second stanza before Creek inspired a 16-0 third-quarter burst for the home side, whose advantage swelled to 80-54.\n\nNZ reverted to a zone defence and centre Mangok Mathiang impacted at both ends as the Breakers went 17-2 either side of three-quarter-time to haul themselves back into the contest.\n\nQuicksilver Cartwright-Jackson poured in 10 points inside three minutes to reduce the margin to three points down the stretch before Williams\u2019 hook and Browne\u2019s free throw iced it narrowly.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating to see the lead dwindle,\u201d Phoenix coach Mike Kelly said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a win. The guys are going in the right direction. \u201cI\u2019m not disappointed, I\u2019m stoked.\u201d\n\nBullets shoot down weakened Wildcats\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brisbane Bullets have shrugged off the absence of two important players to outwork the Wildcats at their home RAC Arena in Perth and produce a performance full of heart for their 84-79 NBL win.\n\nBoth teams were 2-4 coming into Friday\u2019s match and on losing slides, but it was the Wildcats who had the pressure building, even with the Bullets being without key pair, the suspended Aron Baynes and injured Shannon Scott.\n\nBrisbane scored the first seven points before opening up a 20-point lead in the third quarter and going on to win by five after holding out against a furious late charge from the home team.\n\nThe team effort of the Bullets was outstanding as they got another 17 points from captain Nathan Sobey.\n\nChris Smith put up 16 points, Josh Bannan 15 and Tyrell Harrison 12 to go with five rebounds and three blocks in just 14 minutes.\n\nFirst-year Bullets coach Justin Schueller couldn\u2019t have been prouder of his team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a big game for us having dropped four, with two marquees out and we knew we had to come in here and play near a perfect game,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy initial thought is just pleasure in how the guys stuck to a plan, and found our advantages consistently throughout the night.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats missed 18 of their first 19 three-point attempts before making a couple midway through the last quarter from Keanu Pinder, who finished with 22 points and five rebounds.\n\nHe was a lone shining light for a Wildcats team, who have lost four straight. Again, superstar Bryce Cotton struggled to 10 points and five assists on 3-of-19 shooting.\n\n\u201cMy words during the week were that we\u2019re just not playing good, that showed again tonight,\u201d Perth coach John Rillie said.\n\n\u201cOur offence isn\u2019t functioning very good right now. We\u2019re doing a great job holding teams to scores where we could put enough points on the board to win, in saying that we\u2019re not doing that.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly something we have to address and resolve here pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrisbane, who were on a four-game losing streak, started with the game\u2019s first seven points and were still leading 20-9 by the end of the first quarter.\n\nWhile the Wildcats had their moments in the second quarter, Brisbane did well to lead 42-36 at the long break.\n\nIt was 17-year-old Rocco Zikarsky who stood tall in the paint in the third quarter with Harrison in foul trouble.\n\nSobey and Smith then knocked down shots as the Bullets lead ballooned to 20.\n\nThe Wildcats did make a charge with a Pinder-inspired 11-0 run in the fourth to cut the deficit to three, but the Bullets answered with strong inside finishes from Harrison and Bannan to secure the win.\n\nUnited flex muscles in road win over JackJumpers\n\nMelbourne United have had to withstand a hot start and finish from the Tasmania JackJumpers but in between were outstanding on the way to a 90-82 victory in the NBL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe league\u2019s top two teams locked horns at a sold out MyState Bank Arena on Friday night and it was the JackJumpers who raced out of the blocks with a 17-4 start, but United took control from there.\n\nMelbourne led by as many as 16 points midway through the fourth quarter on the back of a three ball from Luke Travers (14 points, 13 rebounds), having outscored the JackJumpers by 78 points to 49 after the first five minutes.\n\nThe JackJumpers pulled off a remarkable comeback on Melbourne back in round two and got as close as four points in the final minute, but United held firm for a fifth straight win to stay on top at 7-1.\n\nDean Vickerman was celebrating his 300th game coaching in the NBL, and the Melbourne boss was full of praise for his team.\n\n\u201cTonight was a little bit like my career,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start great but once we found our rhythm and especially the way we came out of the half and had a great third quarter, and held on down a few players at the end there. But we held on.\u201d\n\nNBA and NBL champion Ian Clark top-scored with 19 points, with rookie Kyle Bowen adding a career-best 17 as did Jo Lual-Acuil along with 10 rebounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack McVeigh led the way for Tasmania with 20 points and seven rebounds, with Jordon Crawford contributing 16 points and four assists, and Milton Doyle 12 points and five assists.\n\nTasmania coach Scott Roth was philosophical afterwards, having given up 18 offensive rebounds and lost the battle on the glass by 16.\n\n\u201cWe got a little uncharacteristic with our shot selection, which was a credit to them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen they beat us up on the glass. It\u2019s just little things when you get in those kind of games that are going to make the separation points.\u201d\n\nThe JackJumpers opened up on fire, racing to a 17-4 lead inside the opening five minutes including three balls to Crawford and McVeigh, but United soon steadied and it was the introduction of Lual-Acuil that inspired it.\n\nMelbourne would close the quarter outscoring Tasmania 17 points to four before three-pointers midway through the second stanza from Bowen and Clark put them up five.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited were still leading 43-42 at halftime, on the back of 11 extra rebounds and 10 second-chance points, before captain Chris Goulding opened his account at the start of the second half from downtown.\n\nClark hit his second long ball of the game soon after to push Melbourne\u2019s lead out to nine, his third stretched it to double-figures and Bowen landed two surprise ones of his own.\n\nThe United lead grew to 16 before the JackJumpers showed their trademark fight with a 14-2 run \u2013 but they couldn\u2019t quite complete the job.\n\nHarvey\u2019s Hawks buzzer beater sinks Taipans\n\nIllawarra Hawks import Tyler Harvey has sealed an 84-83 upset defeat of the Cairns Taipans with a clutch three-pointer in the final seconds at WIN Entertainment Centre.\n\nStaring down the possibility of a 1-5 start to the NBL season, last year\u2019s wooden spooners looked intent on staging an ambush on Thursday night as captain Sam Froling fired early.\n\nBut the Taipans chased down a 13-point lead and edged in front in the final quarter, with Patrick Miller (24 points, seven assists) leading the charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiller\u2019s jump shot in the final 10 seconds gave the Taipans a two-point lead that looked as though it could have been match-winning.\n\nBut the Hawks belted down the court and the ball found itself in Harvey\u2019s hands for their final roll of the dice.\n\nHis deep three swished through the net with one second remaining, sending the home crowd into raptures and improving the Hawks to 2-4.\n\n\u201cI turned around to my assistants and I said, \u2018That\u2019s why we have him (Harvey)\u2019,\u201d said Hawks coach Jacob Jackomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that people can be reminded how special he is at the end of the clock.\n\n\u201cIn that space, he always gives us a chance.\u201d\n\nThe Taipans are now 2-2 to start the season, having also dropped their two games against NBA sides as part of that league\u2019s pre-season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tall order to expect us to win if we keep giving up second-chance points,\u201d said Taipans coach Adam Forde.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to discredit Illawarra (but) during the game, I felt like we were better-equipped to close it out, but we didn\u2019t and Illawarra did. It\u2019s the one that got away.\u201d\n\nNine first-quarter points from Froling helped the Hawks to a nine-point lead at the first change.\n\nFroling (16 points, 13 rebounds) had his double-double with seven minutes remaining in the third quarter.\n\nBut Cairns did a better job at targeting him later on, keeping the rangy centre scoreless in the second half.\n\n\u201cHe had a great game,\u201d Jackomas said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImport Justin Robinson, who had struggled from the field to begin the season, hit a three that forced a timeout and restored a game-high 13-point lead in the third quarter.\n\nBut lapses in concentration threatened to cost the Hawks.\n\nThey invited Cairns back into the game by shooting only one of their last nine attempts from the field in the third quarter, having gone almost four minutes without scoring from the field in the second.\n\nAfter the break, a free-throw from Sam Waardenburg tied things up, one of nine occasions in the final quarter alone that scores were level.\n\nIt took Harvey\u2019s moment of magic to split the sides late.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy for the guys,\u201d Jackomas said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of a relief, but we need to move on into being a basketball team now, not the team that\u2019s relieved to win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really confident in these guys.\u201d\n\nCheatham injured as 36ers upset Breakers\n\nThe New Zealand Breakers face a nervous wait after losing import Zylan Cheatham to a leg injury in the 97-85 upset loss to the Adelaide 36ers.\n\nWithout a hand being laid on him, ex-NBA forward Cheatham pulled up sore changing direction early in the fourth quarter at Auckland\u2019s Spark Arena on Thursday night.\n\nCheatham was unable to put weight on his right leg as Breakers staff helped him from the floor.\n\nHe played no further part in the match, but there was no immediate update on his condition after full-time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early. We\u2019ll pray for good news,\u201d said Breakers coach Mody Maor.\n\nAny long-term injury would be troublesome for last season\u2019s runners-up, who have begun the campaign with only one win from four games.\n\nCheatham\u2019s injury proved a turning point. The Breakers had maintained a slim lead for most of the night as Cheatham (17 points, eight rebounds) combined with guard Will McDowell-White to strong effect.\n\nBut the Sixers went on a 10-0 run straight after the American went off, then moved in front for the first time since the opening quarter.\n\nSunday Dech nailed a three-pointer to give what was then the 36ers\u2019 biggest lead of the day (seven points).\n\nThey never again trailed, clinching the final quarter 27-14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cZylan\u2019s a focal point for us in everything that we do, he\u2019s also one of our leaders, one of our best competitors,\u201d Maor said.\n\n\u201cTo see him go down like this, I think deflated us.\n\n\u201cNew team, new people, new leaders, these are the kinds of things that we need to learn to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe 36ers, tipped as possible wooden spooners in the pre-season, have now won three of their past four games.\n\nMid-season recruit Dejan Vasiljevic (24 points, five assists) took centre stage for the Sixers after Cheatham went off.\n\nThe two-time NBL champion sank his 200th three-pointer in the first half and hit three more in the fourth quarter as the Sixers broke away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough SOB,\u201d 36ers coach CJ Bruton said.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, from the juniors, to the seniors, to the pros, that\u2019s who he is and he carries that. He\u2019s got respect from everyone, not only our team, but the league.\u201d\n\nSixers big man Isaac Humphries, who starred in an upset defeat of Perth last game, had been instrumental earlier on.\n\nThe centre (17 points, 11 rebounds) used his size advantage to dominate the paint and help Adelaide remain in the game, despite giving up 10 first-half turnovers as a team. They finished with a staggering 23.\n\nThe Breakers were left to rue wayward free-throw shooting (12 from 20 attempts), which meant they were never able to open up a double-digit lead.\n\nFormer Golden State Warriors forward Anthony Lamb (25 points) is acclimatising quickly to the NBL, though the Breakers recruit had too little help as he notched nine fourth-quarter points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 AAP"

    "body": "Earlier this year, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled that Apple had infringed on two patents from medical device maker Masimo. As a result, the ITC said it would impose an import ban on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 starting December 26th. At the time it was hard to believe that this would actually come to pass: Apple gets sued all the time, and even when it loses, how often does it actually face dramatic consequences?\n\nWell, now would be one of those times. Experts say that, barring a Christmas miracle, it\u2019s unlikely that Apple will find a way to escape the ban. Case in point, the company shocked everyone yesterday when it decided to preemptively pull the watches from its online store starting December 21st at 3PM ET. And after the 24th, they\u2019ll disappear from Apple Stores, too.\n\n\u201cI think Apple sees the writing on the wall and they\u2019re preparing themselves,\u201d says Ben Levi, a partner at Levi Snotherly & Schaumberg, which has experience litigating ITC disputes.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to see Big Tech lose \u2014 and with such tangible consequences at that. There are still ways that Apple can keep the watches on sale, but it\u2019ll likely take a lot of waiting or a lot of money to make it happen.\n\nHow Apple got here\n\nThis ban is the result of a long-standing patent dispute between Apple and the medical device maker Masimo. The latter is known for its pulse oximetry tech, generally referred to as SpO2 or blood oxygen saturation in the wearable world, and it claims that Apple is using that patented technology without permission.\n\nThis particular story started about 10 years ago when Apple reached out to Masimo about a potential partnership around blood oxygen features on its wearables. Soon after, Apple reportedly poached several Masimo engineers and its chief medical officer. And then in fall 2020, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 6 \u2014 its first Apple Watch to feature an SpO2 sensor to measure blood oxygen saturation levels.\n\nThe SpO2 sensors measure blood oxygen levels and are at the heart of this patent dispute. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIn 2020, Masimo filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in the Central District of California accusing Apple of stealing trade secrets and infringing on 10 of its patents. That case dragged on and on, so Masimo then filed a separate case with the ITC in 2021. Then last year, Apple sued Masimo back, claiming the company made an Apple Watch clone with its Masimo W1 Medical Watch. Clearly, there\u2019s some bad blood here. But in this case, the important thing is that the ITC sided with Masimo. In January 2023, it ruled that Apple Watches did in fact infringe on Masimo patents.\n\nThe ITC then issued an import ban in October, as well as an order to stop selling products infringing on Masimo\u2019s patents that had already been imported. We\u2019re currently nearing the end of a 60-day presidential review period, in which President Joe Biden or the US Trade Representative (USTR) has the opportunity to veto the ban. If there\u2019s no veto by the time the review period ends, the ban will go into effect.\n\nBut will Biden actually veto?\n\nApple getting a presidential veto would be like lightning striking the same place twice.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinarily rare for the President to overturn a decision from the International Trade Commission and in my view, [it\u2019s] unlikely in this particular case,\u201d says Andrei Iancu, co-chair of the Council for Innovation Promotion (C4IP) and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, who was also the director of the US Patent and Trademark Office from 2018 to 2021.\n\nTo get a veto, a company usually has to show a public interest or health policy basis \u2014 and that isn\u2019t the case here. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the import exclusion order will be disapproved by the USTR and the president,\u201d says Smith Brittingham, partner at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP. \u201cThe only real answer would be, \u2018Well, it\u2019s Apple.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat said, Apple did manage to beat the system once. In 2013, then President Barack Obama vetoed an import ban on the iPhone. At the time, Samsung accused Apple of infringing on its cellular data patents. But in that case, according to Levi, Apple was able to make the argument that there were issues regarding fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory licensing (FRAND). The patents involved were considered standard and essential, and the Obama administration was concerned the import ban would give Samsung \u201cundue leverage.\u201d Plus, it only impacted the iPhone 4 and older models of the iPad. Newer iPhones didn\u2019t use an infringing chipset. In the case of the Apple Watch, Apple doesn\u2019t have any of these arguments.\n\n\u201cIn that case 10 years ago, Apple really rolled the dice and the pulled the rabbit out of the hat. It\u2019s very unlikely for them to do that again,\u201d says Levi.\n\nWhere does Apple go from here?\n\nA hail mary veto is unlikely, but that doesn\u2019t mean Apple is just going to accept an import ban on a $17 billion segment of its business. Apple spokesperson Nikki Rothberg told The Verge in a statement that the company was \u201cpursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.\u201d That means the watch is going back on sale one way or another \u2014 it\u2019s just a question of what path Apple takes.\n\nApple has already indicated that it plans to appeal, but appealing is a lengthy process that can take around 18 months. The company will also probably ask for a stay on the import ban, but Brittingham says that\u2019s not likely to be granted because Apple would have to prove that it would be irreparably harmed. In other words, it\u2019d have to make a convincing case that it would go out of business if it can\u2019t sell the Apple Watch.\n\nApple says it\u2019s exploring both legal and technical options to get around this import ban. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nWhile the Apple Watch is a popular product and makes up for roughly 30 percent of the smartwatch market, Apple won\u2019t go under if the Apple Watch is out of commission in just the US. It\u2019ll hurt to lose such an important market, but it can still sell all three of its Apple Watch models abroad. Similarly, the import ban wouldn\u2019t affect every Apple Watch. The entry-level SE is unaffected by the ban as it doesn\u2019t have blood oxygen sensing capabilities.\n\nThe SE points to one way for Apple to sidestep the import ban altogether. According to both Brittingham and Levi, Apple could redesign its Apple Watch to avoid the infringed patents until the appeals process is done. Theoretically, all Apple has to do is push out a firmware update that disables the SpO2 sensor and then it could go right back to importing Apple Watches for sale.\n\nAnd there are indications that Apple is actively pursuing that option. Bloomberg reports that Apple engineers are scrambling to alter the blood oxygen algorithms on the watches. The report quotes an unnamed Apple spokesperson saying the company plans to submit a workaround to the US customs agency to get the product back on shelves.\n\nDo Apple\u2019s SpO2 sensors even matter? Speaking as a wearables reviewer, removing the SpO2 sensors wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world for Apple in the short term. Apple\u2019s blood oxygen features are mostly for wellness and sleep tracking \u2014 and they\u2019re not that useful beyond determining your nightly baseline. I\u2019m willing to bet the average Apple Watch user forgets that the blood oxygen features even exist. In the case of the Apple Watch, it periodically takes SpO2 readings in the background, or you can actively take a spot check. However, Apple itself doesn\u2019t really make wide use of these metrics. It\u2019s not like how the watch uses its EKG capabilities to detect atrial fibrillation. On consumer wearables, SpO2 features generally have no medical use cases. They\u2019re essentially for \u201centertainment\u201d purposes, and we\u2019ve repeatedly reported that you should never, ever use them as any sort of replacement for traditional pulse oximeters. The only real blow for Apple is if the rumors are correct and it\u2019s working on sleep apnea detection. Losing the sensors in that instance would make developing this feature harder. However, that feature would require a lengthy FDA clearance process. That means more advanced health features like sleep apnea detection are more of a medium to long-term concern \u2014 and it\u2019s very possible that Apple will have a workaround by the time such features are ready for consumers.\n\nThat said, for this route to be successful, Iancu says it depends on the specific patent, ITC ruling, and what exactly Apple has planned as far as redesigning the product.\n\n\u201cFrom a legal perspective, whatever change Apple makes has to be significant enough to avoid the patent, and it cannot be what\u2019s called a \u2018colorable\u2019 difference. Minor changes will not be sufficient,\u201d Iancu says.\n\nBasically, Apple can\u2019t simply make a small tweak to the code and call it a day. Masimo claims that the patents are hardware related, so even completely disabling the sensor may not work depending on how the patent is written. Apple could remove it entirely from the design, but that would require mucking around with Apple\u2019s meticulous supply chain and could take some time.\n\nThen there are the options that would cost Apple some money. Apple could sit down with Masimo and hammer out a licensing deal for the infringed patents. In a New York Times interview, Masimo CEO Joe Kiani said Apple \u201chad not engaged in licensing negotiations.\u201d It\u2019s an easy-seeming fix, so why not do it? For starters, both parties have to want to settle.\n\n\u201cApple is a tough nut to crack,\u201d says Brittingham, noting that Apple is one of the most sued companies in Silicon Valley. The company\u2019s large cash reserves also make taking Apple to court a costly endeavor. Masimo, for example, has reportedly spent $60 million litigating the issue thus far. \u201cI think they tend to hold out as long as possible in order to make it less appetizing to sue Apple.\u201d\n\nThe other option is for Apple to avoid the import ban altogether. Iancu says Apple could simply decide to manufacture the watches within the US instead of overseas \u2014 but that\u2019s a significant supply chain change that\u2019s unlikely to happen any time soon.\n\nDoes this set a precedent?\n\nThis import ban isn\u2019t the only one Apple is facing. In February, the Biden administration also declined to veto another ITC import ban and cease-and-desist order stemming from a dispute with AliveCor over the Apple Watch\u2019s EKG features. Like Masimo, AliveCor argued that Apple stole its tech to develop the wearable EKG feature, thereby infringing on its patents. However, while the two cases look similar, the result of one doesn\u2019t speak to how the other will play out.\n\n\u201cEvery case is different, every patent is different,\u201d says Levi. \u201cDifferent complainants who bring up a case have got their own businesses, their own products, and those implicate a whole different set of facts.\u201d\n\nThe Apple Watch SE will remain unaffected because it doesn\u2019t have a blood oxygen sensor. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nCase in point, while the ITC granted AliveCor\u2019s import ban, it hasn\u2019t had any impact because the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that AliveCor\u2019s EKG tech isn\u2019t actually patentable. AliveCor would have to win its appeal to that ruling before any Apple Watches with EKG features would be pulled from the market for that reason.\n\nEven so, Iancu says everything is working as it ought to. \u201cThe takeaway is that the system is working as originally intended. If Apple wants to have products imported into the US, it should make sure that it comes up with its original inventions and does not infringe on other people\u2019s patented technology.\u201d\n\nUltimately, if this import ban goes through \u2014 which it\u2019s looking a lot like it will \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never be able to buy another Apple Watch in the US. As mentioned, the SE remains completely unaffected. In the short term, the ban also doesn\u2019t forbid third-party resellers from selling their inventory of Series 9 or Ultra 2. Once they run out, only then it may pose a problem if they can\u2019t buy more units from Apple."

    "body": "Imagine what Manchester United could do if Erik ten Hag hadn\u2019t already lost the dressing room. Yes, it\u2019s been another of those weeks at Old Trafford: rancour, rumour and recrimination, barbs in the press and barbs at the press, defeat at Newcastle followed by this stirring recovery against Chelsea, and the startling realisation that United are now three points behind Manchester City. It\u2019s still only Thursday, by the way.\n\nPerhaps ultimately this win only buys Ten Hag a few days\u2019 grace, a warm flume of goodwill that lasts only as long as it takes for Dominic Solanke to run through on goal for Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon. Back in the grip of crisis, back in the now-familiar lexicon of surly unsourced stories about dressing room discontent. Such is the way of things at football\u2019s most reliable content provider. This beast must always eat.\n\nBut block out the noise for just a moment, as of course United cannot, and something interesting is happening here. This was a win that felt a lot tighter than it really was: United inexplicably hanging on at the end despite enjoying 28 shots and an xG tally of 4.07. For long periods United played some of their most authentically thrilling football of the season, a doctrine of relentless attack that had Diogo Dalot flying forward from right-back even as the minutes ticked down.\n\nIt was also a game that felt more chaotic than it really was. In fact the slippery, slingy nature of the play was largely by design: United hollowing out their midfield in order to throw bodies forward, Chelsea hollowing out theirs in order to leave men up for the breakaway. It was a game that hung on United\u2019s determination to keep allowing Chelsea counterattacks, and Chelsea\u2019s determination to keep messing them up. It was a game, above all, that hung on the curious main character energy of Scott McTominay.\n\nUnited fans will no doubt note the rich irony in the fact that these days McTominay is basically doing the job they once paid Paul Pogba to do. Marauding midfield engine and late-running goal threat; the all-action superhero who can chip in with 10 goals a season and pull off slide tackles that make the highlight reels. It never quite worked out for Pogba at United, largely \u2013 if you believe his most vehement critics \u2013 on account of his hair. McTominay is a different kind of player with a different kind of skillset. But for all the undoubted leadership qualities of Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, tactically it is McTominay running the show right now: a development with numerous interesting consequences.\n\nHere he scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season. Previously he has never got more than seven. Where is this coming from? Partly from the fact that opponents have still not quite cottoned on to McTominay\u2019s goal threat, those late runs to the far post, the blur on the edge of the 18-yard box that you don\u2019t spot until it\u2019s too late. But partly, too, it is a function of how Ten Hag is using him.\n\nErik ten Hag (right) and Mitchell van der Gaag, his assistant, talk tactics during the game. Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty Images\n\nUnlike his previous more conventional midfield roles, these days McTominay basically has a licence to create overloads wherever he finds them. Against low blocks and structured defences \u2013 and nobody is remotely accusing Chelsea of possessing one of those \u2013 he provides the extra body in a tightly marked penalty area. But he also pops up in the channels, on the wing, either supporting the man in possession or offering himself for the quick switch of play.\n\nGreat times for a great guy. But, of course, if you commit a midfielder to this role, then you leave gaps elsewhere. One of the reasons Chelsea found it so easy to play through United was that, with the forwards pushed high and McTominay as the secret sauce in the final third, there were open spaces every time they played through the press. Chelsea\u2019s goal was a case in point: two simple vertical passes straight through the centre via Mykhailo Mudryk to Cole Palmer, passes that McTominay could see coming but could do precious little to stop.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps in another game United come up against a better finisher than Nicolas Jackson, who for all his talent looks like a man playing football in a hall of mirrors. This is the high-wire act that Ten Hag is enacting: a daring gamble that United will gain more going forward than they lose going back.\n\nThat once Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Rapha\u00ebl Varane come back, once he brings the defensive line up 10 yards, once Rasmus H\u00f8jlund hits some form, once Mason Mount gets up to speed, lawless abandon will begin to resemble a sustainable attacking blueprint. That he can shout down the noise in the short term while building something in the long term. Right now, in the raptured afterglow of a big win, it feels like a gamble being won. But best to come back and check in a few days, just to make sure."

    "body": "8 authors and their 8 gift book picks for this holiday season TechCrunch talked to eight authors with ties to the startup community to see which books they would gift this year\n\nBook blurbs have become a central part of the publishing industry: Who better to endorse a book than other authors and thought leaders? In that same spirit, we asked several writers to recommend books that you and other TechCrunch readers may want to gift this holiday season.\n\nRead on for recommendations from:\n\nThe responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity. This article contains links to affiliate partners where available. When you buy through these links, TechCrunch may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nJon Evans\n\nYou may know Jon Evans as a former TechCrunch columnist or from his engineering and CTO roles, but he is also a novelist. Most of his books are technothrillers painting travelers caught in tricky situations in exotic locations. \u201cExadelic\u201d is different, and not just because it\u2019s his first novel in over a decade: It is set in Silicon Valley, where a tech exec gets threatened by a rogue AI.\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cThe Steerswoman,\u201d by Rosemary Kirstein\n\nI love books which turn out to be far deeper, richer, and more thought-provoking than they originally seem, and the series of novels which begin with The Steerswoman are my go-to example of just that. Read just the first few chapters, and you\u2019ll think you \u201cknow\u201d you\u2019re reading a clich\u00e9d fantasy novel, albeit better-written and more feminist than most; two adventurer women meet in a medieval-ish tavern, in a land plagued by dragons, and commence a quest to discover the source of mysterious \u2013 some say magical \u2013 gems. You might be a bit surprised by the asides in which they begin to discuss math and physics, but still, clearly a fairly forgettable genre fantasy story \u2026 right? \u2026Wrong. Very, very wrong. Instead (and I\u2019m sorry for spoilering this, but it\u2019s impossible to write about this series without either doing so or being maddeningly elliptic) these books are some of the least fantastic, most meticulously thought-out science fiction you will ever read. More, they are a meditation on science itself, on how and why we acquire knowledge, on the repercussions of that knowledge being hoarded rather than shared \u2026 and on the inevitable(?) inequities, oppressions, and breakdowns between communities that result. They\u2019re also a whole lot of fun! Not just an ongoing puzzle to be solved, but a series of genuinely thrilling, funny, and wrenching adventures, populated by great characters, to experience from the edge of your seat. Read the first, and if you like it \u2014 and I bet you will \u2014 lucky you; the sequels are even better.\n\nKashmir Hill\n\nKashmir Hill\u2019s book \u201cYour Face Belong to Us\u201d is the story of a \u201csmall AI company that gave facial recognition to law enforcement, billionaires and businesses, threatening to end privacy as we know it.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t need to resort to (science) fiction to make it chilling; the company in question is Clearview AI, which very much exists, and its Dutch publisher describes the book as a \u201creal-life thriller.\u201d\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cThe Listeners: A History of Wiretapping in the United States,\u201d by Brian Hochman\n\nI\u2019m fascinated by the intersection of privacy and technology and how we navigate the clashes between the two. Hochman, a professor of American Studies at Georgetown, looks back to a historical moment when society was confronted with an intrusive new technology\u2014tiny recording devices and wiretaps\u2014and how new norms and laws developed to address it. To the extent that past is prologue, I found it very compelling for framing my expectations for what\u2019s to come with the newest and most shocking forms of mass data collection and use.\n\nJerry Neumann\n\n\u201cFounder vs Investor,\u201d a recently published non-fiction book, crosses two perspectives on venture-backed startups; entrepreneur Elizabeth Zalman is the founder, and veteran VC Jerry Neumann is the investor. Together, they share insights on how both sides can best work with one another.\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cHow Data Happened: A History from the Age of Reason to the Age of Algorithms,\u201d by Chris Wiggins and Matthew L. Jones\n\nTen years ago data was \u201cthe new oil\u201d. Now it\u2019s something more\u2026 read the tech news and you have to wonder if anything else even matters. As a humanist, I hope so, but I don\u2019t think you can reason about that unless you know the history. \u201cHow Data Happened\u201d is that history. Wiggins and Jones cover the idea of data from the advent of statistics through today. The book is well-researched, as you\u2019d expect from a couple of Columbia\u2019s top professors, but it\u2019s also an interesting and engaging read. It\u2019s a perfect gift for anyone who wants to know how our data-driven society got to where we are today and where it might take us tomorrow.\n\nBarr Moses\n\nBarr Moses is the CEO and co-founder of Monte Carlo, a data observability startup. She also co-wrote a technical book on the topic: O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201cData Quality Fundamentals: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Building Trustworthy Data Pipelines,\u201d sharing advice on achieving reliable data at scale.\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cDare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts,\u201d by Bren\u00e9 Brown\n\nReading a Bren\u00e9 Brown book is like tackling the Sunday crossword puzzle \u2013 equal parts challenging and rejuvenating \u2013 and Dare to Lead is no different. Dare to Lead pulls on Brown\u2019s decades of research, interviews, and experience as a professor at the University of Houston speaking with CEOs, founders, and other executives to understand what great leadership looks like and how to achieve it. She distills four key skill sets great leaders possess and highlights ways to empower employees to be courageous in the face of adversity and change. Published in 2018 before the Gen AI wave hit, Dare to Lead also addresses what human leaders have to bring to the table that AI and ML currently don\u2019t \u2013 empathy and connection. Bonus: the book also provides helpful resources to assess leadership strengths and growth opportunities that can make for a fun and informative team building activity.\n\nPolina Marinova Pompliano\n\nIt\u2019s her newsletter The Profile that led Polina Marinova Pompliano to become an author. \u201cAfter years of profiling hundreds of fascinating people, I asked myself: What distinguishes the great from the truly exceptional?\u201d This led to her first book, \u201cHidden Genius: The Secret Ways of Thinking That Power the World\u2019s Most Successful People.\u201d\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cIt\u2019s What I Do: A Photographer\u2019s Life of Love and War,\u201d by Lynsey Addario\n\nWar photojournalist Lynsey Addario has covered every major conflict and humanitarian crisis on the planet. As she sees the destruction and the pain through the lens of her camera, her images translate that intense emotion to people across the globe. Her memoir \u2018It\u2019s What I Do\u2019 is the story of how she risks her life to tell the stories of ordinary people living in extraordinarily dangerous places. In the chaotic times we\u2019re living through right now, it\u2019s a memoir that documents the human cost of war. Despite witnessing so much tragedy and brutality, she has never lost her ability to see the good in humanity. My favorite quote from the book is: \u201cI choose to live in peace and witness war\u2014to experience the worst in people but to remember the beauty.\u201d\n\nGeorgiana Laudi\n\nGeorgiana (Gia) Laudi helps SaaS businesses grow through her agency, Forget the Funnel. This is also the title of the book she co-wrote with her co-founder Claire Suellentrop, and whose premise is to present readers with a \u201ca customer-led approach for driving predictable, recurring revenue.\u201d\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cLoved: How to Rethink Marketing for Tech Products,\u201d by Martina Lauchengco\n\nProduct Marketing, particularly in tech, is one of the most foundational and yet also somehow wildly misunderstood disciplines. \u201cLoved\u201d by Martina Lauchengco is exactly the comprehensive guide the startup scene so desperately needed. She manages to strike the perfect blend of accessible and comprehensive so that everyone from founders to practitioners understand the critical role product marketing plays in successful companies and what good looks like at every stage of growth. Though I think what I appreciate the most about this book is that when it comes to marketing and driving product adoption, even though she introduces four fundamentals of product marketing, the first and most critical to get right is customer insight. This is almost unheard of given the target market for this book is an industry where engineering and scale reign supreme.\n\nScott Hurff\n\nAs a writer, Scott Hurff doesn\u2019t always write about product design; but when he does he is able to share his perspective as someone who\u2019s also a product maker and designer. It is also this intersection that nurtured his book, \u201cDesigning Products People Love: How Great Designers Create Successful Products.\u201d\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cGetting Real: The Smarter, Faster, Easier Way to Build a Successful Web Application,\u201d by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson and Matthew Linderman\n\n\u201cGetting Real\u201d is an absolute treasure from 2006 and it\u2019s still teaching me things. It was the first time anyone building in modern tech put together a practical, straightforward, all-encompassing guide for conceiving, building, shipping, and marketing web apps. Jason and David\u2019s words are efficient when they need to be, detailed when it matters, and packed full of nuance that\u2019s both unique and endearing. The book feels like it started as an internal series of posts or a handbook to help scale 37signals beyond the core team (from what I remember, Basecamp launched in 2004 and had quickly found success). Whatever the format, what lends \u201cGetting Real\u201d authenticity is the fact that 37signals used these exact techniques to ship Basecamp and find its customer base. To this day, I\u2019ve never read anything like it. It\u2019s one of those books that you can finish in an afternoon but stays with you for far longer, morphing into a reference book for the times when you need some extra perspective.\n\nJames Wise\n\nYou may know James Wise as a partner at VC firm Balderton Capital; but this London-based VC also wrote his first book, \u201cStart-up Century: Why We\u2019re All Becoming Entrepreneurs \u2013 and How to Make It Work for Everyone.\u201d Launched in the U.K. on November 23, it should make a great gift for aspiring entrepreneurs around you.\n\nBook recommendation: \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma,\u201d by Mustafa Suleyman with Michael Bhaskar"

    "body": "T-MOBILE ARENA, LAS VEGAS \u2014 Reports of Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez's decline have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nThe reigning face of boxing made it look easy as he retained his undisputed super middleweight title by dominating Jermell Charlo.\n\nAnd it wasn't even remotely close.\n\nCharlo already had a significant mountain to climb by moving up two weight classes and leaving his undisputed super welterweight status behind for the biggest fight of his career. But there are clearly levels to the boxing game and Charlo was either unprepared or unwilling to deal with one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.\n\nCharlo delivered a listless performance as Canelo bulled his way forward and tormented his opponent's body for much of the fight, scoring a knockdown in round seven to provide the only real drama of the evening.\n\n\u201cI worked the whole fight on going to the body, and then I changed it up. That\u2019s what happens when you change the punch,\" Canelo said about the knockdown.\n\nCanelo pursued Charlo and realized very quickly that his opponent was overmatched. With Charlo spending most of the fight with his back against the ropes, Canelo rumbled forward and slugged away at the body, fired an efficient jab, and landed the occasional hook to the head.\n\nThere wasn't much that Canelo could do aside from following Charlo around and looking for an opening to land power shots. That opportunity presented itself in the seventh round when a body shot was followed by a right hand to the temple which caused Charlo to take a knee.\n\nAfter that, it was a game of survival for Charlo.\n\nWith fans filtering out in the later rounds due to an insurmountable lead, Canelo appeared to become annoyed with Charlo's unwillingness to engage. The scores reflected that as Canelo won with tallies of 119-108, 118-109 & 118-109.\n\n\"Nobody can beat this Canelo,\" \"Cinco De Mayo. I'll come back and fight anybody. I don't f---ing care.\"\n\nCanelo (59-2-2, 39 KOs) successfully made his third defense of the undisputed super middleweight championship. He unified all four major titles when he knocked out Caleb Plant in November 2021.\n\nAfter suffering a hiccup when he fell short in attempting to gain light heavyweight gold against Dmitry Bivol, the 33-year-old superstar has now won three fights in a row and will wait to see what's next. The obvious choice for many is a megafight with undisputed welterweight champion Terence Crawford. However, Crawford would need to move up 21 pounds for that fight to happen and he's engaged in a potential rematch with Errol Spence.\n\nOther options appear to be David Benavidez and Jermell's older brother, Jermall Charlo.\n\nAs for Charlo, he still owns the IBF, WBA, and WBC championships and can return to the 154-pound division to defend those titles. Charlo called out Crawford, but after this performance, it is unlikely that Crawford would be interested.\n\nHere's how it all went down in Las Vegas.\n\nCanelo Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo live updates, results, highlights\n\nRound Twelve: Canelo chops Charlo with a short right. More people head for the exit. Uppercut to the body for Canelo and more people start moving to the exit. Charlo lands a left hook. Charlo continues to throw hands but eats a body shot.

Maybe that will spruce him up. More body work from Canelo. Charlo is starting to look content to survive. Charlo lands a hook but Canelo lands a combination that moves Charlo around the ring.\n\nSN Unofficial Scorecard: 10-9 Canelo (50-45 Canelo)\n\nRound Four: I don't understand Charlo's strategy here. Maybe he's waiting for Canelo to fall asleep? Canelo walks through Charlo's jab and nearly takes his head off with a hook. Canelo is banging away at Charlo with no concern about what's coming back. Canelo with a hard right hand and a left to the body. He's tenderizing the body with these hooks. Charlo is giving rounds away like he knows something we don't.\n\nSN Unofficial Scorecard: 10-9 Canelo (40-36 Canelo)\n\nRound Three: Charlo opens up with jabs.

Canelo closed the distance but still no shots landed by either fighter. Canelo lands a short left hook. Charlo begins to pump the jab to back Canelo off but Canelo is lurking. Nothing but pressure but not a whole lot else.\n\nSN Unofficial Scorecard: 10-9 Canelo\n\n11:34 p.m.: The main event is up next. Canelo Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo for Canelo's undisputed super middleweight championship. We're going to round-by-round coverage from here on out! Stay tuned!\n\nErickson Lubin takes controversial decision over Jesus Ramos in snoozer\n\nScores: 115-113, 116-112 & 117-111\n\n11:29 p.m. ET: Well, that was surprising. It felt like Ramos was in control but all three judges found a way to give Ramos the decision. Although it wasn't a great fight, it certainly didn't appear to be a close fight and it definitely wasn't one that Lubin appeared to be winning. Alas, Lubin won a fight that few will remember outside of the controversial decision.\n\n11:16 p.m. ET: Two rounds left and this crowd is fed up with the lack of action between Ramos and Lubin. Fans are more interested in watching the celebrities walk in.\n\n11:04 p.m. ET: Through seven rounds, Ramos has been in control in what has been a relatively tame affair with Lubin. Nothing much to write home about. Just a workman-like effort from Ramos as he continues to apply pressure while Lubin seems content to fight off of his backfoot. It's not great.\n\n10:24 p.m. ET: Co-main event is up next as Jesus Ramos (20-0, 16 KOs) faces Erickson Lubin (25-2, 18 KOs) in a WBC/WBA super welterweight title eliminator.\n\nBarrios claims interim WBC welterweight title with wide decision over Ugas\n\nScores: 117-108, 118-107 & 118-107\n\n10:08 p.m. ET: We had some added drama down the stretch as Barrios dropped Ugas, who appeared to be on the verge of getting stopped. Ugas spit out his mouthpiece on two occasions to slow down the beating but lost a point in the process. It didn't matter as Barrios was well ahead and secured the decision and the title.\n\n10:00 p.m. ET: The condition of Ugas' right eye continues to worsen as we head into the championship rounds. And the way that this fight is going, this could be the beginning of the end for Ugas' career if things don't turn around in the final six minutes.\n\n9:50 p.m. ET: Things are getting interesting as we head into the ninth round. There is clear damage on Ugas' right eye, the same orbital bone that was broken by Errol Spence Jr. last year. He's fought a decent fight and appeared to have rebounded after the early knockdown but he's going to have to finish strong in order to get a decision here tonight.\n\n9:26 p.m. ET: Barrios scored a knockdown at the end of round two to make this fight very interesting. Ugas walked into a stiff jab and hit the canvas. Although he wasn't terribly hurt, it'll be interesting to see how his punch resistance holds up over the duration of the fight.\n\n9:00 p.m. ET: Next is Yordenis Ugas (27-5, 12 KOs) vs. Mario Barrios (27-2, 18 KOs) for the WBC interim super welterweight championship. Ugas is back in action over a year after suffering an eye injury in defeat against Errol Spence Jr. while Barrios will have his third fight at 147 pounds.\n\nElijah Garcia stops Armando Resendiz in eight\n\n8:56 p.m. ET: Garcia finished the job in style. Although Resendiz was in the fight, Garcia's power punches were having more of an effect on him in the later rounds. Garcia dropped Resendiz with a body shot and a hook to the head in the eighth round. Garcia then took his time picking his spots as a huge combination forced the hand of referee Tony Weeks at the 1:26 mark to get his 16th victory. The middleweight division could use some new blood and Garcia might be the future of the division.\n\n8:39 p.m. ET: Through six rounds, Garcia has looked excellent against Resendiz. He's winning the combination exchanges and landing the heavier shots. Resendiz is very game and trying to build momentum off of his upset win over Jarrett Hurd, but the 20-year-old Garcia is proving to be too much for him.\n\n8:13 p.m. ET: The PPV card is kicking off with the undefeated Elijah Garcia (15-0, 12 KOs) taking on Armando Resendiz (14-1, 10 KOs) in middleweight action.\n\n7:42 p.m. ET: The early preliminary fights are all wrapped up and we're moments away from the PPV portion of Canelo-Charlo. Early on we had knockouts from Frank Sanchez and Oleksandr Gvozdyk while Terrell Gausha won a majority decision. Scroll down for the early results but stay tuned to our live coverage.\n\nThe main card starts at 8 p.m. ET | 5 p.m. PT | 1 a.m. BST | 10 a.m. BST | 1 a.m. BST | 10 a.m. AEST.\n\nCanelo Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo full card"

    "body": "This is another in our series of stories identifying new technologies and actions that can slow climate change, reduce its impacts or help communities cope with a rapidly changing world.\n\nOne up-and-coming class of tiny materials could help solve the huge problem of climate change. How? By catching climate-warming carbon dioxide out of the air.\n\nThe nano-scale materials are called MXenes (MAX-eenz). Their name comes from their structure, which is made up of alternating layers of M and X atoms. \u201cM\u201d layers consist of some transition metal. (Those atoms are bulky and can shed a variable number of electrons.) \u201cX\u201d layers contain atoms of another element, such as carbon or nitrogen.\n\nA single MXene sheet contains a few of these alternating M and X layers chemically bound to each other. It may look like MXM or MXMXM. Each sheet is typically only about 1 nanometer thick. For comparison, a sheet of paper is 100,000 times thicker.\n\nMXenes normally come as stacks of these individual sheets. The many separate sheets inside a stack add up to a huge overall surface area. It\u2019s like how the combined surface area of all the pages in a book is much larger than that of just the covers.\n\nIn fact, the total surface area contained in one gram (1/400 ounce) of MXene \u201ccan cover a football field,\u201d notes Per Persson. He\u2019s a materials scientist at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden.\n\nAtoms across MXenes\u2019 large surface areas can interact with their environment. That includes grabbing carbon dioxide, or CO 2, out of the air around them \u2014 a process called carbon capture.\n\nThe white exhaust leaving smokestacks at this coal-fired power plant in Arizona is largely steam. Not visible is the carbon dioxide gas also leaving those stacks. MXene nanomaterials could be installed at or near the top of each stack to collect much of that climate-warming CO 2 before it escapes into the open air. Miguel Sotomayor/Moment/Getty Images Plus\n\nMXenes are excellent at snagging CO 2 , Persson says. Some researchers think it\u2019s because CO 2 molecules are just the right size to fit between a MXene\u2019s tight layers. Persson suspects it\u2019s because CO 2 and MXenes like to share electrons, allowing CO 2 to chemically stick to a MXene\u2019s surface.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, MXenes chemically ignore other common gases \u2014 such as nitrogen, the most abundant gas in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This could allow MXenes to suck climate-warming CO 2 out of the air while leaving the rest of the atmosphere alone.\n\nSeveral research groups have been exploring MXenes\u2019 potential to capture CO 2 from the air. In the Link\u00f6ping experiments, \u201cCO 2 stuck to the MXene surface like refrigerator magnets,\u201d Persson says. \u201cIt was absolutely amazing.\u201d His group has shown that MXenes can sponge up as much as half their weight in CO 2 .\n\nOne large family\n\nMXenes don\u2019t exist in nature. Scientists have to make them.\n\nThis is freshly produced MXene, which normally forms a dark powder when dry. This MXene contains alternating layers of vanadium (M) and carbon (X) atoms. Karamullah Eisawi/Tulane Univ.\n\nThey do this using other labmade compounds called MAX phases. Like MXenes, MAX phases are layered crystals. But MAX phases have extra sheets of metal \u201cA\u201d that sandwich between their M and X layers.\n\nTo turn MAX phases into MXenes, scientists must eat away the A layers using a strong acid. A common one is hydrofluoric (Hy-droh-FLOOR-ik) acid. (This acid is so harsh that it can dissolve the minerals in your bones!) The treatment leaves behind just the M and X layers.\n\nSince the materials\u2019 discovery, scientists have found safer ways to make MXenes. These techniques use milder acids or bases. One such chemical is sodium hydroxide. That\u2019s an ingredient in soap. Another recent method is to use molten fluoride salts to etch away the A layer in MAX phases. No harsh compounds are needed there, although it does take high temps \u2014 up to 750\u00b0 Celsius (1,380\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n\nMXenes are the largest group of flat, sheetlike nanomaterials. Scientists refer to them as being largely two-dimensional, or 2-D. Another famous example of a 2-D material is graphene.\n\nThis diagram depicts a process to convert MAX phase materials into thin sheets of MXenes. An acid etches out all but the M layers (blue) and X layers (purple) to yield thick MXene sheets. The far right panel shows a scanning electron microscope image of the MXene. M. Ozkan et al/Chem. Oct. 4, 2023 ( CC BY 4.0 DEED\n\nMXenes have \u201cprobably the largest diversity and tunability any 2-D material can offer,\u201d says Michael Naguib. By tunable, this engineering physicist means that MXenes can be tweaked to take on different properties. Naguib works at Tulane University in New Orleans, La. He made the world\u2019s first MXene in 2011, a titanium carbide.\n\nScientists have now made more than 50 MXenes. New ones arise when scientists mix and match different M and X atoms. Each MXene has slightly different properties, from how well it conducts electricity to how strong it is.\n\nScientists can even modify existing MXenes by treating them with different chemicals. This involves covering the MXene\u2019s surface with new atoms, such as oxygen and fluorine, to change its behavior. For more than a decade, scientists have been tailoring different MXenes for use in batteries and other energy storage devices. But tweaking MXenes\u2019 chemistry can also alter their ability to collect CO 2 .\n\nIn an October 4 paper in Chem, engineers at the University of California, Riverside, reviewed the potential widespread use of MXenes. In a statement, lead author Mihri Ozkan noted, \u201cTheir unique properties make them excellent candidates for capturing CO 2 .\u201d\n\nPainting on a CO 2 -absorber\n\nFreshly prepared MXenes appear as a dark-colored powder. Each fleck contains many MXene sheets. Under a microscope, they look like loose sheets of paper. MXenes become easier to work with when scientists add this powder to water, creating an ink, says Anupma Thakur. She\u2019s a materials scientist that Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.\n\nMihri Ozkan, an engineer at the University of California, Riverside, is the lead author of the new study showing that certain MXenes can act like carbon-dioxide sponges. These nano-scale sheets can sop up that climate-warming gas from the air. UC Riverside\n\nAs ink, Thakur adds, scientists can simply paint MXenes onto desired surfaces, such as fabric, plastic or glass. Or, if a thick enough coat of MXene paint is peeled carefully off a surface, it can even become a free-standing sheet.\n\nWhen toughened with polymers, MXene films can durably separate CO 2 from exhaust gas. For carbon capture, Persson imagines fitting MXene filters atop chimneys where the exhaust from burned materials is rich in CO 2 .\n\nTo absorb CO 2 from the air elsewhere, Thakur suggests putting stacks of MXene screens out in the open. This method would be less efficient at capturing CO 2 , though, since average levels of CO 2 in the air far from pollution sources are quite low.\n\nKeep in mind, trapping CO 2 anywhere is just a first step in managing this pollutant, says Vitalie Stavila. He\u2019s a materials chemist at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif. \u201cThe problem is, what are you going to do with all that CO 2 ?\u201d he says. Scientists will have to figure out how to retrieve the trapped gas from the MXenes after they\u2019re full.\n\nMXenes could be heated up to release their CO 2 for long-term storage somewhere else. Flushing MXenes with a different kind of gas, such as hydrogen, might also remove the CO 2 from them. Then the MXenes could be reused for a new round of carbon capture.\n\nMXenes could also help transform the CO 2 they capture into other useful compounds, Stavila says. That\u2019s because MXenes are catalytic. That means they can help drive other chemicals, such as CO 2 , to react. MXenes also conduct electricity. Since they like sharing electrons with CO 2 , they can ferry those electrons to other compounds.\n\nAs a result, \u201cyou can do [transformations of CO 2 ] that may not be otherwise possible,\u201d Stavila says. For instance, with a boost from MXenes, CO 2 can react with hydrogen to form methanol or formic acid. These liquids can be used as fuels to reduce people\u2019s reliance on newly mined fossil fuels, which add new CO 2 to the atmosphere. Or, better yet, these liquids can be stored somewhere to keep their carbon out of the air for good.\n\nThis diagram (cropped for clarity) shows how a dry MXene (upper left) or wet one (lower left) appear to capture and store carbon dioxide molecules (trio of black and red atoms) within its structure (in right version of each MXene). M. Ozkan et al/Chem. Oct. 4, 2023 ( CC BY 4.0 DEED\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nSince they\u2019re still fairly new, MXenes today are only used in research. Scientists have to iron out some kinks before these will be ready for use in the real world. And that will take several years, at least.\n\nOne weakness of MXenes is that they can break down and transform into other solids called oxides in the presence of oxygen. So water and oxygen make MXenes less reactive. But scientists think they can overcome this problem by tweaking MXenes\u2019 structure. Capping the materials\u2019 edges with bulky salts, for instance, could shield MXenes from damage by oxygen.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard, right now, to make large amounts of MXenes. In the lab, researchers can make only several kilograms (pounds) in a single batch. Several companies are working out how to boost batch sizes.\n\nBut Thakur points out one irony: Making MXenes for carbon capture can have a big carbon footprint. It takes a lot of electricity to get the heat needed to make them, she notes. Much of that electricity is made using CO 2 -spewing fossil fuels. It\u2019s important to make sure that the energy used to make these materials doesn\u2019t spew more CO 2 than the MXenes can later sop up. Otherwise, that would defeat their use in carbon capture.\n\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nMXenes also cost a lot to make. The high cost of making these materials would be less important if they could withstand thousands of CO 2 capture-and-release cycles. That way, scientists wouldn\u2019t have to keep making new MXenes.\n\nSo far, no one has tested MXenes\u2019 durability for stored CO 2 removal and reuse. Still, it helps that MXenes are mechanically rugged. Research has shown that certain types can be as strong as steel.\n\nThe Riverside group\u2019s new paper also points to a related family of nanosheets that may prove good CO 2 sponges. Made from MXenes, they\u2019re known as MBenes, because the \u201cX\u201d layer is made up of boron atoms. These materials are harder to make than MXenes. So most research on them has been done with math or computer models. But MBenes could have unique mechanical and electrical traits, Ozkan\u2019s team finds. And those just might help them last through many, many cycles of CO 2 capture and release.\n\nEach year, human activities spew tens of billions of tons of CO 2 into the air. That\u2019s equivalent to the weight of tens of billions of elephants. Carbon absorbers, including MXenes or MBenes, can\u2019t catch it all. As such, they\u2019re never going to replace the need for reducing emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases.\n\nStill, given the urgency of climate change, even a quick or partial fix \u2014 such as carbon capture \u2014 can\u2019t be ignored. \u201cAt this point in time,\u201d says Persson, \u201cwe need to look at all the possible solutions.\u201d And MXene-like materials are emerging as potentially important candidates."

    "body": "The European Union has warned more needs to be done to address the risks that widely accessible generative AI tools may pose to free and fair debate in democratic societies, with the bloc\u2019s values and transparency commissioner highlighting AI-generated disinformation as a potential threat to elections ahead of the pan-EU vote to choose a new European Parliament next year.\n\nGiving an update on the the bloc\u2019s voluntary Code of Practice on Disinformation in a speech today, Vera Jourova welcomed initial efforts by a number of mainstream platforms to address the AI risks by implementing safeguards to inform users about the \u201csynthetic origin of content posted online\u201d, as she put it. But said more must be done.\n\n\u201cThese efforts need to continue and intensify considering the high potential of such realistic AI products for creating and disseminating disinformation. The risks are particularly high in the context of elections,\u201d she warned. \u201cI therefore urge platforms to be vigilant and provide efficient safeguards for this in the context of elections.\u201d\n\nThe EU commissioner noted she\u2019s meeting representatives of ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, later today to discuss the issue.\n\nThe AI giant is not a signatory to the bloc\u2019s anti-disinformation Code \u2014 as yet \u2014 so is likely to be facing pressure to get on board with the effort. (We\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI with questions about its meeting with the Jourova.)\n\nThe commissioner\u2019s remarks today on generative AI follow initial pressure applied to platforms this summer, when she urged signatories to label deepfakes and other AI-generated content \u2014 calling on Code signatories to create a dedicated and separate track to tackle \u201cAI production\u201d, and quipping that machines should not have free speech.\n\nAn incoming pan-EU AI regulation (aka, the EU AI Act) is expected to make user disclosures a legal requirement on makers of generative AI technologies like AI chatbots. Although the still draft legislation remains the subject of negotiations by EU co-legislators. Add to that, once adopted the law is not expected to apply for a couple of years so the Commission has turned to the Code to act as a stop-gap vehicle to encourage signatories to be proactive about deepfake disclosures it expects to be mandatory in the future.\n\nFollowing efforts to beef up the anti-disinformation Code last year the Commission also made it clear it would treat adherence to the non-legally binding Code as a favorable signal for compliance with (hard legal) requirements hitting larger platforms which are subject to the Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 another major piece of pan-EU digital regulation that obliges so called very-large-online-platforms (VLOPs) and search engines (VLOSEs) to assess and mitigate societal risks attached to their algorithms (such as disinformation).\n\n\u201cUpcoming national elections and the EU elections will be an important test for the Code that platforms signatories should not fail,\u201d said Jourova today, warning: \u201cPlatforms will need to take their responsibility seriously, in particular in view of the DSA that requires them to mitigate the risks they pose for elections.\n\n\u201cThe DSA is now binding, and all the VLOPs have to comply with it. The Code underpins the DSA, because our intention is to transform the Code of Practice into a Code of Conduct that can form part of a co-regulatory framework for addressing risks of disinformation.\u201d\n\nA second batch of reports by disinformation Code signatories have been published today, covering the January to June period. At the time of writing only a handful are available for download on the EU\u2019s Disinformation Code Transparency Center \u2014 including reports from Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok.\n\nThe EU said these are the most extensive reports produced by signatories to the Code since it was set up back in 2018.\n\nThe EU\u2019s voluntary anti-disinformation Code has 44 signatories in all \u2014 covering not just major social media and search platforms such as the aforementioned giants but entities from across the ad industry and civil society organizations involved in fact-checking.\n\nGoogle\n\nOn generative AI, Google\u2019s report discusses \u201crecent progress in large-scale AI models\u201d which it suggests has \u201csparked additional discussion about the social impacts of AI and raised concerns on topics such as misinformation\u201d. The tech giant is an early adopter of generative AI in search \u2014 via its Bard chatbot.\n\n\u201cGoogle is committed to developing technology responsibly and has published AI Principles to guide our work, including application areas we will not pursue,\u201d it writes in summary on the topic, adding: \u201cWe have also established a governance team to put them into action by conducting ethical reviews of new systems, avoiding bias and incorporating privacy, security and safety.\n\n\u201cGoogle Search has published guidance on AI-generated content, outlining its approach to maintaining a high standard of information quality and the overall helpfulness of content on Search. To help address misinformation, Google has also announced that it will soon be integrating new innovations in watermarking, metadata, and other techniques into its latest generative models.\n\n\u201cGoogle also recently joined other leading AI companies to jointly commit to advancing responsible practices in the development of artificial intelligence which will support efforts by the G7, the OECD, and national governments. Going forward we will continue to report and expand upon Google developed AI tools and are committed to advance bold and responsible AI, to maximise AI\u2019s benefits and minimise its risks.\u201d\n\nOver the next six months Google\u2019s report states it has no additional measures planned for YouTube. But, with generative image capabilities rolling out internally over the next year, it commits Google Search to leveraging IPTC Photo Metadata Standard to add metadata tags to images that are generated by Google AI.\n\n\u201cCreators and publishers will be able to add a similar markup to their own images, so a label can be displayed in Search to indicate the images as AI generated,\u201d Google\u2019s report further notes.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft \u2014 a major investor in OpenAI which has also baked generative AI capabilities into its own search engine \u2014 claims it\u2019s taking \u201ca cross product whole of company approach to ensure the responsible implementation of AI\u201d.\n\nIts report flags its \u201cResponsible AI Principles\u201d which it says it\u2019s developed into a Responsible AI standard v.2 and Information Integrity Principles \u201cto help set baseline standards and guidance across product teams\u201d.\n\n\u201cRecognizing that there is an important role for government, academia and civil society to play in the responsible deployment of AI, we also created a roadmap for the governance of AI across the world as well as creating a vision for the responsible advancement of AI, both inside Microsoft and throughout the world, including specifically in Europe,\u201d Microsoft goes on, committing to continue building on efforts \u2014 including by developing new tools (such as Project Providence with Truepic) and inking partnerships (examples it gives include the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), to combat the rise of manipulated or AI created media; with EFE Verifica to track false narratives spreading in Spain, Latin America, and Spanish speaking populations; and Reporters Sans Frontie\u0300res to use their Journalism Trust Initiative dataset in Microsoft products).\n\n\u201cThese partnerships are part of a larger effort to empower Microsoft users to better understand the information they consume across our platforms and products,\u201d it suggests, also citing efforts undertaken in media literacy campaigns and \u201ccyber-skilling\u201d which it says are \u201cnot designed to tell individuals what to believe or how to think; rather, they are about equipping people to think critically and make informed decisions about what information they consume\u201d.\n\nOn Bing Search, where Microsoft was quick to embed generative AI features \u2014 leading to some embarrassing early reviews which demonstrated the tool producing dubious content \u2014 the report claims it has taken a raft of measures to mitigate risks including applying its AI principles during development and consulting with experts; engaging in pre-launch testing and a limited preview period and phased release; the use of classifiers and metaprompting, defensive search interventions, enhanced reporting functionality, and increased operations and incident response; as well as updating Bing\u2019s terms of use to include a Code of Conduct for users.\n\nThe report also claims Microsoft has set up a \u201crobust user reporting and appeal process to review and respond to user concerns of harmful or misleading content\u201d.\n\nOver the next six months, the report does not commit Bing Search to any specific additional steps to address risk attached to the use of generative AI \u2014 Microsoft just says it\u2019s keeping a watching brief, writing: \u201cBing is regularly reviewing and evaluating its policies and practices related to existing and new Bing features and adjusts and updates policies as needed.\u201d\n\nTikTok\n\nIn its report, TikTok focuses on AI-generated content in the context of ensuring the \u201cintegrity\u201d of its services \u2014 flagging a recent update to its community guidelines which also saw it modify its synthetic media policy \u201cto address the use of content created or modified by AI technology on our platform\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile we welcome the creativity that new AI may unlock, in line with our updated policy, users must proactively disclose when their content is AI-generated or manipulated but shows realistic scenes,\u201d it also writes. \u201cWe continue to fight against covert influence operations (CIO) and we do not allow attempts to sway public opinion while misleading our platform\u2019s systems or community about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account.\u201d\n\n\u201cCIOs continue to evolve in response to our detection and networks may attempt to reestablish a presence on our platform. This is why we continue to iteratively research and evaluate complex deceptive behaviours and develop appropriate product and policy solutions. We continue to provide information about the CIO networks we identify and remove in this report and within our transparency reports here,\u201d it adds.\n\nCommitment 15 in TikTok\u2019s report signs the platform up to \u201ctak[ing] into consideration transparency obligations and the list of manipulative practices prohibited under the proposal for Artificial Intelligence Act\u201d \u2014 and here it lists being a launch partner of the Partnership on AI\u2019s (PAI) \u201cResponsible Practices for Synthetic Media\u201d (and contributing to the development of \u201crelevant practices\u201d); and joining \u201cnew relevant groups\u201d, such as the Generative AI working group which started work this month as implemented measures towards this pledge.\n\nIn the next six months it says it wants to further strengthen its enforcement of its synthetic media policy \u2014 and explore \u201cnew products and initiatives to help enhance our detection and enforcement capabilities\u201d in this area, including in the area of user education.\n\nMeta\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta\u2019s report also includes a recognition that \u201cwidespread availability and adoption of generative AI tools may have implications for how we identify, and address disinformation on our platforms\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with partners in government, industry, civil society and academia to ensure that we can develop robust, sustainable solutions to tackling AI-generated misinformation,\u201d Meta goes on, also noting it has signed up to the PAI\u2019s Responsible Practices for Synthetic Media, while professing the company to be \u201ccommitted to cross-industry collaboration to help to maintain the integrity of the online information environment for our users\u201d.\n\n\u201cBesides, to bring more people into this process, we are launching a Community Forum on Generative AI aimed at producing feedback on the principles people want to see reflected in new AI technologies,\u201d Meta adds. \u201cIt will be held in consultation with Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab and the Behavioural Insights Team, and is consistent with our open collaboration approach to sharing AI models. We look forward to expanding this effort as a member of the Code\u2019s Task Force Working Group on Generative AI, and look forward to working together with its other members.\u201d\n\nOver the next six months, Meta says it wants to \u201cwork with partners in government, industry, civil society and academia in Europe and around the world, to ensure that we can develop robust, sustainable solutions to tackling AI-generated misinformation\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will participate in the newly formed working group on AI-generated disinformation under the EU Code of Practice.\u201d\n\nKremlin propaganda\n\nPlatforms must concentrate efforts to combat the spread of Kremlin propaganda, Jourova also warned today \u2014 including in the context of looming EU elections next year with the risk of Russia stepping up its election interference efforts.\n\n\u201cOne of my main messages to the signatories is to be aware of the context. Russian war against Ukraine, and the upcoming EU elections next year, are particularly relevant, because the risk of disinformation is particularly serious,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Russian state has engaged in the war of ideas to pollute our information space with half-truth and lies to create a false image that democracy is no better than autocracy.\n\n\u201cToday, this is a multi-million euro weapon of mass manipulation aimed both internally at the Russians as well as at Europeans and the rest of the world. We must address this risk. The very large platforms must address this risk. Especially that we have to expect that the Kremlin and others will be active before elections. I expect signatories to adjust their actions to reflect that there is a war in the information space waged against us and that there are upcoming elections where malicious actors will try to use the design features of the platforms to manipulate.\u201d\n\nPer the Commission\u2019s early analysis of Big Tech\u2019s Code reports, YouTube shut down more than 400 channels between January and April 2023 which were involved in coordinated influence operations linked to the Russian-state sponsored Internet Research Agency (IRA). It also removed ads from almost 300 sites linked to state-funded propaganda sites.\n\nWhile the EU highlighted that TikTok\u2019s fact-checking efforts now cover Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian and 17 European languages, including through a new partnership with Reuters. \u201cIn this context, 832 videos related to the war have been fact-checked, of which 211 have been removed,\u201d Jourova noted.\n\nThe EU also flagged reporting by Microsoft that told it Bing Search had either promoted information or downgraded questionable information in relation to almost 800,000 search queries related to the Ukraine crisis.\n\nJourova\u2019s speech also highlighted a couple of other areas where she urged Code signatories to go further \u2014 calling (yet again) for more consistent moderation and investment in fact-checking, especially in smaller Member States and languages.\n\nShe also criticized platforms over access to data, saying they must step up efforts to make sure researchers are empowered to scrutinize disinformation flows \u201cand contribute to the necessary transparency\u201d.\n\nBoth are areas where X/Twitter under new owner, Elon Musk, has moved out of step with EU expectations on countering disinformation.\n\nTwitter (now X) was an original signatory to the disinformation Code but Musk took the platform out of the initiative back in May, as critical scrutiny of his actions dialled up in the EU. And also today, as we reported earlier, Jourova drew attention to early analysis conducted by some of the remaining signatories which she said had found X performed the worst for disinformation ratios.\n\nThis suggests that X, which back in April was designated by the EU as a VLOP under the DSA, continues to put itself squarely in the Commission\u2019s crosshairs \u2014 including over its priority issue of tackling Kremlin propaganda.\n\nAs well as devising the anti-disinformation Code, the bloc\u2019s executive is now responsible for oversight of VLOPs\u2019 compliance with the DSA \u2014 with powers under the new law to fine violators up to 6% of global annual turnover."

    "body": "Gio Reyna looked sharp in the starting lineup for the United States men\u2019s national team, in all the ways a young man can: his unyielding energy, his surprising eagerness to cover the whole of the midfield, the periodic flashes of skill when the opportunity presented itself, even the bleach-blond hair that allowed viewers to spot him in an instant.\n\nThere was one substantial element missing from his performance, though, in an immense friendly Saturday against Germany: being able to endure from starting to finishing.\n\nIt was kind of like that for the USMNT as a whole, as they blew an early lead and fell, 3-1, in East Hartford, Conn.\n\nMORE: USMNT undone by errors in loss to Germany\n\nIt is quite possible this was the most challenging friendly the U.S. are likely to play between now and the 2026 World Cup here in North America, and so it was viewed by coach Gregg Berhalter as a significant opportunity to learn about his team. And what was learned, above all, was there needs to be an alternative approach to the midfield for whenever Tyler Adams is unavailable to play.\n\nAdams is the one proven defensive midfielder \u2014 a No. 6, as they call it in soccer jargon \u2014 on the USMNT roster. He has been absent from the national team since injuring his hamstring in the spring, and it\u2019s possible now he\u2019ll need a second surgery to address the issue.\n\nThe decision about how to replace him in the lineup was rather simple. It always was the plan for Reyna to play roughly half this game, and the obvious choice in that circumstance, given the sometimes ridiculous controversy that developed from Reyna\u2019s reserve role at the World Cup, was to have him start. The decision about how to replace Adams in the formation was complex \u2014 too much so to be resolved in one afternoon.\n\nReyna was exceptional throughout the first half: less influential than he might have been if given greater access to the ball but evincing a welcome taste for covering ground to become helpful on defense or to retrieve the ball and launch an attack. Weston McKennie was his typical self, particularly when he could connect with star winger Christian Pulisic along the left side.\n\nYoung Yunus Musah was deployed in the defensive midfield role, and it did not work. Whenever Germany were able to quell an American surge in the first half and regain possession, they plowed with ease through through the center of the park. He is elite at maintaining possession when operating as a box-to-box midfielder, and lately his club play, with Pulisic at AC Milan, has seen Musah in more of an attacking role. Even if one can argue he has the skill set to succeed at the No. 6, he did not appear comfortable transitioning on short notice.\n\nMORE: USA vs. Germany player ratings\n\n\u201cTyler\u2019s a great player. It\u2019s not nice to talk about guys that aren't here, though,\u201d Berhalter told reporters afterward. \u201cI\u2019d rather talk about the guys that are on the field.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t, though, relative to how this group filled Adams\u2019 huge vacancy. He was pleased to talk about the pressure the USMNT applied in the first half, including a ball played over the top of Germany\u2019s defense to Pulisic early in the game that was stopped by an offside call both player and coach disputed, and Pulisic\u2019s brilliant goal in the 27th minute that involved him driving to his right and blasting a curving shot while four defenders converged and ace goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen watched it sail into the upper righthand corner.\n\n.@pulisic with a SCREAMER to open the scoring \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/KlG0oMeNPm \u2014 U.S. Men's National Soccer Team (@USMNT) October 14, 2023\n\n\u201cI think we created some problems,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAnd then just the threat we had a lot in the first half was really good. It put Germany on their heels at times. But to me, it\u2019s also about controlling the tempo of the game, and that\u2019s what we really need to learn.\u201d\n\nIt was a victory of sorts for Reyna to play 45 minutes after he\u2019d gone only 27 in his one club appearance this season for Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019d been injured in June while playing for the U.S. and missed all of preseason training and nearly two months of the Bundesliga season.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to send him back to Dortmund in a really good spot,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cI think he played a good game, showed his quality. I think everyone in the first half played well. So it was good to see him, good to have him on the field.\u201d\n\nIt was not good to not have him on the field, because the collapse from a 1-1 halftime tie not only followed Reyna\u2019s departure, but probably was connected. The U.S. was able to threaten the opposing goal enough with Reyna on the field to cause the opposition to concern itself with defending more often than it preferred. Replacement Luca de la Torre dulled the attack and did nothing to dissuade Germany\u2019s rampage toward the American net.\n\nThere was plenty of blame to be shared on the goals by Niclas Fullkrug in the 58th minute and Jamal Musiala three minutes later. Sergino Dest allowed the ball to deflect off his foot and into dangerous territory at the top of the box, de la Torre became a spectator with a too-great view and central defender Chris Richards missed two opportunities to shut down the threat. McKennie, central defender Tim Ream and right back Joe Scally all bore some responsibility for the second.\n\n\u201cWhen you watch the goals back \u2014 I had the opportunity to do that in the coaches\u2019 office \u2014 it\u2019s really these fine moments, these split seconds where you need to be well-positioned, not open up any gaps in your back line,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it went wrong.\u201d\n\nWith the attempt to transform Musah into some semblance of Adams, though, it almost was certain to go wrong. The USMNT conjured a more compelling attack because of Reyna\u2019s presence, but the ability to control the game went missing.\n\nSo many national team fans sided with Reyna during the controversy that developed as the team competed at last winter's World Cup. They got what they argued for in this game, but not what they wished."

    "body": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nHere are the best Prime Day deals we could find gathered in one place.\n\nAmazon's second Prime Day-like sale event for 2023 kicked off in the wee hours this morning, and it's turning out to be a great opportunity to get holiday shopping done early. Or, if you missed out on any of the deals from Prime Day in July, this year's \"Prime Big Deal Days\" will let you make up for that. The sale has brought back many of the same steep discounts we saw during the summer as well as new sales. We've also put together category roundups for deals on headphones, tablets, TVs, video games and other gadgets. If you've got your gift list handy, now's a good time to start checking it off so you won't be pressed for time or funds when Black Friday and Cyber Monday come around next month. A few deals are just for Prime members, but many are open to anyone looking to save. If you want to take advantage of some great tech deals, here are all of the best deals we found for October Prime Day.\n\nApple AirPods Pro\n\nThe second-generation AirPods Pro have dropped to $189 for Prime Day. Apple made a ton of small but noticeable improvements to these models, so now they have better sound quality, noise cancelation and Transparency Mode. There remains no competition if you have an iPhone and live within the Apple ecosystem \u2014 these are the best earbuds to get if you fall into that category.\n\nApple Watch SE\n\nThe Apple Watch SE is on sale for $199 right now. It's the best smartwatch to get if you're new to the wearable world, or you just want a basic, relatively affordable watch that has all of the basic features you'd need. On top of comprehensive health and fitness tracking, iPhone notifications and dozens of fun watch faces, you'll get features like crash and fall detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS.\n\nApple 10.2-inch iPad\n\nApple's most affordable tablet, the 10.2-inch iPad, is on sale for $249 right now. It may have an old-school design, but it's certainly the best iPad for people on a budget and it has most crucial features you'd expect in an Apple tablet. It earned a score of 86 from us for its solid performance, sharp screen, TouchID-capable Home button and good battery life. The only major downside to this model right now is that it still sports Apple's old Lightning port rather than USB-C.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is down to $270 for October Prime Day, which is the lowest price we've seen since it came out a few months ago. You can't get a better smartwatch than this one if you have an Android phone (bonus points if you have a Samsung phone), and it's smaller and lighter than previous versions. Samsung brought back the spinning bezel on the Classic version, which is which makes the software's UI easier to navigate, plus it has improved performance and updated health and fitness tracking tools.\n\nApple iPad mini\n\nThe Apple iPad mini has dropped to $400 for October Prime Day. It's the best small tablet on the market right now and really your only option if you want a true one-hand-friendly iPad. It's powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip and sports a Touch ID-toting power button, solid cameras, a good battery life and a USB-C port for charging.\n\nSony WF-1000XM5\n\nSony's WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are on sale for $278 for Prime Day, which is their best price yet. These are the best wireless earbuds on the market right now, and Sony improved upon it's already remarkable buds with a more comfortable fit, better sound quality and features likes adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat.\n\nAnker Soundcore Space A40\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is on sale for $54, which matches its all-time low and comes in $25 less than usual. The Space A40 is the top pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds, as it includes a host of features that belie its price: adaptive ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging, a transparency mode and up to 10 hours of battery life. Its audio quality and ANC aren\u2019t quite as powerful as more expensive pairs, but both are more than effective enough for the money. Unlike many budget wireless headphones, its default sound doesn\u2019t completely blow out the bass. Just note that its call quality is mediocre, and it lacks wear detection, so it won\u2019t auto-pause when you remove an earbud.\n\nBose QuietComfort 45\n\nThe Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones have dropped to $230 for October Prime Day, which is about $80 cheaper than their usual selling price. These cans earned a spot in our best wireless headphone guide thanks to their comfortable, if a little dated, design, excellent ANC and balanced audio.\n\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro have dropped to $120 for Prime Day. The company got a lot of things right after years of making pretty standard earbuds; the Pixel Buds Pro are Google's best wireless earbuds yet. These will be great for Android users who want buds with punchy bass, good ANC, reliable touch controls and wireless charging.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot\n\nAmazon has knocked the price of the latest Echo Dot down to $23 right now. It\u2019s one of the best smart speakers you can get thanks to its orb-like design, surprisingly good sound quality for its size and handy Alexa integration. The Dots can also act as Eero WiFi boosters, adding up to 1,000 square feet of coverage to your existing Eero system.\n\nAmazon Echo Show 5\n\nThe latest Echo Show 5 is on sale for a record low of $40. The Show 5 has been one of the best smart displays available for quite some time, and it\u2019ll be particularly good for anyone who wants an Alexa-capable smart display that won\u2019t take up a lot of space. It also makes for a good alarm clock thanks to its sunrise alarm and tap-to-snooze features.\n\nAmazon Kindle\n\nThe standard Kindle has dropped to $75 for October Prime Day. This model saw a lot of improvements when it was updated in 2022. Capacity was doubled to 16GB and the screen resolution jumped up to 300 ppi for much clearer text. We named it the best budget option in our ereader guide because its perfect entry point to reading and borrowing ebooks and audiobooks.\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite, meanwhile, is down to $95 for an 8GB model. That's $5 more than it went for during July's Prime Day event but still $45 off its MSRP. The Paperwhite gets you a few extra perks over the standard Kindle, including a larger 6.8-inch screen, a more comprehensive front light and IPX8-rated waterproofing. This deal applies to the ad-supported version (which displays ads for Kindle books and services on your lock screen); it you want no ads on your device, you\u2019ll need to pay $20 more.\n\n$100 PlayStation Store Gift Card + $10 Amazon credit\n\nHere's a simple one: If you buy a $100 PlayStation Store digital gift card and use the code PSN100 at checkout, you can get an extra $10 Amazon credit to use on future purchases. If you often use Amazon and plan on picking up new PS5 games, renewing a PlayStation Plus subscription or buying any other content through the PlayStation Store anyway, it's effectively a bit of free money.\n\nBlink Mini (2-pack)\n\nA two-pack of Blink Mini security cameras has dropped to $40 for Prime Day. That's about $10 more than they went for last Prime Day, but still a decent 38 percent discount. While these cameras are wired, they have most of the same features as the standard wireless Blink cameras including 1080p video recordings and support for two-way talk and motion alerts.\n\nGoogle Indoor Nest Security Cam\n\nA slew of Google Nest home security devices are on sale, including the battery-powered Nest Cam that can go inside or outside your home. Typically priced at $180, the security cam is down to $120 for Amazon's October Prime Day event. The Nest Cam works with smart speakers and displays enabled with Alexa or the Google Assistant and can last up to seven months depending on how much activity it picks up. Its weather-resistant build and magnetic mount should make it easy to install on most surfaces. It sends live alerts to your phone and will even allow for on-demand check-ins without a subscription, though it only stores the last three hours for free. For six months of stored footage, you'll need a Nest Aware membership.\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8\n\nAmazon\u2019s Fire HD 8 is down to $60 for the Prime Big Deal Days event, which is $5 more than the tablet\u2019s all-time low but still $40 off its list price. This discount applies to the model with 32GB of storage; if you need more space, the 64GB version is on sale for $75. Either way, the Fire HD 8 is likely the cheapest competent tablet for most people: It\u2019s slower than the Fire HD 10 and its display is limited to a 1,280 x 800 resolution, but it\u2019s lightweight, it can last more than 10 hours on a charge and it\u2019s still quick enough for basic streaming and reading. It\u2019s not the best value at its standard going rate, but for $60, it\u2019s hard to do better.\n\nAmazon Fire 11 Max\n\nThe Fire Max 11 is Amazon\u2019s largest and most performant tablet, with an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 resolution display, an aluminum frame, a respectable octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM. It has the same software limitations and lock-screen ads as any other Fire slate, so it\u2019s a tough sell at its usual $230, but now it\u2019s on sale for $150, which matches its all-time low. If you already use a bunch of Amazon services and don\u2019t want to shell out for an entry-level iPad, it's a big upgrade over the Fire HD 8 \u2014 just don\u2019t expect to get any real work done with it.\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\n\nPhoto by Cherlynn Low / Engadget Google Pixel Tablet $409 $499 Save $90 The 11-inch Pixel Tablet comes with a charging speaker dock that allows it to double as a smart home hub. This deal marks a new all-time low. $409 at Amazon\n\nThe 128GB Google Pixel Tablet is down to $409, which is $90 off and a new low. The 256GB model is also on sale for $509. While we think Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S9 works better purely as a tablet, Google\u2019s 11-inch slate still gets you a sharp LCD display, a speedy Tensor G2 chip and an easy-to-hold design that weighs just over a pound. Its big hook, however, is that it can attach to an included charging speaker dock and double as a Nest Hub Max-style smart display. Android still isn\u2019t as optimized for large screens as iPadOS, but if that extra functionality sounds useful to you, the Pixel Tablet is worth a look. We gave it a score of 85 in June. (The Galaxy Tab S9, meanwhile, isn\u2019t on sale as of this writing.)\n\nGoogle Pixel 7a\n\nThe Google Pixel 7a is down to a new low of $399 for this sale event. It's the best midrange phone you can get right now thanks to its speedy Tensor G2 chip, smooth 90Hz display and support for wireless charging. The 7a also has solid cameras and an IP67 water-resistant design.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n\nThe entire Samsung Galaxy S23 series is on sale for Prime Day, including the S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra. These are some of the best Android phones you can buy right now, and we recommend springing for the S23 Ultra if you want all of the latest features from Samsung. The Ultra runs on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and has a big, bold 120Hz display, built-in S Pen and an excellent main camera.\n\nBose Quiet Comfort\n\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II have dropped to $199 for October Prime Day, which is the best price we've ever seen, though you'll need to be a Prime member to get the deal. They're currently the best wireless earbuds you can get if you want as much noise cancelation as possible. On top of that, these buds have a smaller, more comfortable fit and good audio quality.\n\nSony SRS-XB13 Extra Bass\n\nThe four-inch tall SRS-XB13 is back to $35 for October Prime, which matches its sale price for July\u2019s Prime sale. You'll need a Prime membership to get the deal, however. This is an older model of the tiny portable. Sony replaced it with the SRS-XB100 earlier this year, which is currently seeing a 20 percent discount. They're both rated for water and dust resistance and you can pair two for stereo sound.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\n\nOur favorite streaming stick, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K, has dropped to $38 for this sale. It packs a ton of features into an affordable package, including 4K HDR streaming capabilities, Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and private listening when you have a pair of headphones. And since it's so small, it makes a great travel entertainment device, too.\n\nLG B2\n\nThe LG B2 OLED TV is down to $847 for a 55-inch model. That\u2019s a new low and roughly $150 off its average street price in recent months. The B2 is the step-down model from the C2 \u2014 which is also on sale at $1,097 for a 55-inch set \u2014 as it\u2019s not as bright or color-rich with HDR content, it runs on a slower processor and it has two fewer HDMI 2.1 ports. That said, its contrast, colors and motion performance will still be a significant upgrade if you\u2019re upgrading from a more basic LED TV. LG\u2019s new B3 TV promises a cleaner webOS interface, but it\u2019s priced a good way higher as of this writing. If you want an OLED TV for less than $1,000, the B2 should be a better value.\n\nHisense U6K\n\nIf you want a more affordable TV, the Hisense U6K is also on sale, with the 55- and 65-inch models down to $400 and $548, respectively. We\u2019ve seen these deals before, but each matches an all-time low. The U6K is has received generally positive reviews around the web, as it's one of the few budget-level sets with quantum dots, full-array local dimming and a mini-LED backlight. All of that should help it deliver better contrast and color volume than most TVs in its price range. It\u2019s not ideal for gaming though, as it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks HDMI 2.1 ports. In general, it can\u2019t match the brightness or viewing angles of a more expensive set, but it looks to be a good buy if you\u2019re on a tighter budget.\n\nFor a well-reviewed mid-range model, the Hisense U8K provides much better contrast and peak brightness, and it comes with more gaming-friendly features like the ability to play 4K content at up to a 144Hz refresh rate. That one is down to $748 for a 55-inch model and $998 for a 65-inch set.\n\niRobot Roomba 694\n\niRobot's Roomba 694 has dropped to $199 for Prime Day. It's our favorite cheap robot vacuum thanks to its strong suction power, attractive design and easy to use app. It'll be a good option for robo-vac novices, or anyone that doesn't want to fuss too much with an automatic dirt sucker. It clears hard and carpeted floors well, and it automatically returns to its base once a cleaning job is finished so it can recharge.\n\nRazer Basilisk V3\n\nThe Razer Basilisk V3 is down to $44, which is a few bucks more than its all-time low but still $6 less than its usual street price. This is the \u201cbest for most\u201d pick in our guide to the best gaming mouse, as its sturdy shape should be comfortable for each grip type and all but the smallest hands. (Provided you\u2019re a righty.) It has 11 customizable buttons, including a \u201csensitivity clutch\u201d for more precise aiming, and its thumb wheel supports both left-right tilt and a faster free-spin mode. That wheel is somewhat noisy, and the whole thing is too heavy for competitive-minded players, but it still tracks accurately and glides smoothly.\n\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD\n\nThe Samsung Pro Plus microSD card is on sale for $20 right now. It's our top pick in our best microSD card guide because it was the most consistent of the ones we tested, with some of the best overall speeds and all of the important ratings that a good card should have: U3, V30 and A2. It'll be a great pick for your tablet, smartphone or Nintendo Switch, and it comes with a full-sized adapter in case you need to use it with a camera or connect it to your computer.\n\nBackbone One\n\nThe Backbone One is a well-built gamepad that snaps around the sides of your phone and works immediately with just about any game that supports controller input. It\u2019s also convenient for cloud streaming games from a console or PC. Right now both its USB-C and Lightning models are down to $70, which is $30 off. That\u2019s not an all-time low, but discounts on the device are relatively uncommon. We gave the One a positive review last year, and we currently highlight it in our guide to the best handheld gaming systems. Backbone says the USB-C models will work with Apple\u2019s new iPhone 15 lineup as well.\n\nCrucial MX500\n\nThe Crucial MX500 internal drive is on sale for $46 right now. It's been an Engadget favorite for a while thanks to its sequential read speeds of 560MB/s and a standard 2.5-inch design that should make it easy to swap in for your desktop's or laptop's used-up drive.\n\nYour October Prime Day Shopping Guide: See all of our Prime Day coverage.

    "body": "For Nicole Plauch\u00e9 and her family, Christmas is the time of the year where they can use their preferred love language: gift giving. This year, however, Plauch\u00e9 is worried about how much she can afford to spend on gifts. Her main struggle? Student loan payments.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t leave much room for anything outside of just basic necessities,\u201d said Plauch\u00e9, a 23-year old tech sales manager from Dallas, Texas.\n\nMarisa Johnson, 26, has approximately $145,000 in student loan debt from both her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. Since the COVID-era payment pause ended in October, she\u2019s been paying back $300 a month while she waits to see if she\u2019ll be enrolled in a new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nBecause all of her money is going to necessities and paying back her student loans, Johnson hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much on gifts as in previous years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve mostly been trying to think of affordable gifts or combining gifts with my older sister,\u201d said Johnson, a non-profit worker in Citrus Heights, California.\n\nPlauch\u00e9 and Johnson are just two of the millions of people who had to start paying back student loans after the Biden administration ended the three-year payment pause.\n\n\u201cWe know that the holidays are often a very joyful time of the year and an expensive one every year,\u201d said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. \u201cWith federal student loan payments just resuming, it\u2019s going to add another often very significant line item into holiday budgets.\u201d\n\nIf student loan payments are cutting into what used to be your holiday budget, here are some recommendations:\n\nTHE PRESSURE IS REAL\n\nFrom family expectations to social media and TV ads showing lavish gifts, many people feel that the only way they can show love is to spend a lot of money.\n\nBetween being a mom and a new grad with a salary to match, Plauch\u00e9 says she can barely manage her daily expenses. Still, she feels a responsibility to give her family gifts because that\u2019s how they have traditionally shown each other love.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give my family this message that they\u2019re not loved and it definitely adds a lot of pressure,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson feels guilty because the holidays are the time she feels she can show her family how grateful she is for them. She has always prided herself on being a great gift giver who not only finds something nice but knows how to spot unique and special gifts.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a little embarrassed to tell them that this year I might not be able to be a good gift giver,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nAcknowledging that you\u2019re feeling pressure is a good first step towards making a plan to set expectations and be realistic about what you can spend.\n\nBUDGET\n\nAlev is a big proponent of the 50-30-20 budgeting method, where 50% of your income is allocated for necessities like food and rent, 30% for things you want, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.\n\nTo find space in your budget for gifts, Alev recommends that you plan ahead as much as possible and only take money from the 30% portion of your budget.\n\nIf the 50-30-20 is not the right format for you, there are plenty of other budgeting methods that you can use. Whether is recording your spending on an Excel spreadsheet, using an app or writing it down on a notebook, keeping a budget is most effective when you do it in a format that works for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a budget template, Microsoft Office offers a holiday spending-focused version.\n\nCOMMUNICATE WITH YOUR LOVED ONES\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing a lot of financial pressure this holiday season, Alev recommends that you try to communicate your feelings to your loved ones.\n\n\u201cOne of the hardest things is resentment can build up if you feel like you need to buy gifts for your family and you can barely make your student loan payments, so bring things up,\u201d Alev said.\n\nSharing your financial struggles can be hard. If you want to talk but don\u2019t want to share every detail of your financial struggles, that\u2019s okay. Ultimately, what you want is for your loved ones to understand how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nPlauch\u00e9 just recently started sharing her money worries with her family.\n\n\u201cI have been open with my family, just that I\u2019m not going to be able to give gifts that year,\u201d she said.\n\nEXPERIENCES VS. GIFTS\n\nAnother great way to save money is to skip material gifts and instead, grant your time. In many cases, your family would rather spend quality time with you.\n\nAlev recommended planning low-cost activities such as a hike with your family, or attending a free event in your city. Other options can be a holiday movie marathon with your friends, a free museum with your parents or a volunteering day with your family.\n\nUSE CREDIT RESPONSIBLY\n\nSince Plauch\u00e9 is already paying her student loan debt every month, she is avoiding using her credit card this holiday season to avoid carrying more debt.\n\nIf using your credit card is your only option, it\u2019s important that you use it wisely.\n\nIf you struggle with overspending during the holidays, Alev also recommends setting a budget for each of your credit cards.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay your balance in full every month, it\u2019s important that you understand when you payment is due and have a plan to avoid paying a lot of interest.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to use \u201c buy now, pay later services \u201d, it\u2019s best to be very intentional, Alev said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up. It\u2019s easy to use it a lot and have several different payments that will come down the road,\u201d she said.\n\nAFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVES\n\nThere is more than one way to find the \u201cperfect\u201d gift for your family and it doesn\u2019t always involve spending a lot. In her quest to find gifts that don\u2019t cause her financial stress, Johnson has been getting creative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely been trying to save or just make gifts because I don\u2019t really have the disposable income to buy other people gifts or even buy myself a Christmas gift,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nShe\u2019s been looking into gifting a used book to her dad and because she loves painting and already has all the tools, she\u2019s working on a painting for her mom.\n\nOther affordable alternatives can be sending hand written notes to your loved ones, buying from thrift stores, hosting a cookie bake off or simply spending quality time with your family.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

    "body": "India\u2019s remarkable economic growth has resulted in a notable increase in the country\u2019s high-net-worth investors (HNIs). According to recent wealth reports, the population of high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) with assets worth $1 million or more, which was 7.9 lakh in 2022, will rise to 16.5 lakh, a 107 per cent increase in five years.\n\nThe growing number of HNIs, as well as their desire to diversify their portfolios and access opportunities outside of traditional avenues such as stocks, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, has prompted the innovation of existing investment products, leading to the emergence of a new asset class known as \u2018Alternatives.\u2019\n\nAlthough the same principles of financial and investment planning apply to all investors, HNIs have an advantage. They can choose from a broader range of conventional and unconventional investment opportunities. Investing in unconventional avenues, such as Alternatives, can improve portfolio performance, generate alpha, and allow investors to grow their wealth faster.\n\nLet us look at a few examples of such investment opportunities:\n\n1. Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)\n\nThese funds were launched in 2012 after the market regulator SEBI issued guidelines for their management. The guidelines enable AIFs to identify and make investment opportunities available to investors in the public and private markets. AIFs, for example, can invest in listed and unlisted equities via private equity, infrastructure assets, venture debt, stressed assets, start-ups, and so on.\n\nAs a result, the term \u201calternatives\u201d came about. The guidelines have divided these funds into three categories to make it easier for investors to understand the fund\u2019s investment objective. These categories are I, II, and III.\n\nA noteworthy feature of AIFs is that their returns are generally uncorrelated with publicly traded equity or debt markets, providing a natural hedge against volatility and genuine portfolio diversification.\n\nBecause of the minimum investment threshold of \u20b91 crore, AIFs are only available to HNIs. However, not all funds are required to collect \u20b91 crore in a single transaction. They can collect the money in tranches (called drawdowns) over 2-3 years. The drawdown mechanism makes these funds easy on the wallet. AIFs have amassed an AUM of \u20b98.30-lakh crore in the 11 years since their inception, demonstrating the shift of HNI money to this asset.\n\nThe following are some of the investment opportunities available only to HNIs and presented by AIFs:\n\na) Start-up funds: Angel investors looking to invest in ideas that have the potential to grow into full-scale businesses can do so through start-up funds, which provide a unique platform for bringing promoters and investors together. These funds handpick start-ups after extensive due diligence and build a portfolio with the potential to multiply capital several times.\n\nb) Mid-stage private equity (PE) funds: Investors who are hesitant to take the risk of investing in start-ups can invest in companies in the middle of their evolution cycle. Their business valuations grow exponentially as they mature and enter the late-stage or pre-IPO stage. The mid-stage PE fund allows investors to participate in the growth of such companies.\n\nc) Late-stage or pre-IPO funds: Pre-IPO funds allow investors to invest in mature companies preparing to list on the stock exchange. Such funds build a portfolio of companies about to go public and plan to exit them after their anticipated blockbuster listing, which can magnify returns in a relatively short period. Such funds gained immense popularity after the 2020 stock market rally that witnessed the blockbuster listing of some of the popular IPOs of B2C companies.\n\nd) Hedge funds: These funds invest in both publicly traded and unlisted stocks. They manage their funds using long-only and long-short strategies, with the latter allowed to use complex derivative techniques to hedge the portfolio. The specialty of long-short funds is that they try to optimise returns in every market situation. Hence, they tend to rise and fall lower than their peers. Investors with stock and mutual fund portfolios can diversify with hedge funds to reduce volatility.\n\ne) Performing credit funds: Many operating companies cannot raise funds from banks and NBFCs due to their size or credit ratings. This is where performing credit funds come into play. These funds specialise in credit risk assessment and, after thorough due diligence, offer credit to such companies at relatively higher rates, resulting in higher overall returns than AAA/AA-rated bonds. These funds are attractive for investors seeking higher returns on their fixed-income portfolio, which includes debt funds and AA/AAA-rated bonds.\n\nf) Infrastructure Funds: These funds invest in long-term infrastructure assets owned by PSUs or private companies, such as roads, power transmission lines, and solar power plants. Most infrastructure projects provide essential societal services and thus have intrinsic value. These assets generate cashflows in the form of annuities backed by Central and State governments, lowering the risk of future cash flows significantly. These annuities are regularly distributed by funds to the investors, giving them the characteristic of yield. When the fund reaches maturity, the assets may be sold to another fund or infrastructure trust, resulting in capital gains in overall fund returns.\n\ng) Venture debt funds: Start-up promoters frequently want to raise money without selling equity. As start-ups, they are unable to approach banks and mutual funds. This is where venture debt funds, which specialise in providing credit to start-ups, come in handy. It goes without saying that such AIFs help these start-ups raise funds at high rates. The higher returns of such funds and risk management appeal to risk-taking, yield-hungry investors.\n\nThe above fund list is not exhaustive but highlights some of the unique investment opportunities available to HNIs through AIFs. Many more such options are available to investors, such as special situation funds, real estate yield funds, and so on.\n\nAlong with the investment opportunities presented by AIFs, some other alternatives available to HNIs are:\n\n2. Portfolio Management Services (PMS)\n\nPMS guidelines in India date back to 1993, but this investment avenue has grown in popularity with HNIs recently. The growing financialisation of savings, the formalisation of the economy, and the growing prosperity of tier 2 and 3 cities have resulted in an increase in AUM (excluding EPFO/PF), which stood at \u20b95.28 lakh crore as of July 2023. Because the minimum investment is \u20b950 lakh, this option is also only available to HNIs. Both PMS and mutual funds provide expert guidance in navigating volatile markets and seizing investment opportunities that help create wealth. Because mutual funds cater to retail investors, their guidelines are relatively stringent, and compliance is rigorous.\n\nRegarding PMS, the investment guidelines are somewhat more flexible, allowing portfolio managers to outperform mutual funds. Another feature that appeals to HNIs is that the beneficial ownership of securities is that of the investors, as opposed to mutual funds, where the ownership is that of the fund. Furthermore, PMS is available in two options: discretionary and non-discretionary. In the former case, the portfolio managers make all decisions; in the latter case, the investor makes all decisions.\n\n3. Market-linked Debentures (MLD)\n\nFor HNIs looking to invest a part of their investible surplus in debt, MLDs can be a prudent option. MLDs are non-convertible debt instruments whose returns are tied to a specific financial market benchmark, such as the Nifty 50, the BSE Sensex, or the 10-year G-Sec. The maturity periods of MLDs can vary from one year to five years.\n\nThough the minimum investment for MLDs is \u20b91 lakh, making it easier even for small investors to invest in them, they are more popular with the HNIs owing to the complex structure of these debentures. MLDs, unlike traditional fixed-income securities, do not provide periodic interest payments before maturity. Income multipliers and principal protection are common features of equity-linked MLDs. In the former case, the MLDs can generate a return that is a multiple of the underlying index\u2019s return. This increases the likelihood of a higher overall return for a more minor market movement. The latter option safeguards the principal (up to the face value of the debenture) in the event of an adverse market movement. This feature allows even investors with a moderate risk tolerance to easily participate in the market.\n\nFrom the discussion above, it is amply evident that HNIs have various alternative avenues to grow their wealth. The distinct value proposition of AIF, PMS, and MLDs, with unique features, distinctive risk-return profiles, and low correlation with traditional asset classes, makes them genuinely deserving of a place in the portfolio of every HNI. Before investing, investors should conduct thorough research to understand how these investment options work. It\u2019s important to consider the past track record and management team before making investment decisions. Consultation with investment advisors who are knowledgeable in this area can undoubtedly be beneficial.\n\nThe author is President & Head, Nuvama Wealth"

    "body": "The stock of India\u2019s most valued company, Reliance Industries (RIL), after a decade-long underperformance \u2014 from 2007 to 2017 \u2014 has managed to treble over the last six years.\n\nHowever, when you look at the stock on a three-year basis, RIL with 11 per cent CAGR returns (including the value of demerged Jio Financial Services), has underperformed Nifty 50 which has delivered CAGR returns of a little over 14 per cent in the same time period. This however is nothing to fret about. The stock of RIL has typically tended to underperform whenever the company has been in a heavy investment phase, something that it has embarked on in its green energy ventures.\n\nWith the stock still leaving some money on the table at current levels, long-term investors can accumulate it on dips for four reasons \u2014 one, reasonable valuations; two, being at pole position in India\u2019s high-growth digital and retail business; three, potential for large-scale value creation, similar to its digital and retail forays, in the renewable energy space (not reflected in current valuations); four, stable O2C business.\n\nGrowth engines\n\nThe launch of Jio\u2019s data services in 2016, maturation of the retail business and subsequent stake sales in FY21 were the key catalysts that drove the stock\u2019s outperformance in the last six years. Although there has already been a significant re-rating in valuation the markets have assigned to both businesses, scope for further outperformance from these businesses remains, given the opportunity ahead.\n\nReliance Jio: For one, with Reliance Jio emerging as the largest telecom services company in what is largely a duopolistic market (given survival issues at Vodafone Idea) in India, the growth potential remains strong as 5G will drive advances over the next few years and new 5G enabled use cases will create guzzling growth in data consumption, providing scope for higher ARPUs. Reliance Jio has offerings across the spectrum of wireless, wireline/broadband, enterprise/cloud services and allied retail/enterprise digital offerings that make its services sticky for customers.\n\nIn such a scenario, its dominant position in telecom along with second player Bharti Airtel is likely well entrenched for the foreseeable future in India\u2019s digital ecosystem. These factors position it advantageously to sustain or increase its operating margins in a growing industry.\n\nReliance Retail Ventures: From a modest 1,691 stores in FY14, the retail business has grown to 18,040 stores (and over 66 million square feet of retail space) by FY23. Reliance Retail is the largest player in the country in the organised retail segment, operating brick-and-mortar, e-commerce, cash and carry, B2C, and B2B formats across the retail supply chain. With a low 3 per cent share of the market, there is scope for huge expansion from the combination of market share gains and/in a high-growth market where the consumption theme is picking steam, driven by growth in per capita income.\n\nFor example, in the US, organised retail giant Walmart today has a little over 10 per cent share of the retail industry. While how exactly things will pan out in the Indian retail industry is out in the open, this can provide a perspective on the potential growth for Reliance Retail.\n\nIn recent years, Reliance Retail business has witnessed solid growth with FY21-23 revenue and EBITDA CAGR of 38 and 50 per cent respectively fuelled by a combination of store additions, acquisitions (totalling to $1.2 billion) and its phygital model with acquisitions such as Netmeds, Clovia being digital brands. Besides apparel, grocery and electronics, the company, through acquisitions, has gained foothold in newer segments such as pharmacy (Netmeds), fashion (Zivame, Clovia) and D2C (Urban ladder), which will drive growth in the medium term.\n\nWith dominance in digital and retail ecosystem and scope to enhance synergies across these, Reliance is strategically positioned to garner a good share of the consumer spending which will happen over the next decades with its consumer facing businesses.\n\nO2C & E&P\n\nRIL\u2019s traditional businesses \u2014 O2C and exploration (E&P) \u2014 still account for 45-50 per cent of RIL\u2019s consolidated EBITDA.\n\nSpanning expansive refining and petrochemicals business, the O2C business performance can be volatile depending on trends in crude oil prices and refining margins. In times of high crude oil prices, higher refining and petchem margins have helped the overall profitability. Similarly, there have been times when, due to falling crude prices, refining and petchem cracker have been on a falling spree, thereby adding to the pressure on the overall profit performance. Reliance\u2019s O2C business has best-in-class margins and may not be comparable to Indian refiners, given the scale of operations, efficiencies and export focus.\n\nOverall, while it remains a significant part of the company\u2019s business, it will not get the same high valuation like RIL\u2019s consumer facing businesses. In fact, based on value assigned to this segment by analysts, its overall contribution to RIL\u2019s valuation has not changed much from around the $75 billion it was estimated to be valued at when stake sale talks with Saudi Aramco were ongoing in 2019. Scope for increase in value in the medium term can arise from the company\u2019s expansion in the petrochemicals business.\n\nThe E&P business is small relative to overall size of Reliance. Analyst estimates for its value accounts for less than 10 per cent of overall RIL value.\n\nNext big thing\n\nHistorically any business that RIL has put its weight behind has ended up being one of the largest players in the field and also managed to create a lot of shareholder wealth.\n\nOn these lines, RIL has identified green energy as its next growth opportunity. As the world moves away from conventional fossil-based energy sources, towards cleaner and sustainable energy sources, the company is looking to capitalise on the huge demand potential for renewable power anticipated over the next few decades.\n\nThe company has committed a whopping \u20b975,000 crore investment into building a comprehensive green energy and green material ecosystem. At Jamnagar, it is building a green energy complex spread over 5,000 acres of land which, according to the company, will be among the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities globally. This will cost it \u20b960,000 crore, while the balance \u20b915,000 crore is being invested in partnerships, building future technologies, value chain to be able to build an integrated renewable energy ecosystem. The company has already made several investments in companies that are working on green energy technologies \u2014 such as battery technologies, solar cells/panels, clean mobility solutions, software tools for solar energy, etc.\n\nWhile it\u2019s up in the air as to whether green energy investments will reap same dividends as RIL\u2019s telecom and retail forays, the good thing for investors is that market is hardly assigning any value to this business at current levels. Hence, there is scope for significant upside down the years from this business if the company repeats the success it has had in its other businesses.\n\nValuation\n\nReliance Industries currently trades at 24 times its trailing twelve-month earnings. While this is above RIL\u2019s pre-Covid three-year average valuation of around 20 times, given growth delivered by telecom and retail businesses post Covid, there is scope for further re-rating.\n\nSOTP: Reliance Retail Ventures, which is the flagship company, is currently valued at about $100 billion (\u20b98.3 lakh crore), based on recent transactions. RIL has an 83 per cent stake in it.\n\nReliance Jio, which is the other important segment of Reliance\u2019s business, was valued at $63 billion back in 2020. Market assigned value is $80\u201390 billion range - 10 to 11x one-year forward EBITDA, which is not expensive. RIL has 67 per cent stake in it.\n\nAdding the value of RIL\u2019s stake in the above businesses and around $75 billion (conservative and assumes no change in value in last 5 years) for its O2C business, the enterprise value for Reliance works out to around $214 billion. This excludes value of its E&P business and its media businesses and some value in its monetisable real estate. This also assigns zero value for its green energy business. RIL has net debt of around $15 billion. Adjusted for debt, its valuation is around $200 billion, which matches its current market cap. Adding value of E&P, and high potential for large-scale value creation from green energy business, there is some money left on the table for long-term investors who can accumulate the stock on dips.\n\nAt a time when small and mid-cap stock valuations are trading at dizzying valuations, large caps like RIL may be safer bets for the long term.\n\nWhy Growth engines intact Valuation reasonable Potential value of green energy business not reflected"

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA bride-to-be has been defended after choosing her mother to walk her down the aisle instead of her stepfather.\n\nIn a recent post shared to the popular \u201cAm I The A**hole?\u201d Reddit forum, the mother \u2013 who goes by the username u/PopShort7064 \u2013 asked if she was in the wrong for agreeing to walk her child down the aisle, in addition to doing a mother/daughter dance at the wedding. She specified that she also has a husband, who\u2019s been a stepfather to her daughter since she was 10.\n\nThe parent went on to give more context about her family, noting that she lost the father of her children - Calla and Hawthorn - when they were six and eight. She then shared that she remarried four years later, before opening up about her relationship with her second husband and how her children reacted to it.\n\n\u201cWe were friends for several months, dated some, stronger feelings developed and I introduced him to the kids to see how they would get along,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe halted for a year while my kids and I did some therapy because their reaction to my husband was strongly negative, because they didn\u2019t want to replace their dad. But once therapy was ongoing, they were doing better. From there, things move faster but the kids were on board for things to move on.\u201d\n\nThe mother specified that it was clear to her children that her husband \u201cwas not going to be filling the role of a dad in their lives\u201d. She added that her partner \u201cwas fine with that, as long as he was respected and they could work toward being a caring family\u201d.\n\nShe continued to note that while she had a close relationship with Calla, it was \u201cextremely tough\u201d for her child to lose her father. She specified that while her child has a good relationship with her stepfather, \u201cit comes nowhere close to the bond she had with her dad\u201d. She also shared that she continued to get close to her daughter after she turned 12, before recalling a point in Calla\u2019s childhood when she asked her mother to walk her down the aisle.\n\n\u201cShe was 15 when she told me if she ever got married she would want me to walk her down the aisle and for us to do a mother/daughter dance instead of a father/daughter one,\u201d the parent wrote. \u201cI told her we could dance to the song her dad used to sing to her. She said she loved the idea.\u201d\n\nThe Reddit user expressed that she \u201calways assumed things would change\u201d down the line, with her daughter either choosing to walk alone or with her brother, \u201cas a representation of her dad\u201d. However, she shared that when her daughter got engaged, she \u201casked [her mother] right away\u201d to walk her down the aisle.\n\n\u201cShe brought up our past conversation and told me she wanted exactly that. I told her I would be honoured,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe cried tears of joy together. I told her that her dad would be so proud.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the Reddit user, her husband didn\u2019t take the news as expected. She explained that he asked her a series of questions, with the first one being if she asked Calla if both her mother and stepfather could walk her down the aisle. The woman noted that she didn\u2019t ask her daughter that.\n\n\u201cThen he asked if she ever considered asking him, and I said I could not answer that for her. He asked me if I thought of him when I said yes,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe asked whether I gave any thought to all he has done for Calla, for both kids, and the fact he\u2019s still not looked upon as a fatherly figure all these years later. I told him I did not think of him when asked because I was overjoyed. He told me I should have given him a lot more consideration and I should have tried to compromise with my daughter.\u201d\n\nShe claimed that three weeks after the incident, her husband hasn\u2019t changed his stance and he still feels like his wife \u201cwas wrong\u201d. She also said that he told her he \u201cfelt he deserved more from all\u201d of the family, and that his wife should be \u201cmaking sure he is respected and honoured for his contribution to the kids\u2019 lives\u201d.\n\nThe Reddit post has quickly gone viral, as it has received more than 6,500 upvotes. In the comments, many people have gone on to defend the bride\u2019s mother, noting that her husband should respect Calla\u2019s decisions for her wedding day. They also criticised the stepfather and claimed he should be more considerate of Calla\u2019s bond with her late father.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that no man, as you know, could ever hold a candle to my father so I feel comfortable saying that your daughter would probably never ask him [because] it would be like disrespecting the memory of her father,\u201d one wrote. \u201cAnd if your husband is close enough to your daughter, he could just ask her himself. It probably isn\u2019t as personal for her as it is for him, especially if you and your husband did not have any more children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about him and all he\u2019s done. It\u2019s about Calla,\u201d another added. \u201cShe lost her dad and, while the grief fades a bit over the years, big events bring it roaring back in (at least that\u2019s been my experience). Her wedding is going to be bittersweet. She needs her parent (the one she\u2019s always had and the one who loved her dad) to \u2018give her away.\u2019\u201d\n\nA third wrote: \u201cThe real question here is why does your husband believe he\u2019s more entitled to this honour of walking your daughter down the aisle, and \u2018giving\u2019 her away than YOU? You, who is her mother, who has been there through it all, who has comforted and given her a home and place to be herself, unconditionally?\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted u/PopShort7064 for comment."

    "body": "We\u2019re coming up for air from our coverage of The Game Awards to loop our readers in on some of the best deals happening this weekend. If you\u2019re looking to experience some of the winners from the 2023 Game Awards for yourself, you can find discounts on a variety of titles on Steam. Some other highlights you might want to check out include a sitewide sale on Blu-Rays from The Criterion Collection, and the Xbox Series X matching its Black Friday price on Walmart and Amazon.\n\nAs we do every weekend here at Polygon, we\u2019ve rounded up a collection of our favorite deals from the worlds of gaming and entertainment, along with some of the best-selling products that have made a recent appearance on our site.\n\nThe best gaming deals this week\n\nSteam is discounting many contenders from the 2023 Game Awards and winners from the past nine years. This is a fantastic opportunity to supplement your library with some of the biggest releases of 2023, like Diablo 4 and Starfield, but you can also find discounts on essential titles that you may have missed, like Valiant Hearts, Her Story, or Celeste. Below, we\u2019ve highlighted some of the winners from the 2023 Game Awards, but we also featured a larger list of winners from previous years.\n\nCocoon is the latest title from a studio founded by Jeppe Carlsen, the person responsible for the unsettling narrative platformers Limbo and Inside. This psychedelic odyssey is a personal favorite amongst much of the Polygon staff and won Best Indie Game during the 2023 Game Awards.\n\nThe hyper-stylized, rhythm-based action game Hi-Fi Rush was nominated for a number of categories in the 2023 Game Awards and ultimately took home the prize for audio design, and with good reason. Hi-Fi Rush is a witty and wild game that features an excellent original soundtrack in addition to licensed songs from Nine Inch Nails, The Flaming Lips, and The Prodigy (just to name a few).\n\nWe\u2019ve said it before, but once again, I\u2019m kindly asking that nobody pay more than $350 for an Xbox Series X during the holidays. If you missed out on the chance to pick up the Diablo 4 Xbox Series X bundle for $349.99, Walmart and Amazon are currently offering the Xbox Series X as a standalone purchase for the same price, which is still a $150 discount off the standard price of the Microsoft console.\n\nRelated The best accessories for your Xbox Series X\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a bummer that this Xbox Series X deal lacks a pre-packaged game, but there are still plenty of sales floating around to add some excellent titles to your Xbox library without paying full price. For instance, Amazon is offering some modest discounts on $50 Xbox Gift Cards, allowing you to pick up as many as you\u2019d like for $45 each. Target has also discounted three-month Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions to $44.99 (was $49.99), which allows you access a rotating library of excellent titles for the Xbox Series X like Hi-Fi Rush, Cocoon, Venba, Starfield, and more.\n\nThe 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox Series X is still available at Woot for $74.99, the best price yet for the $119.99 controller. This massive gamepad is a must for fighting game fans, so whether you\u2019ve recently picked up Street Fighter 6 or Mortal Kombat 1, or you\u2019re looking forward to the launch of Tekken 8 in February, now is the perfect time to pick up your new weapon of choice.\n\n8BitDo arcade stick for Xbox $75\n\n$120\n\n38% off Prices taken at time of publishing. Fighting sticks can be really pricey. Thankfully, this fighting stick for the Xbox and PC is a great yet affordable option for getting into fighting games. $75 at Woot\n\nThe top-selling stuff on Polygon this week\n\nThe best entertainment deals this week\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of The Legend of Vox Machina series on Prime Video, you can pick up a two-disc Limited Edition vinyl LP of the soundtrack for just $37.56 on Amazon, its lowest price to date. The soundtrack is packaged in a full-color gatefold sleeve and even contains exclusive tracks not featured in the series.\n\nWe recommend a lot of vinyl during our weekend posts, so it seems fitting that we should point you toward a solid record player. The Victrola Revolution Go record player is one of the more unique suggestions from our 2023 Holiday Gift Guide and is currently on sale for around $125 in a variety of striking colors. Normally $199.99, this portable record player is equipped with a convenient carrying strap, built-in speaker, and an on-board battery that can keep it running for up to 12 hours on a single charge.\n\nThe massive 6,187-piece Lego version of Din Djarin\u2019s iconic ride from The Mandalorian is currently matching its Black Friday price on Amazon and is on sale for $419.99 (was $599.99). This is an ideal gift for any fan of the show, and is brimming with detail like a full-size cargo compartment complete with carbonite prisoner storage. In addition to minifigs of Mando and Grogu, you\u2019ll also find a Lego version of Kuiil riding on his Blurrg (yes, that\u2019s actually what its called).\n\nThrough Dec. 22, The Criterion Collection is offering some impressive discounts on some excellent selections from its catalog of 4K UHD Blu-Rays and box sets (including pre-orders). Many of the titles included in The Criterion Collection feature bespoke box art, making them excellent additions to any collection of physical media.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up some of our favorite highlights to check out below, like Trainspotting, Time Bandits, The Godzilla Showa-Era Box Set, and Moonage Daydream. But if you\u2019d like to see what else is on offer, you can head over to The Criterion Collection deals page to see the dozens of other titles you can add to your library."

fasting could lead to a reduced risk of cognitive deterioration, a recent study published in the journal Cell Metabolism suggests.\n\nResearchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine adjusted the feeding schedule of certain groups of mice so that they only ate within six-hour windows each day.\n\nALZHEIMER\u2019S BLOOD TEST COULD HIT THE MARKET IN EARLY 2024, RESEARCHERS SAY\n\n(This would be equivalent to 14 hours of fasting for humans, the researchers noted.)\n\nCompared to a control group of mice that ate on demand, the fasting mice showed improvements in memory, were less hyperactive in the evenings and had fewer sleep disruptions .\n\nThey also were shown to have less buildup of amyloid proteins in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe goal of the restricted eating is to restore the circadian rhythm, the researchers said, which could help counteract the numerous disruptions that Alzheimer\u2019s patients face when it comes to sleep and schedule-related confusion.\n\nHIDDEN BELLY FAT COULD SIGNAL ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE RISK 15 YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS SHOW UP, STUDY FINDS\n\n\"Our study emphasizes the power of feeding timing in aligning the circadian clock and its impact on the brain,\" said senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We were hopeful to see some improvements in pathology, but did not expect such profound effects in reducing plaques and inflammation and improving memory,\" she went on.\n\n\"The effects of time-restricted feeding on lower amyloid pathology were also measurable in blood using markers found in the clinic, which was another important finding.\"\n\nThe researchers hope that these findings will lead to human trials.\n\nThe goal is to obtain funding to start a pilot study of patients next year.\n\n\"Accessible interventions like this have great translational potential, as they are available and are usually very well-tolerated,\" Desplats said.\n\nThe goal is to obtain funding to start a pilot study of patients next year.\n\n\"This may have special importance for the elderly , as time-restricted eating does not require limitation in calories or change in the diet, but may offer important benefits ranging from metabolic and sleep regulation to potential cognitive improvement.\"\n\nTIME-RESTRICTED EATING NO MORE BENEFICIAL THAN CALORIC RESTRICTION IN OBESE PATIENTS, STUDY SAYS\n\nAdopting a new dietary pattern should not be a replacement for medical care , however, as Desplats emphasized the importance of patients' discussions about options with their clinicians.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it uses animal models that only represent certain aspects of disease and \"do not present comorbidities or other clinical diseases associated with aging, which are very common in Alzheimer\u2019s patients,\" noted Desplats.\n\n\"Furthermore, the study was done under strictly controlled conditions that did not resemble the variety of people\u2019s habits and environments,\" she added.\n\nTHE 8 BIGGEST ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE MYTHS \u2014 AND THE TRUTHS BEHIND THEM\n\nThe researchers hope that the public recognizes the importance of the circadian clock in regulating many aspects of health .\n\n\"Sustaining healthy sleep and eating habits that are more synchronized with the natural environment are vital in a society that is constantly exposed to food, light and shift work,\" said Desplats.\n\nPrevious studies have supported this association between fasting and reduced Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\nLast year, a study led by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology in Los Angeles also found that mice that followed a fasting diet showed lower levels of \"plaques and tangles\" in the brain, reduced brain inflammation and better performance on cognitive tests.\n\n\"Cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) had strong effects against Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in two different types of Alzheimer\u2019s mouse models,\" the lead author of that study, USC biogerontologist Dr. Valter Longo, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Fasting decreases pro-aging factors that are secreted after we eat, which can slow down the aging of the brain.\"\n\n\"In mice, the effects of FMD cycles were very strong and wide, meaning they affected both learning and memory and also Alzheimer\u2019s pathology peptides/proteins (amyloid and tau).\"\n\nBased on these findings, Longo recommends that people talk to their neurologist about considering fasting-mimicking diets and other nutrition-based approaches in support of standard-of-care drugs and therapies.\n\n\"Especially for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for which pharmacological interventions have had very limited efficacy, it will be very important to continue to study fasting-mimicking diets and other dietary interventions that can make drugs more effective,\" he added.\n\nDesplats, lead author of the UC San Diego study, told Fox News Digital that Longo\u2019s studies are on a similar track, demonstrating the connection between metabolism, fasting and brain health.\n\n\"The main difference is that we tested an approach that does not require calorie reduction, which may be more sustainable and safer for older people whose metabolisms are already impacted by aging changes,\" she said.\n\nCOLORADO WOMAN WITH ALZHEIMER\u2019S IS STILL VIBRANT AFTER MORE THAN 4 YEARS: \u2018I REFUSE TO SURRENDER\u2019\n\nDr. Joseph Antoun, CEO and chairman of the nutritech company L-Nutra in California, was also involved in the USC study.\n\n\"In these studies, mice fed the fasting-mimicking diet showed improved cognitive performance, motor learning and both short- and long-term memory, and promoted the growth of new neurons in the brain,\" he told Fox News Digital via email.\n\n\"Fasting-mimicking diets have the potential to drastically reduce many aging and disease risk factors by reducing neuroinflammation or superoxide production in the brain.\"\n\nFasting can help the brain function in a myriad of ways, said Antoun.\n\n\"Fasting decreases pro-aging factors that are secreted after we eat, which can slow down the aging of the brain,\" he told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement.\n\nTime-restricted eating can also improve the quality of sleep, he noted, which can help the brain recover better.\n\nBecause fasting-mimicking diets can be done in longer periods, they can help the body go into higher levels of ketosis, Antoun noted, \"which is wonderful for the brain.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n(Ketosis, which is when the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose, has been shown to have cognitive benefits.)\n\n\"Prolonged fasting can also help with leaky gut, which then can aid the brain,\" added Antoun.\n\nIn addition, intermittent fasting can help to control blood sugar , which can slow down the progression of Alzheimer's, the doctor said.\n\nOver the past several decades, there has been a steady increase in diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, Antoun noted.\n\n\"However, when we are able to detect neurodegenerative conditions early, we can take positive steps that may slow the process and mitigate any major side effects of the disorder,\" he said.\n\nDuring prolonged periods of fasting, cells undergo a process called autophagy, which involves removing and recycling damaged cellular components, Antoun said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This process is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and can help protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s,\" he explained.\n\nMore than six million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's, and every 67 seconds, someone in America develops the disease, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association."

Everyone has their own \u201chacks\u201d when it comes to falling asleep in 2023; the days of counting sheep are long gone. Jennifer Aniston\u2019s top tip for battling insomnia is to \u201csleep with my phone at least five feet away from me\u201d, while Martha Stewart recommends focusing on your breathing. In her 1973 feminist novel Fear of Flying, author Erica Jong notes that, sometimes, the only way to overcome sleeplessness is by pretending you don\u2019t care about nodding off. \u201cThen sleep became piqued, like a rejected lover, and crept up to try to seduce you.\u201d\n\nIn a world where human sleep patterns have increasingly been plunged into chaos, people are having to turn to ever more creative \u2013 and often bizarre \u2013 means of getting their 40 winks in. Today, the internet is littered with tips and tricks that promise a sound sleep, but not all of them are effective and none are foolproof. (Kiwis, by the way, contain serotonin and antioxidants, which is why it\u2019s thought they might have sleep-promoting benefits.) The result is a society with a growing problem on its hands: persistent sleeplessness \u2013 otherwise known as insomnia.\n\nGlobally, it is estimated that around 10 per cent of adults meet the criteria for insomnia; the sleep disorder is characterised either by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep to such an extent that it disturbs your ability to function during the day.\n\nInsomnia lies at the heart of the new Apple TV+ comedy series Still Up. The show follows Lisa (Antonia Thomas) and Danny (Craig Roberts), two best friends who stay up late talking to each other because they can\u2019t sleep. Lit by the blue glow emanating from their electronic devices, Lisa and Danny form a deep connection over their nocturnal calls, with their friendship gradually drifting into something more. At one point, Lisa checks herself into a sleep clinic in London, telling Danny she\u2019s willing to \u201ctry anything\u201d at this point \u2013 a sentiment the sleepless know all too well.\n\nThe series was inspired by creator Natalie Walter\u2019s own experience with insomnia, and her late-night Facebook chats with Steve Burge, her co-writer on Still Up. \u201cAs part of the research for [the show] we visited a sleep clinic, which was fascinating,\u201d she tells me. \u201cSome evolutionary biologists think the reason humans have different sleep patterns is that during our early history, a few members of the tribe would always be awake and vigilant during the night, and so could protect everyone else from predators. Not that I\u2019d be much use fighting off a woolly mammoth.\u201d\n\nJust like depression or anxiety, insomnia can often be triggered by something. Whether it\u2019s a life event as monumental as becoming a new parent, or something as commonplace as jet lag, there are any number of things that can prompt a bout of sleeplessness. The issue, explains sleep therapist Dr Lindsay Browning, is that insomnia can often remain long after the trigger has gone. \u201cAt this point, you\u2019re no longer worried about the traumatic incident; you\u2019re now worried about not being able to sleep.\u201d It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSocial media consultant and mother of two, Amy Fieldhouse-Downes, started suffering from insomnia after the birth of her second son in 2019. She believes the affliction was rooted in anxiety. \u201cIf you Google how to go to sleep, I\u2019ve probably tried everything on there,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to bed earlier, going to bed later, meditations that would get cut off by an advert, lavender products, sleep cream, eye masks, Sominex sleep tablets. And I even used it as an excuse to have a few glasses of wine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she tried sleeping with specialised earplugs that she was finally able to get some rest.\n\nLong-time insomniac and video producer Preshita says she has tried many tricks over the years \u2013 \u201cfrom drinking chamomile tea to counting backwards from 1,000\u201d. After much experimenting, she has found that taking a shower before bed and keeping her bedroom clutter-free were the most effective methods. \u201cSomeone recommended masturbating, and that was another thing that worked,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u2018Still Up\u2019 follows Lisa (Antonia Thomas) and Danny (Craig Roberts) as best friends who stay up late talking to each other because they can\u2019t sleep (Courtesy of Apple)\n\nMillions of people struggle with insomnia in the UK alone. Studies have found that women are 40 per cent more likely to be affected by insomnia than men. \u201cThis sex difference in insomnia emerges after puberty, suggesting that hormonal differences such as menstruation, pregnancy and menopause may be the cause of this increased risk in women,\u201d Dr Browning says. The symptoms of insomnia can last a long time; a longitudinal study conducted in the UK found that 69 per cent of respondents affected by the sleep disorder at the start of the study still had insomnia 12 months later.\n\nThis may go to show how complex treating insomnia can be. Explaining the appeal of quick fixes, Dr Browning says, \u201cIn the short term you\u2019re changing something, so [they] can often [work] like a placebo. If hunger is keeping you awake, eating before bed will help. If your mattress is uncomfortable, sleeping on the floor will help.\u201d But the problem isn\u2019t just that these methods don\u2019t necessarily work \u2013 it\u2019s that they could be used to exploit vulnerable insomniacs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a sleep therapist, my doctorate is in insomnia and it\u2019s very, very frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who have insomnia are desperate. I treat patients who are suicidal, who have quit their jobs, whose lives are completely on hold because of their sleeping issues. And they\u2019re vulnerable. My clients have spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds on things that made no difference. If people are being mis-sold expensive things and they\u2019re being preyed upon, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d\n\nRosie Davies-Smith, a PR consultant, says she has spent more than \u00a3600 on a variety of treatments, including a combination of doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter medications, teas, supplements, weighted blankets, and eye masks. \u201cWhile supplements, exercise, and sleep hygiene provided some relief, the true breakthrough came from addressing the root causes of my insomnia through therapy,\u201d she tells me.\n\nRosie Davies-Smith, a PR consultant, says she has spent more than \u00a3600 on a variety of treatments, including a combination of doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter medications (Getty Images)\n\nAs with many other mental health disorders, therapy can often provide long-term relief from insomnia. The most effective of these therapies is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),\u201d says Dr Browning, describing it as a \u201ccomplete cure\u201d that a lot of people don\u2019t know about. \u201cDifferent from CBT for depression or CBT for anxiety, CBTI works by addressing the negative thoughts and worries that perpetuate insomnia.\u201d\n\nOther avenues of treatment are also proving increasingly fruitful. A new drug called Quviviq was just approved by the NHS last week. Dr Browning is optimistic about the \u201cexciting\u201d new medication, explaining that it acts in a very different way to other sleeping pills, which \u201cknock you out\u201d but cause people to develop a tolerance. \u201cAs much as CBTI is the gold standard across the world, there might be some people who need a bit of [medicinal] help as well, a bit like depression.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Dr Browning says there\u2019s no harm in trying the occasional Reddit recommendation \u2013 if it\u2019s free. That might be an act of self-pleasure, narrating the plot of Pride and Prejudice in your head, or listening to shipping forecasts. FaceTiming your best friend into the early hours of the morning \u2013 like Lisa and Danny do in Still Up \u2013 probably isn\u2019t encouraged, but it does make for a very good romcom.\n\n\u2018Still Up\u2019 is available for streaming on Apple TV+."

    "body": "Travis Kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately, and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the Taylor Swift bandwagon. The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many -- Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this \"Love Story\" just some extravagant publicity stunt?\n\nTime will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: \"You need to calm down.\" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not.\n\nOne of the most hyped \"Sunday Night Football\" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift \u2014 make sure your phone is charged.\n\nTo Travis and Taylor, \"Welcome to New York.\" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline.\n\nFor bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called \"Prop Stars\" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time.\n\nMORE: Jets vs. Chiefs betting preview\n\nFanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4\n\nTop of the Charts: Travis Kelce to have the Most Receiving Yards in the Game (+140)\n\nThe Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nSeeing Red: Chiefs to Win by 22+ (+380)\n\nIf this bet ends up cashing, the \"Seeing Red\" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nOpening Act: Travis Kelce First TD Scorer (+400)\n\nOut of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into \"Checkdown Charlie\" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first.\n\nOur pick: Bet on it\n\nFriENDZONE: Travis Kelce to NOT score a TD (+120)\n\nObviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nRunning Away Together: Chiefs to have 150+ Total Rushing Yards (+420)\n\nThe strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nSeemingly Ranch: Travis Kelce Last TD Scorer (+550)\n\nRanch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nPlot Twist: Zach Wilson to have 300+ Passing Yards (+1800)\n\nIf you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. \"I'm the problem, it's me,\" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nPlatinum Performance: Travis Kelce to Score 3+ TDs (+2500)\n\nWhen it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what\u2019s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly.\n\nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)\n\nExes & 0s: NY Jets to Score 0 Total Points (+3400)\n\nThe Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn\u2019t have a quarterback. Don\u2019t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you\u2019re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game.\n\nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)"

    "body": "Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) once again played host to Silicon Valley\u2019s AI leaders on Tuesday as the US Senate reconvened its AI Insights Forum for a second time. On the guest list this go around: manifesto enthusiast Marc Andreessen and venture capitalist John Doerr, as well as Max Tegmark of the Future of Life Institute and NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson. On the agenda: \u201cthe transformational innovation that pushes the boundaries of medicine, energy, and science, and the sustainable innovation necessary to drive advancements in security, accountability, and transparency in AI,\u201d according to a release from Sen. Schumer\u2019s office.\n\nUpon exiting the meeting Tuesday, Schumer told the assembled press, \"it is clear that American leadership on AI can\u2019t be done on the cheap. Almost all of the experts in today\u2019s Forum called for robust, sustained federal investment in private and public sectors to achieve our goals of American-led transformative and sustainable innovation in AI.\n\nPer National Security AI Commission estimates, paying for that could cost around $32 billion a year. However, Schumer believes that those funding challenges can be addressed by \"leveraging the private sector by employing new and innovative funding mechanisms \u2013 like the Grand Challenges prize idea.\"\n\n\"We must prioritize transformational innovation, to help create new vistas, unlock new cures, improve education, reinforce national security, protect the global food supply, and more,\" Schumer remarked. But in doing so, we must act sustainably in order to minimize harms to workers, civil society and the environment. \"We need to strike a balance between transformational and sustainable innovation,\" Schumer said. \"Finding this balance will be key to our success.\"\n\nSenators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Kennedy (R-LA) also got in on the proposed regulatory action Tuesday, introducing legislation that would provide more transparency on AI-generated content by requiring clear labeling and disclosures. Such technology could resemble the Content Credentials tag that the C2PA and CAI industry advocacy groups are developing.\n\n\"Our bill is simple,\" Senator Schatz said in a press statement. \"If any content is made by artificial intelligence, it should be labeled so that people are aware and aren\u2019t fooled or scammed.\u201d\n\nThe Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act, as they're calling it, would require generative AI system developers to clearly and conspicuously disclose AI-generated content to users. Those developers, and their licensees, would also have to take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent \"systematic publication of content without disclosures.\" The bill would also establish a working group to create non-binding technical standards to help social media platforms automatically identify such content as well.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIt puts the onus where it belongs: on the companies and not the consumers,\u201d Schatz said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \u201cLabels will help people to be informed. They will also help companies using AI to build trust in their content.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s meeting follows the recent introduction of new AI legislation, dubbed the Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act of 2023 (S. 3050). Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Todd Young (R-IN) all co-sponsored the bill. The bill proposes AI bug bounty programs and would require a vulnerability analysis study for AI-enabled military applications. It\u2019s passage into law would also launch a report into AI regulation in the financial services industry (which the head of the SEC had recently been lamenting) as well as a second report on data sharing and coordination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frankly a hard challenge,\u201d SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told The Financial Times recently, speaking on the challenges the financial industry faces in AI adoption and regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard financial stability issue to address because most of our regulation is about individual institutions, individual banks, individual money market funds, individual brokers; it\u2019s just in the nature of what we do.\u201d\n\n\"Working people are fighting back against artificial intelligence and other technology used to eliminate workers or undermine and exploit us,\" AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said at the conclusion of Tuesday's forum. \"If we fail to involve workers and unions across the entire innovation process, AI will curtail our rights, threaten good jobs and undermine our democracy. But the responsible adoption of AI, properly regulated, has the potential to create opportunity, improve working conditions and build prosperity.\"\n\nThe forums are part of Senator Schumer\u2019s SAFE Innovation Framework, which his office debuted in June. \u201cThe US must lead in innovation and write the rules of the road on AI and not let adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party craft the standards for a technology set to become as transformative as electricity,\u201d the program announcement reads.\n\nWhile Andreesen calls for AI advancement at any cost and Tegmark continues to advocate for a developmental \u201ctime out,\u201d rank and file AI industry workers are also fighting to make their voices heard ahead of the forum. On Monday, a group of employees from two dozen leading AI firms published an open letter to Senator Schumer, demanding Congress take action to safeguard their livelihoods from the \u201cdystopian future\u201d that Andreessen\u2019s screed, for example, would require.\n\n\u201cEstablishing robust protections related to workplace technology and rebalancing power between workers and employers could reorient the economy and tech innovation toward more equitable and sustainable outcomes,\u201d the letter authors argue.\n\nSenator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) had, the previous month, called on leading AI companies to \u201canswer for the working conditions of their data workers, laborers who are often paid low wages and provided no benefits but keep AI products online.\u201d\n\n\"We covered a lot of good ground today, and I think we\u2019ll all be walking out of the room with a deeper understanding of how to approach American-led AI innovation,\" Schumer said Tueseay. \"We\u2019ll continue this conversation in weeks and months to come \u2013 in more forums like this and committee hearings in Congress \u2013 as we work to develop comprehensive, bipartisan AI legislation.\""

    "body": "The Biden Administration unveiled its ambitious next steps in addressing and regulating artificial intelligence development on Monday. Its expansive new executive order (EO) seeks to establish further protections for the public as well as improve best practices for federal agencies and their contractors.\n\n\"The President several months ago directed his team to pull every lever,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a recent press call. \"That's what this order does, bringing the power of the federal government to bear in a wide range of areas to manage AI's risk and harness its benefits ... It stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around the world and like all executive orders, this one has the force of law.\"\n\nThese actions will be introduced over the next year with smaller safety and security changes happening in around 90 days and with more involved reporting and data transparency schemes requiring nine to 12 months to fully deploy. The administration is also creating an \u201cAI council,\u201d chaired by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, who will meet with federal agency heads to ensure that the actions are being executed on schedule.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPublic safety\n\n\"In response to the President's leadership on the subject, 15 major American technology companies have begun their voluntary commitments to ensure that AI technology is safe, secure and trustworthy before releasing it to the public,\" the senior administration official said. \"That is not enough.\"\n\nThe EO directs the establishment of new standards for AI safety and security, including reporting requirements for developers whose foundation models might impact national or economic security. Those requirements will also apply in developing AI tools to autonomously implement security fixes on critical software infrastructure.\n\nBy leveraging the Defense Production Act, this EO will \"require that companies developing any foundation model that poses a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety must notify the federal government when training the model, and must share the results of all red-team safety tests,\" per a White House press release. That information must be shared prior to the model being made available to to the public, which could help reduce the rate at which companies unleash half-baked and potentially deadly machine learning products.\n\nIn addition to the sharing of red team test results, the EO also requires disclosure of the system\u2019s training runs (essentially, its iterative development history). \u201cWhat that does is that creates a space prior to the release\u2026 to verify that the system is safe and secure,\u201d officials said.\n\nAdministration officials were quick to point out that this reporting requirement will not impact any AI models currently available on the market, nor will it impact independent or small- to medium-size AI companies moving forward, as the threshold for enforcement is quite high. It's geared specifically for the next generation of AI systems that the likes of Google, Meta and OpenAI are already working on with enforcement on models starting at 10^26 petaflops, a capacity currently beyond the limits of existing AI models. \"This is not going to catch AI systems trained by graduate students, or even professors,\u201d the administration official said.\n\nWhat's more, the EO will encourage the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security to address AI threats \"to critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks,\" per the release. \"Agencies that fund life-science projects will establish these standards as a condition of federal funding, creating powerful incentives to ensure appropriate screening and manage risks potentially made worse by AI.\" In short, any developers found in violation of the EO can likely expect a prompt and unpleasant visit from the DoE, FDA, EPA or other applicable regulatory agency, regardless of their AI model\u2019s age or processing speed.\n\nIn an effort to proactively address the decrepit state of America's digital infrastructure, the order also seeks to establish a cybersecurity program, based loosely on the administration's existing AI Cyber Challenge, to develop AI tools that can autonomously root out and shore up security vulnerabilities in critical software infrastructure. It remains to be seen whether those systems will be able to address the concerns of misbehaving models that SEC head Gary Gensler recently raised.\n\nAI watermarking and cryptographic validation\n\nWe're already seeing the normalization of deepfake trickery and AI-empowered disinformation on the campaign trail. So, the White House is taking steps to ensure that the public can trust the text, audio and video content that it publishes on its official channels. The public must be able to easily validate whether the content they see is AI-generated or not, argued White House officials on the press call.\n\nAdobe\n\nThe Department of Commerce is in charge of the latter effort and is expected to work closely with existing industry advocacy groups like the C2PA and its sister organization, the CAI, to develop and implement a watermarking system for federal agencies. \u201cWe aim to support and facilitate and help standardize that work [by the C2PA],\u201d administration officials said. \u201cWe see ourselves as plugging into that ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOfficials further explained that the government is supporting the underlying technical standards and practices that will lead to digital watermarking\u2019 wider adoption \u2014 similar to the work it did around developing the HTTPS ecosystem and in getting both developers and the public on-board with it. This will help federal officials achieve their other goal of ensuring that the government's official messaging can be relied upon.\n\nCivil rights and consumer protections\n\nThe first Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that the White House released last October directed agencies to \u201ccombat algorithmic discrimination while enforcing existing authorities to protect people's rights and safety,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cBut there's more to do.\u201d\n\nThe new EO will require guidance be extended to \u201clandlords, federal benefits programs and federal contractors\u201d to prevent AI systems from exacerbating discrimination within their spheres of influence. It will also direct the Department of Justice to develop best practices for investigating and prosecuting civil rights violations related to AI, as well as, according to the announcement, \u201cthe use of AI in sentencing, parole and probation, pretrial release and detention, risk assessments, surveillance, crime forecasting and predictive policing, and forensic analysis.\"\n\nAdditionally, the EO calls for prioritizing federal support to accelerate development of privacy-preserving techniques that would enable future large language models to be trained on large datasets without the current risk of leaking personal details that those datasets might contain. These solutions could include \u201ccryptographic tools that preserve individuals\u2019 privacy,\u201d developed with assistance from the Research Coordination Network and National Science Foundation. The executive order also reiterates its calls for bipartisan legislation from Congress addressing the broader privacy issues that AI systems present for consumers.\n\nIn terms of healthcare, the EO states that the Department of Health and Human Services will establish a safety program that tracks and remedies unsafe, AI-based medical practices. Educators will also see support from the federal government in using AI-based educational tools like personalized chatbot tutoring.\n\nWorker protections\n\nThe Biden administration concedes that while the AI revolution is a decided boon for business, its capabilities make it a threat to worker security through job displacement and intrusive workplace surveillance. The EO seeks to address these issues with \u201cthe development of principles and employer best practices that mitigate the harms and maximize the benefit of AI for workers,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cWe encourage federal agencies to adopt these guidelines in the administration of their programs.\u201d\n\nRichard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nThe EO will also direct the Department of Labor and the Council of Economic Advisors to both study how AI might impact the labor market and how the federal government might better support workers \u201cfacing labor disruption\u201d moving forward. Administration officials also pointed to the potential benefits that AI might bring to the federal bureaucracy including cutting costs, and increasing cybersecurity efficacy. \u201cThere's a lot of opportunity here, but we have to to ensure the responsible government development and deployment of AI,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nTo that end, the administration is launching on Monday a new federal jobs portal, AI.gov, which will offer information and guidance on available fellowship programs for folks looking for work with the federal government. \u201cWe're trying to get more AI talent across the board,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cPrograms like the US Digital Service, the Presidential Innovation Fellowship and USA jobs \u2014 doing as much as we can to get talent in the door.\u201d The White House is also looking to expand existing immigration rules to streamline visa criteria, interviews and reviews for folks trying to move to and work in the US in these advanced industries.\n\nThe White House reportedly did not brief the industry on this particular swath of radical policy changes, though administration officials did note that they had already been collaborating extensively with AI companies on many of these issues. The Senate held its second AI Insight Forum event last week on Capitol Hill, while Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to speak at the UK Summit on AI Safety, hosted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\nAt an event hosted by The Washington Post on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was already arguing that the executive order did not go far enough and could not be considered an effective replacement for congressional action, which to date, has been slow in coming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a limit to what you can do by executive order,\u201d Schumer told WaPo, \u201cThey [the Biden Administration] are concerned, and they\u2019re doing a lot regulatorily, but everyone admits the only real answer is legislative.\u201d"

    "body": "The past few weeks of the 2023 NFL season have reminded us that no matter how smooth you sail to start the voyage, choppy waters will surely come at some point. We started the first six weeks with a best bets winning percentage of well over .700, but we have come crashing back down to Earth over the past two weeks. We love our Week 9 best bets, though, and we're confident that we can all get back on track and make you some cash.\n\nEvery Friday afternoon, we unveil my favorite moneyline, spread, over/under, and player prop wagers for the upcoming weekend. We run the gauntlet and handpick the best value opportunities on Caesars and SuperDraft, then tell you exactly how and why you should attack the books to make some money. And through eight weeks, despite some bumps in the road, we have made plenty of money.\n\nDespite falling three bets under .500 over the past two weeks (5-6 in Week 7, 6-8 in Week 8), our best bets are still 65-46-1 on the season. That's a winning percentage of over .590, a number many professional bettors wish they were maintaining during this rollercoaster of an NFL season.\n\nAnd, look, last week wasn't all bad as Arnold Schwarzenneger might say. Sure, our ATS picks went 1-3 and our player prop picks went a pitiful 0-3. But our moneyline and over/under picks went 5-2. So, like the Chiefs after a pathetic loss to the Broncos (one of our incorrect picks last week), we're moving on to Week 9 with our heads held high.\n\nMORE WEEK 9 BETTING: Against the spread | Moneyline | Top props\n\nWe don't view sports betting as a gamble. With the right mindset, strategies, and preparedness, we see it as an investment \u2014 and we're loving our return on investment through seven weeks. That's why we don't just call this thing of ours a hobby \u2014 rather, it's a second job that allows us to punch in while we're sitting on our couch.\n\nYour goal is to boost your bankroll, and our top priority is to help you achieve that goal. That's why we put in a ton of statistical research, attack all the angles, uncover all the betting trends, and pinpoint value across all the sports betting sites each week.\n\nThis weekend's slate features a plethora of lucrative opportunities for bettors. So, let's go get that money and reveal our best moneyline, spread, over/under, and SuperDraft player prop bets for Week 9 of the 2023 NFL season.\n\nJUMP TO: Spreads | Moneylines | Over/under | Player props\n\nNFL Best Bets Week 9: Against the spread\n\nAll odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook\n\nColts (-2.5) at Panthers\n\nBryce Young has looked much better now that he has settled into his rookie season with the Panthers, but Carolina still seems like a work in progress. The Colts, meanwhile, have quietly been operating a pretty decent offense \u2014 much better than their three-game losing streak might suggest. Indy has scored 65 points between Week 7 and 8, 29 more points than Panthers have scored in that span.\n\nIn a Gardner Minshew-Bryce Young battle, we'll take the 'Shew \u2014 and the backfield committee of Jonathan Taylor and Zack Moss against Carolina's abysmal run defense just serves as icing on the proverbial cake. The Panthers have allowed the most rushing TDs (14), the third-most points per game (28.4), and the fourth-most rushing yards per game (139.4) during their 1-7 start. The Colts will cruise in this one.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Colts 27, Panthers 17\n\nSeahawks (+6) at Ravens\n\nBaltimore's defense has been incredible of late, and the Ravens seem to be flying under the radar (so to speak) at 6-2. However, the sportsbooks have clearly taken note of their awesome run, giving the NFC West-leading Seahawks a full touchdown on the road. This seems like a great opportunity for us to rock with the 'dog, considering Seattle has won two straight contests and gone 2-1 on the road (including a big win over the high-flying Lions in Detroit).\n\nGeno Smith hasn't been the same Pro Bowl QB as he was in 2022, but he has still demonstrated moments of brilliance for Pete Carroll's squad. And with DK Metcalf and Kenneth Walker III a week closer to full health \u2014 and backup RB Zack Charbonnet looking like he's on the verge of a breakout \u2014 we like Seattle to at least make this a game in Baltimore. The 'Hawks defense has quietly been pretty good, and we know what kind of fireworks this offense is capable of when everything's clicking. Take an extra 1.5 points as insurance if you want, but we're taking the Seahawks to cover the +6.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Ravens 26, Seahawks 23\n\nOther Week 9 spreads we like: Patriots (-3) vs. Commanders; Raiders -1.5 vs. Giants\n\nBest NFL moneyline bets Week 9\n\nDolphins (+110) vs. Chiefs (Germany game)\n\nWe get it \u2014 the Dolphins have yet to defeat a true contender this season and the Chiefs are the reigning champions of the NFL. However, Kansas City just got its doors blown off by Russell Wilson and the lowly Broncos, a game in which Patrick Mahomes and company suffered five turnovers and three sacks.\n\nWe expect a statement win from Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins on neutral ground. The Dolphins have been in Frankfurt since early this week, having flown overnight on Monday to give them multiple days to acclimate to the time difference and their surroundings. The Chiefs, meanwhile, waited until after practice on Thursday to take the 11-hour voyage.\n\nThis also happens to be a revenge game for former Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, who's on pace for multiple single-season receiving records and poised for his first Offensive Player of the Year award. Oh, and Raheem Mostert, who leads the NFL with 10 TDs and ranks second behind only Breece Hall in yards per carry (5.4), should be licking his chops against a Kansas City D that has surrendered 135.6 rushing yards per game over the past three weeks. Fins up in Frankfurt!\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Dolphins 26, Chiefs 24\n\nOther Week 9 moneylines we like: Vikings (+170) at Falcons; Bengals (-130) vs. Bills; Cowboys (+140) at Eagles\n\nBest NFL over/under bets Week 9\n\nRaiders vs. Giants: UNDER 37.5\n\nIt sounds ludicrous to offer an UNDER of 37.5 as a best bet, but this game takes the cake in a Week 9 schedule loaded with underwhelming matchups. The Raiders just fired their head coach and GM and demoted starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo after appearing lost on Monday night, while the Giants just got Daniel Jones back after scoring a combined 33 points across three miserable performances in a row. Oh, and Darren Waller, the G-men's best pass-catcher, is hurt.\n\nOn top of all that, the Giants and Raiders have both been pretty good on the defensive side of the football as of late, so expect Danny Dimes and Aidan O'Connell to have a tough time finding any kind of rhythm in the passing game. This won't be a fun one to watch, but it should be a fun result for UNDER bettors.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Raiders 17, Giants 13\n\nOther Week 9 over/unders we like: Colts at Panthers: OVER 44; Commanders at Patriots: OVER 41; Saints OVER 25.5 vs. Bears\n\nMORE BETTING:\n\nPick'em, Survivor Pool Picks | Chiefs-Dolphins preview | Chargers-Jets MNF preview\n\nBest NFL player prop bets Week 9\n\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\n\nRashee Rice, Chiefs vs. Dolphins in Germany \u2014 OVER 45.5 receiving yards\n\nAs soon as I opened up my SuperDraft app, Rashee Rice popped out as the first prop of the first game on Sunday morning (9:30 a.m. in Frankfurt). We love this rookie receiver and the big play ability he has consistently flashed over the past month. During that span, he has averaged over 55 receiving yards per game despite the Chiefs' games being decided by an average of 11.8 points per game.\n\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS & FANTASY PROPS: How to play SuperDraft\n\nThis one should be a tightly-contested, high-scoring game \u2014 with heavy playoff implications, because we all know this could be an AFC Championship preview \u2014 so expect Rice to be very busy through all four frames in Frankfurt. The Dolphins have allowed the fifth-most receptions and the 12th-most yards to wideouts this season. If a bounce-back week is meant to be, Sir Rashee is our destiny.\n\nAustin Ekeler, RB, Chargers @ Jets \u2014 OVER 29.5 receiving yards\n\nGuess who's back? Back again...Ek is back....tell a friend. The Chargers finally got their best player back to full health, with Ekeler exploding for 123 yards and a TD against the Bears last weekend. A whopping 94 of those 123 yards came through the air, as the PPR god gashed Chicago for chunk yardage a handful of times.\n\nExpect more of the same from QB Justin Herbert and his stud back against the Jets, who have allowed 46 receiving yards per game to RBs (sixth-most in the NFL). They'll try to shut him down this Sunday, but it would feel so empty without AE!\n\nJahan Dotson, WR, Commanders @ Patriots \u2014 OVER 45.5 receiving yards\n\nWe've come full circle with Dotson, who made our preseason sleepers column then faded into early-season obscurity only to emerge again over the past two weeks. Curtis Samuel was clearly not right last week, and the second-year wideout more than made up for it. Dotson caught 8-of-10 targets for 108 yards and a TD, a stellar encore to his Week 7 line of five catches for 43 yards. The banged-up Patriots defense will be primarily focused on stopping stud Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin, which should open up plenty of opportunities for Dotson."

    "body": "As Manchester United's season continues to slip away, the pressure around Dutch boss Erik ten Hag continues to get more palpable.\n\nThe latest slip saw the Red Devils crash out of Europe as they fell 1-0 to Bayern Munich on the final day of Champions League group-stage play, finishing bottom of their four-team group to leave them eliminated from Europe in their worst performance in the competition since 2005.\n\nOn top of that, they set the record for most goals against in a Champions League group stage by an English club, with 15 conceded in their six games. Their defensive record has collapsed as the season goes on: from a Premier League standpoint, they sit eighth in the English top flight, but their -5 goal differential is the worst of any club in the top 10.\n\nWith Jim Ratcliffe having now completed the formalities around his investment into the club, taking control of 25% of his boyhood club after a year of negotiations, the pressure will be piled on even more. Indeed, Ratcliffe wants United back at \"the very top of world football\".\n\nThe Sporting News has laid out all the options should Man United move on from Ten Hag and look for a new beginning, in the hopes of salvaging the 2023/24 season.\n\nMORE: How Man United produced their worst Champions League group stage in 18 years\n\nMan United next manager: Assessing candidates to replace Erik ten Hag\n\nIf Manchester United decide to pull the plug on Erik ten Hag's managerial tenure at Old Trafford, there aren't any perfect options for his replacement.\n\nThat allows us to speculate some as to who could slot in as the next man hoping to take United back to former glories, which still evade the club since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson over a decade ago.\n\nZinedine Zidane\n\nThe former Real Madrid manager has been out of work since departing the Spanish club in 2021, clearly waiting for the right position to open up. He was heavily rumoured to be in line for the France position once the 2022 World Cup finished, but Didier Deschamps surprised many by signing a new contract.\n\nZidane would be a top choice for United, as he would be for many top clubs with a managerial vacancy, but there's questions around whether he would be open to signing on. The 51-year-old told Marca back in June of 2022 that he isn't exactly thrilled about a Premier League job due to the language barrier.\n\nWhen asked specifically about a possible job opening in Manchester, Zidane said: \"I understand English, but I don't master it completely. I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play to win. It is a global context.\" Does he still feel the same way?\n\nGraham Potter\n\nWhile Potter's time at Chelsea crashed and burned, many still rate the former Brighton & Hove Albion boss highly and he could be in line for a project job such as this. Indeed, there have previously been rumours that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the INEOS founder on the brink of purchasing a 25 per cent stake in United, would like Potter at the club. He has been out of work since his Blues tenure came to a close back in April, but it would be a hard sell to fans after his time with the London club went so poorly.\n\nRoberto De Zerbi\n\nOne of the fastest rising managers in the game, Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi is known for his tactical innovation in transitional play, and his name has cropped up a number of times when big clubs have an opening.\n\nThe 44-year-old Italian has led the tiny club to new heights, qualifying for the Europa League for the first time in club history and establishing themselves as top-four contenders, building upon the success under Graham Potter. Yet could Potter's failure at Chelsea cause some trepidation around another Brighton success story moving on up?\n\nMichael Carrick\n\nThis list wouldn't be complete without mention of the likeliest of those with direct Manchester United links. Former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who made 316 appearances for the club over a 12-year Old Trafford tenure, is at Championship club Middlesbrough, his first permanent managerial appointment. They sit 11th in the second tier as of mid-December, just three points back of the playoff spots in a crowded top half.\n\nCarrick's lack of experience is glaring, but hiring someone with deep knowledge of the club could be very enticing, and the fact he hasn't bombed in his first job is notable. The 42-year-old has also led the Red Devils before on a caretaker basis, installed back in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal and leading the club to some big wins over Arsenal in league play and Villarreal in the Champions League before Ralf Rangnick took over.\n\nHansi Flick\n\nThe former German national-team manager only lasted two years on the job with Die Mannschaft, before their failures at the 2022 World Cup caught up with him. Yet Flick has big club experience, having led Bayern Munich first as an assistant under Niko Kovac and then for two years as manager, winning the treble in 2019/20 en route to being named UEFA Coach of the Year.\n\nYet Flick's lack of experience of any kind outside Germany \u2014 he has just one year abroad, as an assistant at Red Bull Salzburg \u2014 coupled with his struggles at the national-team level could give some pause at bringing him to England for such a project position.\n\nAntonio Conte\n\nFormer Chelsea and Tottenham boss Conte hasn't cropped up near the top of any betting lists, but there could be some sense in hiring the Italian to take over at Old Trafford. Conte has been out of work since his acrimonious departure from Tottenham this past summer, after he seemingly shoved his way out of the club amidst reports he was utterly miserable in London.\n\nWhile the idea of a control freak such as Conte taking over the Manchester United mess could easily be a recipe for disaster, the club could also seek out a fixer of his nature, hoping for an immediate boost they can build on once things crumble under the Italian, as they often do. Still, the Red Devils would likely have competition as he seems to prefer working in his home country.\n\nJulen Lopetegui\n\nFifty-seven-year-old Spanish boss Lopetegui represents maybe the perfect mix of experience, availability, and interest as Manchester United seek out possible new managers. Lopetegui is most known for his time in charge of the Spanish national team, where he succeeded Vincente del Bosque, but he also has big club experience at Real Madrid.\n\nLopetegui has also managed in the Premier League, seemingly on an upward trajectory at Wolves before abruptly leaving just days before the current season amidst tension with the board. And therein lies the issue around Lopetegui: he has left multiple positions in mysterious and awkward circumstances, with his Wolves exit reminiscent of his departure from the Spanish national team, where he suddenly departed just days before the start of the 2018 World Cup as news of his discussions with Real Madrid came to light. Between those two incidents, and his failed tenures at Madrid and Sevilla, would he be worth the risk at Old Trafford?\n\nNames that don't make sense as next Man United manager\n\nJulian Nagelsmann\n\nWhile the German's name has come up in betting circles as a possibility for the next Manchester United manager, there's no sense to this actually taking place. Nagelsmann was only recently hired as the head coach of the German national team, meaning there's no chance he is available until after Euro 2024 at the earliest, and in that case, it's likely that Germany flopped at their own tournament, meaning his hire would probably be quite sour. This one just doesn't add up.\n\nLionel Scaloni\n\nWhile it's conceivable that the Argentine could become available at a moment's notice amid speculation of his potential exit with the defending World Cup champions, this feels an unlikely pairing. Should he indeed leave Argentina, Scaloni has been open about his mental fatigue and is likely to take some time off from management. In the event he does return quickly, he's been heavily linked to Real Madrid as a possible replacement for the Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to become the next permanent Brazil head coach.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that Scaloni, who seemingly craves stability and routine, has no experience at club level, and lacks ties to the Premier League or Old Trafford (beyond a brief loan spell with West Ham as a player in 2006) would be a match for Manchester United in any capacity.\n\nGareth Southgate\n\nYou can sense a trend here as another currently employed national-team manager is mentioned in England boss Southgate. While he's been linked to the United job before, it would take a perfect storm for him to be installed, whether on a permanent basis or as an interim stopgap option.\n\nSome believe he could be considered next summer once the Euros are over: it has been speculated that Southgate could leave his England post following next summer's tournament, with his contract expiring in December next year. However, it's also possible he decides to stay on for the 2026 World Cup cycle, particularly if England have a good tournament in Germany. In that instance, he would only be available for double duty on a temporary basis, and that would simply be too messy to outweigh the benefits. Brazil are currently in that boat, and it's all gone wrong for Fernando Diniz despite his Copa Libertadores victory with Fluminense.\n\nMauricio Pochettino\n\nIn the event Todd Boehly proves to sport just as itchy a trigger finger as his successor Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, it's possible that Mauricio Pochettino becomes available should Manchester United look to move on from Erik ten Hag. But would he really be a sellable hire, having just failed in London after bombing at PSG and departing Tottenham in acrimonious manner? It seems unlikely that United would be interested in someone who demands significant club control and will have just been fired from a struggling league rival.\n\nManchester United managers since Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nIf Manchester United were to appoint a new manager, that person would be the ninth coach to take charge of a United team following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in May 2013, including caretaker/interim managers Ryan Giggs, Ralf Rangnick and Carrick.\n\nManager Honours Games David Moyes Community Shield 51 Ryan Giggs (caretaker) \u2014 4 Louis van Gaal FA Cup 103 Jose Mourinho Community Shield, Europa League, League Cup 144 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \u2014 168 Michael Carrick (caretaker) \u2014 3 Ralf Rangnick (interim) \u2014 29 Erik ten Hag League Cup *\n\n*Still manager of the club"

    "body": "Cover 7 | Monday A daily NFL destination that provides in-depth analysis of football\u2019s biggest stories. Each Monday, Mike Sando breaks down the six most impactful takeaways from the week.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers entered Week 6 riding a 15-game winning streak and looking unstoppable with a young quarterback, Brock Purdy, who was making the game look easy. They exited with a 19-17 defeat at Cleveland, injuries to key players and, for the first time this season, a question mark or two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles also losing ugly Sunday, this edition of the Pick Six column addresses key questions facing Super Bowl favorites with one-third of the 18-week regular season nearly complete.\n\nSo far this season, we\u2019ve seen the Miami Dolphins set NFL records for offense, only to lose by four touchdowns in their lone game against a true contender. We\u2019ve seen the Kansas City Chiefs win with defense, sometimes in spite of their offense. We\u2019ve seen the Buffalo Bills incur devastating injuries. Here we\u2019ll address 10 teams with the shortest Super Bowl odds, running through what I think and what NFL insiders have to say.\n\nThe full Pick Six menu this week:\n\n\u2022 Unanswered questions for contenders\n\n\u2022 When \u201cplaying to win\u201d goes too far\n\n\u2022 Championship roster, rookie kicker\n\n\u2022 Do they make wristbands for coaches?\n\n\u2022 Giants, Vikings and winning too soon\n\n\u2022 Two-minute drill: Wackiest win in a while\n\nGO DEEPER The Eagles' 'tush push' play is taking over the NFL. But is it working?\n\n1. Where do the top 10 current Super Bowl contenders stand one-third of the way through the season? Let\u2019s hit key questions facing the Chiefs, Eagles, 49ers, Bills, Bengals, Cowboys, Ravens, Lions, Dolphins and Jaguars.\n\nYou can scroll through the latest Super Bowl future odds from BetMGM below.\n\n\u2022 San Francisco 49ers: What do they have in Purdy?\n\nWhat I think: Let\u2019s start with what the 49ers do not have in Purdy. They do not have an AFC North-certified, weatherproof Ben Roethlisberger clone able to overpower the elements, break away from defensive linemen and thrive in the conditions Purdy faced against Cleveland. What they do have is a good, young quarterback well-suited to run Kyle Shanahan\u2019s offense at a high level by making quick decisions when given time to find open receivers.\n\nExec comment: \u201cThe 49ers knew they needed a good quarterback to win the Super Bowl, and they knew they could help Purdy be that. Give him a great receiving tight end, two good receivers and a great halfback who fits the system, and they\u2019ll get someone open on every pass play. But then Deebo Samuel gets hurt, Christian McCaffrey gets hurt, and now we don\u2019t have as many guys open. Especially when you face a defensive coordinator who says, \u2018You show me you can beat me throwing the ball outside the numbers \u2014 best of luck, and to do that, you are going to have to take a five-step drop and I\u2019m going to have Myles Garrett chasing you every play.'\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Kansas City Chiefs: Is the explosive passing game gone for good?\n\nWhat I think: The Chiefs have never scored less per game on offense through six games or a full season since Patrick Mahomes became their quarterback. They have also never enjoyed larger average point differentials (9.8 per game), because their defense is so much better. I think the pass offense will become slightly more explosive as Mahomes gets reps with his receivers, but I\u2019m not expecting a huge shift.\n\nThe Chiefs are averaging 9.5 plays per touchdown drive when starting at least 70 yards from the opponent\u2019s goal line, per TruMedia. That figure was 7.8 in Mahomes\u2019 first year as the starter and has climbed every season since. It\u2019s a testament to the Chiefs\u2019 adaptability, but also a reflection of plummeting explosive play rates.\n\nExec comment: \u201cYeah, it looks harder for them on offense until Mahomes finds (Travis) Kelce on every major third down, every major two-minute play, every major touchdown. Kansas City has the luxury of their best players being their toughest players. Chris Jones is a very tough player. Kelce is a very tough player. Mahomes is a very tough player. You wonder why they win the games? Because the games are won by the toughest teams most of the time.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Philadelphia Eagles: Has Jalen Hurts regressed? Where are the explosive pass plays?\n\nWhat I think: Explosive passing is down through most of the league, including for the Eagles. They are gaining more than 15 yards on just 11 percent of pass plays, down from 21 percent through six games last season and 19 percent for 2022 overall. Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert are still on the team, so I\u2019m inclined to trust the production will return. But there\u2019s also a lingering fear defenses have caught up to aspects of the Eagles\u2019 scheme. Does Philly have a counterpunch?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExec comment: \u201cPeople are going to crush Hurts and the offense. They are just churning the clock so much. It just feels like they are imposing their will on teams through the run game and through their short passing and it just hasn\u2019t taken off from an explosive passing standpoint, so when they play a team that can move the ball on them through the air, it presents some challenges.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Behind the AI magic that lets Amazon's Prime Vision show the NFL like never before\n\n\u2022 Buffalo Bills: Are the defensive injuries too much to overcome?\n\nWhat I think: The rest of the conference is the key variable. The Bills are diminished. They have imperfections. But Buffalo already defeated the Dolphins. The other AFC teams aren\u2019t exactly peaking. Kansas City and Cincinnati appear easier to defend this season than in the recent past. We\u2019ll see how well the Dolphins hold up. This can still be Buffalo\u2019s season.\n\nExec comment: \u201cMatt Milano and Tre\u2019Davious White, those are huge injuries for that football team. The Bills are not as dominant as they felt going into it with so many injuries on defense. But the division they are in, they will still be able to slug it out and get to where they need to go. Nobody has really emerged in the AFC to unseat these teams at the top.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Miami Dolphins: Has Tua Tagovailoa proven he\u2019s built to last?\n\nWhat I think: It was tough watching Tagovailoa last season without worrying for his physical well-being. I\u2019ve never felt that way watching him so far this season, and will feel even better if he plays a full game against Philadelphia in Week 7. New England, Kansas City, the Jets (twice), Washington, Tennessee, Dallas, Baltimore and Buffalo will all get their shots at Tagovailoa. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but think there will be games when defense muddy the picture sufficiently to create turnovers.\n\nExec comment: \u201cInteresting team. They put up 70 on Denver and should have put up 70 on the Giants. No one can keep up with that kind of firepower. But they also haven\u2019t really beaten anyone. They were down 14 points to Carolina. Do you think they are coming back from 13 down against Philly? In my opinion, no.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Dallas Cowboys: Is this team any better than previous Dallas teams that fell short?\n\nWhat I think: It\u2019s a tough time to evaluate the Cowboys fairly because they were so bad against San Francisco on a big stage in their most recent game. I just don\u2019t see where Dallas is better or going to get considerably better, especially on offense. And every time they enjoy success, they seem to enjoy it a little too much. That is a reflection of their owner.\n\nExec comment: \u201cRun defense and consistency on defense, and then offensively, what is their identity? They just are not very good. Their best games are when they play great defense and get turnovers, but that is not going to happen enough, especially against the good teams.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Detroit Lions: Have they fixed their defense?\n\nWhat I think: The Lions are 11.3 EPA per game better on defense from last season to this season, the second-largest gain for any team since last season. The schedule has something to do with that, but the 2022 defense was so bad, it couldn\u2019t stop Carolina. Detroit will win the NFC North and return to the playoffs, which will make this season successful no matter what happens from there. But we won\u2019t find out until the postseason just how much better the defense might be, because the remaining schedule features so many weak offenses. That includes Chicago twice, Green Bay, Denver and Las Vegas.\n\nExec comment: \u201cYes, I do buy them. This is a league full of teams who do not really know who they are week to week. Detroit knows who they are, and they play to their identity. Anytime you know who you are and play to that style, you have a chance to be dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Baltimore Ravens: Are the Ravens better off shifting to more of a pass-oriented offense?\n\nWhat I think: Baltimore has never scored fewer points or amassed less offensive EPA through the first six games of a season with Lamar Jackson in the lineup. The schedule and injuries have played roles, but with the Ravens shifting toward a more conventional pass offense, are the explosive quarterback runs mostly in the past? Jackson has one rush longer than 20 yards (he\u2019s had four or five by now previously). He\u2019s gaining at least eight yards on 15 percent of carries, half his previous rate. I\u2019m not expecting a consistent precision passing game to suddenly materialize. Will this new offense be tougher to defend?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExec comment: \u201cThe defense keeps them in it, but I don\u2019t necessarily think this offensive change is going to make them any better when it counts. Lamar Jackson does not appear as dynamic as a runner, but in this offense, he does not need to be. He is regulated to pass from the pocket, but you are taking away the biggest weapon the offense had when you do that. Odell (Beckham) is not that guy anymore. Who are you truly afraid of on that offense? Nobody but Lamar, and if you are not using Lamar in a certain capacity, he becomes just like the rest of these quarterbacks around the league \u2014 hit or miss.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jacksonville Jaguars: Are they ready for prime time?\n\nWhat I think: Trevor Lawrence\u2019s knee injury was the big concern coming out of Sunday. If he\u2019s out, expectations shift dramatically. More than the other AFC contenders, the Jaguars seem early in their life cycle, still finding their way. That makes them a little harder to trust in big spots but also leaves greater space for growth. Let\u2019s hope those test results on Lawrence\u2019s knee come back clear.\n\nExec comment: \u201cI like Jacksonville. Doug (Pederson) has a championship pedigree. This team is relatively young. They are scrappy. The fact that they have been there before gives them a chance. I think the quarterback is growing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Cincinnati Bengals: Can Joe Burrow hold up for a full season?\n\nWhat I think: Burrow is looking healthier over the past two weeks. The bye week comes at a great time for Burrow to get even healthier, but check out the schedule on the other side: San Francisco, Buffalo, Houston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville. Cincy still has a second game with the Steelers, plus games against Kansas City and Cleveland. I\u2019m worried Burrow will wear down against these defenses.\n\nExec comment: \u201cYou cannot always expect Joe Burrow to create magic with a bottom-half offensive line. The line is my concern all the way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Are teams sometimes going too far playing to win? The Eagles come to mind after falling 20-14 to the Jets.\n\nMost would agree teams have gotten smarter in their handling of fourth-down situations, going for it when it makes sense, instead of punting almost out of habit. Making the aggressive play to win can absolutely be the smart play, regardless of results. It\u2019s progress when teams seriously wrestle with these questions, not just on fourth down, but in all aspects of their strategy.\n\nBut when the Eagles tossed a killer interception on third-and-9 from their own 46-yard line while protecting a 14-12 lead against the Jets with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, a longtime NFL exec reached out with a question: \u201cHave we come too far with coaches wanting to \u2018win\u2019 the game instead of sometimes being more traditional?\u201d\n\nHis point: Philadelphia could have run the ball on third-and-9, then punted from around midfield. The Jets would have taken possession with barely more than a minute remaining, no timeouts and Zach Wilson behind center facing a ferocious Eagles pass rush. Was having Hurts pass in a situation when gaining a first down is unlikely the smart play under the circumstances?\n\n\u201cAre coaches not willing to go against the slight statistical benefit that WPA (win probability added) provides?\u201d the exec asked. \u201cIs it no longer OK to let your defense win the game when it clearly has a huge talent/performance advantage? This Eagles game was 14-12, not 37-35.\u201d\n\nCritics attuned to the trend toward aggressiveness pounce when teams pass up chances to go for the kill. Coaches know team owners tend to be fans, not football strategists. They know owners listen to these criticisms. That can provide an incentive to make the aggressive play, to go down swinging.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks they are playing Brady, Manning or Rodgers in two-minute,\u201d a veteran coach said. \u201cIf before the game someone offered Philly to put its defense against Zach Wilson on a need-field-goal drive starting inside his own 15 with no timeouts and a minute left, you think they would have taken it?\u201d\n\nIn the situation Sunday, the Jets\u2019 offense had netted 19 yards on its previous three possessions, producing one field goal on a drive that gained 16 of those yards. The Eagles had already suffered three turnovers. They knew Wilson would be taking over deep in his territory with very little time remaining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo me, these are exactly the type of factors that a coach needs to consider when deciding,\u201d the exec said. \u201cI think they were ignored here.\u201d\n\nThe situation Philly faced against the Jets was the seventh time since 2000 that a team leading by 1-2 points in the final two minutes faced third down with 7-10 yards to go from the minus-40 yard line to midfield, with the opponent holding no timeouts.\n\nThree of the seven teams passed, resulting in one first down, one sack and Hurts\u2019 interception. Of these three teams, only the Eagles lost the game.\n\n3. The 49ers lost Sunday when their rookie kicker missed from 41 yards. Is San Francisco wise trusting a championship roster to a rookie\u2019s foot come playoff time?\n\nThe 49ers raised eyebrows among some when they used their second-highest pick in the 2023 draft \u2014 a third-round choice, 99th overall \u2014 for a kicker. The selection of Michigan\u2019s Jake Moody gave the 49ers a cost-effective successor to veteran Robbie Gould. General manager John Lynch called Moody a potentially \u201cfoundational\u201d player whose stock in the draft was so high, other teams were trying to trade ahead of San Francisco for a shot at him.\n\nWho do you want lining up the potential winning kick in a Super Bowl? It\u2019s an interesting question in a season that has seen Moody and Saints rookie Blake Grupe miss game-winning tries, but the data could be on the 49ers\u2019 side.\n\nFGA Dist Rookies Veterans <33 Yds 97% [31-32] 94% [330-351] 34-44 Yds 75% [21-28] 82% [230-279] 45-50 Yds 78% [7-9] 73% [121-165] 51-55 Yds 100% [8-8] 59% [33-56] 56+ Yds 0% [0-1] 55% [6-11] Totals 86% [67-78] 84% [720-862]\n\nThe table above shows field-goal make rates in the postseason since 2000 for rookie kickers vs. veterans. The numbers stack up pretty evenly across various distance cutoffs. Based on these numbers, there\u2019s no statistical indication rookies are less effective in the postseason.\n\n\u201cPlayoff teams have a different aura, different feel in the locker room,\u201d a veteran evaluator said. \u201cPercentages are one thing, but who is the guy who trots out there to try the game-winner? It\u2019s a different pressure shooting free throws up by 20, down by 20, than in that type of situation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans might recall rookie kickers missing playoff kicks: Rodrigo Blankenship with the Colts in 2020, Harrison Butker with the Chiefs in 2017, Nate Kaeding with the Chargers in 2005. But the NFL has seen plenty of rookies kick effectively in the postseason as well. Evan McPherson made all 14 postseason tries with the 2021 Super Bowl Bengals. The 2017 Eagles won a Super Bowl with rookie Jake Elliott performing well. The 2012 Super Bowl champion Ravens had rookie Justin Tucker, while the 2006 Patriots trusted rookie Stephen Gostkowski.\n\n4. Do they make wristbands for head coaches? That is not the only question facing the Broncos.\n\nDenver Broncos coach Sean Payton has made clear his frustration with quarterback Russell Wilson in myriad ways, including when he suggested Wilson could at some point wear a wristband if it would help speed up communication in the huddle.\n\nWe joked on the Football GM Podcast that the head coach himself could have used a wristband to assist with game management after the Broncos called timeout before punting with 22 seconds left in the first half of a 19-8 defeat at Kansas City in Week 6. Payton said he thought Denver was heading into third down, not fourth, when he called timeout, helping the Chiefs\u2019 drive to a field goal.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an isolated miscue. Denver has twice this season used all three timeouts with at least four minutes remaining before halftime. Payton suffered that fate only four times in 258 total games coaching the Saints, when his association with Drew Brees was one of the most successful partnerships in recent NFL history. Payton has had it happen twice in six games with Wilson as his quarterback.\n\nRussell Wilson\u2019s hold on the starting job in Denver seems more tenuous with every game. (William Purnell / USA Today)\n\nAcross the league, teams have used all their first-half timeouts above four minutes just 14 times since 2020. That includes six times by Carolina when Matt Rhule coached the Panthers. Payton is the only other coach with more than one such game over the past three-plus seasons.\n\nThe irony is rich in Denver, where Payton\u2019s predecessor, Nathaniel Hackett, was mocked for his game management so thoroughly, the team made him hire veteran assistant Jerry Rosburg to help him after only three games (Denver was 2-1 at that point). The Broncos under Hackett had trouble getting out of the huddle on time.\n\nHackett took the hit for those issues, but when the problem recurred under Payton, the blame shifted to Wilson, the common denominator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is pointing toward a future in Denver that includes Payton but not Wilson. Payton\u2019s game plans over the past two weeks were conservative enough to suggest the coach was publicly demonstrating he does not think he can run his offense as currently configured, despite some success on the ground. These game plans were conservative enough to signal a potential in-season quarterback change. Denver faces Green Bay and Kansas City over the next two weeks before heading into its Week 9 bye.\n\n5. You play to win the game, but can you win too quickly? The Giants and Vikings are test cases.\n\nThe New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings exceeded expectations under first-year head coaches in 2022. Both reached the playoffs. Both are struggling in their second seasons, facing difficult questions about the future. Would they have been better off enjoying only moderate success early? That could depend on how well the football leadership has communicated with ownership.\n\nEvery head coach and general manager wants to win as much as possible, but the goal is to build for the long term, which can require time to do things with sustainability in mind. Bad teams that win right away can reset expectations for fans and ownership, making it less practical to take one step backward in the short term for a better shot at taking two steps forward down the line.\n\nWhat do the Giants\u2019 and Vikings\u2019 ownerships think?\n\n\u201cThe best first year can be that 7-10 season where you show some promise,\u201d a veteran coach with experience on a half-dozen teams said. \u201cThe Giants won a bunch of games early, people were heaping praise on the head coach, people get the expectation of what the quarterback can be. But oftentimes, you know different internally because you know the house you are living in. You are inside the walls every single day and you know where the roof leaks, where the foundation is cracked.\u201d\n\nBuffalo managed such a situation well. The Bills surprisingly reached the playoffs in their first season under Sean McDermott, a euphoric moment after a 17-year playoff drought. They went 6-10 the next year, then began a steady rise behind Josh Allen and a top defense. There isn\u2019t a Josh Allen on the Giants or Vikings.\n\nMinnesota in particular finds itself in an interesting spot, with Kirk Cousins approaching free agency and playing well enough, most likely, to keep the Vikings from climbing too high in the draft order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey already gave a contract to (tight end) T.J. Hockenson, and they are going to give one to (receiver) Justin Jefferson,\u201d an exec said. \u201cNow, what? Are you going into the rookie pool and taking the fourth-best quarterback in the draft? You can look like Atlanta with (Desmond) Ridder pretty quick.\u201d\n\n6. Two-minute drill: There were already many ways to win a game before the Dolphins invented another one.\n\nThe Dolphins were one of 223 teams since 2000 to be favored by at least 13.5 points in a regular-season or playoff game. Seventeen of those 223 teams fell behind by 14 or more. Six of the 17 won anyway. The Dolphins were the only one of those 223 teams to win and cover the spread, which was 13.5 for this game.\n\n\u2022 Six catches for 163 yards and a touchdown against Carolina left the Dolphins\u2019 Tyreek Hill with 812 yards through the first six games. That ranks second in NFL history to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, who had 819 yards through six with Green Bay in 1942.\n\nReceiving Yards Through Six NFL Games Rk Player Season Yds 1 Don Hutson 1942 819 2 Tyreek Hill 2023 812 3 Wes Welker 2011 785 4 Elroy Hirsch 1951 766 5 Santana Moss 2005 743 6 DeAndre Hopkins 2015 726 7 Raymond Berry 1960 725 8 Jerry Rice 1986 723 9 Bob Boyd 1954 718 10 Bobby Mitchell 1962 714\n\n\u2022 Jared Goff is enjoying the second-best start to a season for his career from a statistical standpoint, behind only his 2018 Super Bowl season with the Rams. With the Lions at 5-1 and Goff heading toward a likely contract extension, could another team come after his injured backup, former University of Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker?\n\nRandy Mueller raised the thought last week, recalling examples from his career as a GM when offering a pick one round higher than a prospect\u2019s actual draft round proved alluring. Detroit used a third-round choice for Hooker, who is recovering from ACL surgery. Hooker would have been valued higher if healthy. Could that be true again at some point in the future?\n\n\u2022 News that Indianapolis Colts rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson might undergo season-ending shoulder surgery could carry a silver lining. Richardson got to play enough for the Colts to evaluate where he stands, but if he shuts it down for the season, neither he nor the team would have to suffer through a full season of growing pains. Gardner Minshew\u2019s three-pick game against Jacksonville on Sunday works against the idea Indy is better positioned to compete with the journeyman in the lineup, but most coaches and execs I\u2019ve spoken with believe that to be the case in the short term.\n\n(Top photo: Dustin Satloff / Getty Images)\n\nThe Football 100, the definitive ranking of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players of all time, goes on sale this fall.

    "body": "Happy December, fantasy friends! We have somehow reached the final week of the fantasy football regular season, so the running back decisions we make in our PPR leagues this week could very well impact our playoff fate. Our Week 14 fantasy RB PPR rankings will help you optimize your lineup at RB1, RB2, and flex heading into this crucial weekend.\n\nIt hasn't been all holly, jolly this season \u2014 in fact, it has often been a bumpy sleigh ride. We've suffered a plethora of injuries to stud RBs the past few weeks, but we keep rolling with the punches and always do our best to stay two steps ahead of our opponents. One major positive is that only two teams will be on bye this week, a welcome relief after the six-team byepocalypse that was Week 13. Still, the injury-ravaged teams will have trouble replacing their studs and the deep squads will have difficult start 'em, sit 'em decisions to make.\n\nAs we do every week, we're deep-diving the running back position and analyzing all the stats, matchups, and injuries before breaking down our rankings. So, let's get to it and survey the RB landscape for the final week of the fantasy regular season.\n\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 14?\n\nAfter a whopping six teams were on bye last week, only the Commanders and Cardinals will be off in Week 14. That takes Brian Robinson Jr. and James Conner off the table, but it doesn't hurt us much beyond that.\n\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nIt does hurt a bit to have two below-average run defenses off the table, as Washington and Arizona have both ranked among the 10 most generous teams to RBs this season.\n\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 14?\n\nChristian McCaffrey (vs. Seahawks in Week 14) has given us no reason to stop believing in him as the best overall player in the NFL, so he stays atop this list. Austin Ekeler (vs. Broncos) has started to give us some pause as of late, as he's averaged fewer than 3.0 yards per carry since coming off IR eight games ago, but a juicy home matchup against Denver should be his get-right game. Clear skies ahead, Ek owners \u2014 the Broncos have surrendered the most PPR points in the NFL to RBs, and L.A. faces them twice between now and the fantasy title week.\n\nWith Jacksonville playing very well over the past month, we're all-in on Travis Etienne Jr. (@ Browns) even in a tough matchup. Trevor Lawrence and his high-flying offense should dominate the time of possession against the Joe Flacco-led Browns, leaving ETN plenty of opportunities to add to his per-game PPR average of 17.4 points (third best in the NFL entering Week 13).\n\nGuess who's back? Back again? Achane's back \u2014 tell a friend! Stud rookie De'Von Achane (vs. Titans) went right back to roughing up the opposition in his Week 13 return from a knee injury that sidelined him one week prior. The potential league-winner casually put up 103 yards and two TDs on the Commanders, and we can't help but place him and running mate Raheem Mostert in the top five this week despite a somewhat-tough matchup with Tennessee. Mostert has more PPR points than everyone but CMC, while Achane ranks just two spots behind CMC at third in PPR points per game (20.6).\n\nAnother stud duo, Detroit's Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery (@ Bears), also makes our top 10. They ravaged Chicago when they last met a few weeks ago, combining for a total of 193 yards and two TDs, and we have no reason to think the Lions will slow down in Week 13. Dan Campbell's squad just put 142 rushing yards and 33 points on the Saints in the Bayou this past weekend.\n\nSpeaking of New Orleans, old PPR reliable Alvin Kamara (vs. Panthers) has been a source of light for an otherwise-dismal Saints offense. With Derek Carr suffering a brutal blow in the Week 13 loss to Detroit, Kamara will likely shoulder the load against Carolina and its atrocious run defense. Entering Week 13, only two teams had allowed more PPR points than the Panthers (28.9 FPPG).\n\nWe also love Saquon Barkley (vs. Packers) against the Packers' leaky run defense and Breece Hall (vs. Texans) in what should be a bounce-back game. Entering Week 13, Houston had allowed 112.9 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs on the year.\n\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\n\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups Week 14?\n\nWelcome to the top 25, Tyjae Spears (@ Dolphins)! We've loved the way this kid has run all season. He averaged 5.1 yards per carry entering last weekend, and he stepped up in a major way for Tennessee when Derrick Henry sustained a game-ending hit to the head area against Indy. Spears contributed 20 yards on the game-tying drive in the fourth quarter and another 27 yards in OT, but Mike Vrabel's squad ultimately lost. In what should be a high-scoring game against the Super Bowl-hopeful 'Fins, we like Spears to be busy as rookie QB Will Levis's top check-down option -- assuming Henry (head/neck) is out, of course.\n\nEzekiel Elliott (@ Steelers) is another potential fill-in who should produce at least flex-worthy stats this week. With Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) on the shelf, Elliott could see 20 touches. Similarly, Kenneth Gainwell (@ Cowboys) and Roschon Johnson (vs. Lions) could see big upticks in touches if D'Andre Swift and D'Onta Foreman can't suit up, but we're not as confident those backs can produce given their matchups.\n\nWe still like Jaylen Warren better overall, but you can confidently take Najee Harris (vs. Patriots) out of the doghouse for good. Harris has been running with purpose, and his role in the passing game continues to make him a high-ceiling RB2 in a run-first offense that will be without Kenny Pickett (ankle) this week. New England might be banged up, but it's still a tough D to get chunk yardage against through the air. Look for Harris to see lots of screens and dump-downs in a rough-and-tumble Thursday night game in Pittsburgh.\n\nWe love Baltimore's Keaton Mitchell (vs. Rams) and think he has the potential to smash Los Angeles at home this week. The speedster has quietly racked up over 300 yards and two TDs over the Ravens' past four games, and with Lamar Jackson facing Aaron Donald and a still-talented pass-rush, John Harbaugh's squad might turn to the rookie to move the chains between the 20s. All we need is one or two big chunk gains to make him a worthwhile start \u2014 he can run friggin' 22 miles per hour!\n\nWEEK 14 DFS:\n\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\n\nWho are the biggest potential fantasy RB busts in Week 14?\n\nWhile he just barely cracks our top 25 thanks to his passing-down usage, James Cook (@ Chiefs) doesn't thrill us at Arrowhead against the pissed-off defending champs. Kansas City's front-seven has been tough against speedsters and more vulnerable to power backs, and the 5-11, 190-pound Cook 100 percent falls into the former category. Temper your expectations.\n\nWe feel the same way about Zach Charbonnet (@ 49ers). It's great that the Week 13 injury he sustained on Thursday night was just a bruise, but it's not great that he now faces a 49ers defense that already stifled him on Thanksgiving. You're probably starting him if Kenneth Walker III remains out with his oblique injury, but consider other options if you have the depth. The floor and ceiling remain low against this uber-confident Niners D.\n\nTyler Allgeier (vs. Buccaneers) continues to see his role diminish for the NFC South-leading Falcons, with dum-dum coach Arthur Smith finally realizing that Bijan Robinson gives the ATL the best chance at continued success. Tampa Bay has a pretty good run defense, so Allgeier can't be trusted outside of a desperate flex play with his nine average touches over the past two weeks.\n\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 14?\n\nDerrick Henry (head/neck), Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle), Kenneth Walker III (oblique), Aaron Jones (knee), D'Onta Foreman (ankle), and D'Andre Swift (undisclosed) are all \"questionable,\" at best, to suit up this week. We know for sure Stevenson will be out, but we'll have to monitor the injury reports throughout the week for the rest.\n\nJonathan Taylor (thumb) underwent surgery last week and will miss the next few weeks, opening the door for Zack Moss to resume his role as Indy's super-sub lead back.\n\nWe'll be updating these RB PPR rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.\n\nFantasy RB PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at running back\n\nRankings based on full-point PPR scoring formats\n\nRank Player\n\n1 Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks\n\n2 Austin Ekeler, Chargers vs. Broncos\n\n3 Travis Etienne, Jaguars @ Browns\n\n4 De'Von Achane, Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n5 Raheem Mostert, Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n6 Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions @ Bears\n\n7 Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers\n\n8 Saquon Barkley, Giants vs. Packers\n\n9 David Montgomery, Lions @ Bears\n\n10 Breece Hall, Jets vs. Texans\n\n11 Bijan Robinson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n\n12 Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. Vikings\n\n13 Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n\n14 Tony Pollard, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n\n15 Kyren Williams, Rams @ Ravens\n\n16 Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Colts\n\n17 Javonte Williams, Broncos @ Chargers\n\n18 Derrick Henry, Titans @ Dolphins\n\n19 D'Andre Swift, Eagles @ Cowboys\n\n20 Jaylen Warren, Steelers vs. Patriots\n\n21 Alexander Mattison, Vikings @ Raiders\n\n22 Jerome Ford, Browns vs. Jaguars\n\n23 Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks\n\n24 Najee Harris, Steelers vs. Patriots\n\n25 James Cook, Bills @ Chiefs\n\n26 Zack Moss, Colts @ Bengals\n\n27 Keaton Mitchell, Ravens vs. Rams\n\n28 AJ Dillon, Packers @ Giants\n\n29 Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots @ Steelers\n\n30 Aaron Jones, Packers @ Giants\n\n31 Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs @ Bills\n\n32 Tyjae Spears, Titans @ Dolphins\n\n33 Gus Edwards, Ravens vs. Rams\n\n34 Dameon Pierce, Texans @ Jets\n\n35 Roschon Johnson, Bears vs. Lions\n\n36 Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Chiefs @ Bills\n\n37 Kareem Hunt, Browns vs. Jaguars\n\n38 Tyler Allgeier, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n\n39 Chuba Hubbard, Panthers @ Saints\n\n40 Devin Singletary, Texans @ Jets\n\n41 D'Onta Foreman, Bears vs. Lions\n\n42 Chase Brown, Bengals vs. Colts\n\n43 D'Ernest Johnson, Jaguars @ Browns\n\n44 Jaleel McLaughlin, Broncos @ Chargers\n\n45 Miles Sanders, Panthers @ Saints\n\n46 Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks @ 49ers\n\n47 Dalvin Cook, Jets vs. Texans\n\n48 Joshua Kelley, Chargers vs. Broncos\n\n49 Royce Freeman, Rams @ Ravens\n\n50 Jeff Wilson Jr., Dolphins vs. Titans\n\n51 Ty Chandler, Vikings @ Raiders\n\n52 Latavius Murray, Bills @ Chiefs\n\n53 Cordarrelle Patterson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n\n54 Justice Hill, Ravens vs. Rams\n\n55 Rico Dowdle, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n\n56 Kenneth Gainwell, Eagles @ Cowboys\n\n57 Khalil Herbert, Bears vs. Lions\n\n58 Tank Bigsby, Jaguars @ Browns\n\n59 Samaje Perine, Broncos @ Chargers\n\n60 Chase Edmonds, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n\n61 Boston Scott, Eagles @ Cowboys\n\n62 Matt Breida, Giants vs. Packers\n\n63 Jamaal Williams, Saints vs. Panthers"

    "body": "Several would-be antidotes to the supersized and high-priced EV trend kicked the bucket this year. That\u2019s bad news for everyone, even if you\u2019d pick a beefy Cybertruck over something resembling a teeny Kei car.\n\nCars in general are no substitute for more efficient modes of transportation, including trains and bikes. But the last thing the climate and most budgets need is another tank-like truck or SUV. Large, heavy electric vehicles demand more materials and energy than smaller EVs; that means more avoidable greenhouse gas emissions during and after production. Despite these downsides, automakers build big because big sells.\n\nNumerous vehicles from startups and some legacy automakers challenge the \u201cbigger is better\u201d notion via compact designs and smaller price tags. Yet, little typically comes of their resistance. We observed as much with several ill-fated EVs this year, including the ElectraMeccanica Solo, Sono Sion and Mazda MX-30.\n\nHere we\u2019ll take a look at the small and low(er)-priced EVs that didn\u2019t make it \u2014 the flops, the failures to launch, the u-turns and holdouts of North America\u2019s size- and range-obsessed EV market.\n\nElectraMeccanica Solo\n\nLegally a motorcycle, ElectraMeccanica\u2019s tiny EV featured one seat, 100 miles of range and an $18,500 price tag. The automaker pitched the three-wheeled vehicle to city dwellers and delivery fleet managers alike. I never got to drive a Solo, but I sat inside one of these cuties last year and found it claustrophobic with the doors shut.\n\nIn April, ElectraMeccanica recalled every Solo over power failure issues. At the time, the company said it was pivoting to four-wheeled vehicles. ElectraMeccanica soon entered into a plan to merge with electric truck maker Tevva. In October, ElectraMeccanica inexplicably pulled the plug on that exit.\n\nHonda e\n\nThe Honda e debuted in Europe and Japan in 2020 with a 100-mile range and a $36,000-$43,000 price tag. The vehicle charmed reviewers with its city-friendly size and sweet-yet-vacant stare. Yet, as far as sales went it proved to be a total flop, thanks in no small part to its weak price-to-range ratio. Honda never brought the e to other locales, and by December this year, the automaker said it would cease production of the little buggy in January 2024.\n\nSono Sion\n\nGerman automaker Sono once led the charge to bring solar panels to electric cars with the five-seater Sono Sion hatchback. Sono priced the Sion (unrelated to Toyota\u2019s Scion badge) at $25,000 and intended to kick off production in 2023.\n\nInstead, Sono pivoted to selling to third-party automakers and laid off 300 workers. No longer an automaker, Sono now focuses on embedding its solar tech into other vehicles.\n\nGM, Honda\u2019s affordable EVs\n\nGeneral Motors and Honda said in April 2022 that they\u2019d co-develop millions of small and affordable EVs. They teased sub-$30,000 electrics for North America, aiming to deliver them in 2027.\n\nYet by October 2023, they canned the collaboration, vaguely citing \u201cextensive studies and analysis\u201d to explain the move. The announcement came as GM slowed its transition to EVs and Honda teased a \u201cnew global EV series\u201d of its own.\n\nMazda MX-30 (U.S.)\n\nThe Mazda MX-30 is small by Cybertruck standards (Tesla\u2019s vehicle is 25% longer and wider), but the only truly diminutive thing about the MX-30 is its 100-mile range and availability. Stateside, Mazda exclusively sold the MX-30 in California, the state with the most EV chargers by a factor of five.\n\nMazda said in July that it planned to discontinue the EV in the U.S. at the end of 2023. However, the automaker will continue selling the EV in Japan and the EU.\n\nRevel mopeds\n\nRevel \u2014 the Blackrock- and Shell-backed moped-sharing business \u2014 dumped its two-wheeled EVs this year in favor of regular-old electric cars. Revel said its moped ridership peaked in July 2020, at nearly 600,000 rides that month. In the years that followed, the company\u2019s moped ridership collapsed amid several deaths involving Revel mopeds, as e-bikes gained ground in cities like New York and San Francisco.\n\nVanMoof\n\nDutch e-bike startup VanMoof rode the high of the COVID-19-era bike boom into a $128 million Series C funding round. VanMoof proclaimed at the time that it was the \u201cmost funded e-bike company in the world,\u201d and co-founder Taco Carlier boasted the company was \u201creinventing, redesigning, and re-engineering every component of the bicycle.\u201d\n\nVanMoof\u2019s rapid growth and focus on proprietary parts led to its downfall. By 2023, the company reportedly lost money on each bike due to costly repairs, and struggled to raise additional funds to stay afloat. This past summer, VanMoof paused sales and Taco Carlier left as the firm declared bankruptcy.\n\nElectric scooter maker Lavoie acquired what was left of VanMoof in August for \u201ctens of millions,\u201d pulling it out of bankruptcy. Months later, it seems the acquirer has yet to restart VanMoof production or resume repairs.\n\nOn the other hand\n\nIt\u2019s been a bummer year for fans of small EVs, but all is not lost. For one, city bike-sharing programs are booming and increasingly electric. D.C.\u2019s Capitol Bikeshare notched a record 428,000 rides in the month of may. That same month, New York\u2019s Citi Bike recorded 867,838 rides in a single week \u2014 and the program continues to expand.\n\nBeyond e-bikes, Arcimoto lives on as the rare, three-wheeled EV holdout in the U.S. The Fiat 500e is coming to North America in 2024 (in limited quantities), several years after its debut in the EU. A startup called Telo Trucks is attempting to prove that Americans will buy small trucks again, and it\u2019s developing a pickup with the footprint of a two-door Mini Cooper. Plus, while GM said it would kill the Chevy Bolt and larger Bolt EUV, the automaker now says it will keep the latter Bolt around."

    "body": "Last night, former President and current Republican frontrunner Donald Trump appeared before a crowd in suburban Detroit and tried out his new attack lines against electric vehicles.\n\nEVs are too expensive, the former president argued (via The Detroit News); they don\u2019t have enough range and will spur American job losses. EV batteries were another target. \u201cThey get rid of them,\u201d Trump said, according to Discourse Blog, \u201cand lots of bad things happen, and when they\u2019re digging it out of the ground to make those batteries, it\u2019s going to be very bad for the environment.\u201d But those trying to protect the environment by promoting EVs are \u201cenvironmental lunatics,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments were the latest attempt to make electric vehicles a major wedge issue in American politics. President Joe Biden has made EVs a major part of his environmental legacy, and Trump senses that the issue could be used to leach support from working-class voters. But like most other recent efforts by Republicans to politicize EVs, it\u2019s largely incoherent and ignores the nuanced reality of how most autoworkers feel about EVs.\n\nThe latest attempt by Trump and his GOP brethren to make electric vehicles a major wedge issue in American politics\n\nThe latest wrinkle to this effort is the United Auto Workers of America strike, which has roiled Detroit and the surrounding area for the last two weeks and sent candidates from both parties scrambling to shore up support among workers. The strike is a watershed moment for the auto industry, with workers pushing for higher wages, improved job security, and more manageable hours. EVs are also on the table, with UAW President Shawn Fain calling for a \u201cjust transition\u201d to electric cars.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, though, is that union members aren\u2019t really buying what either party is selling. Workers may agree with Trump that EVs are too expensive or that the charging infrastructure isn\u2019t up to snuff, but they also don\u2019t want to see it stopped dead in its tracks. They also have concerns about Biden\u2019s efforts to accelerate EV production by providing incentives to automakers to retrofit factories and to car buyers through generous tax credits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people that are frustrated, just with all of them,\u201d Aaron Westaway, a UAW member from outside Detroit, told E&E News. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy with Trump, nobody\u2019s happy with Biden.\u201d\n\nThe concerns among union workers reflect the attitudes of most Americans, writ large. According to Pew Research, 50 percent of US adults say they are unlikely to buy an EV, while 38 percent said they were likely to consider a battery-powered vehicle. Concerns about charging and range are at the top of the list. But environmental concerns also rank high, with many people saying they would consider an EV as a way to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nWhat often goes unsaid about autoworkers and their attitudes about EVs is where the money is flowing. And right now, much of it is going to factories and plants outside their strongholds in the Midwest. Ford is building a massive battery plant in Tennessee, for example, as a joint venture with Korean battery maker SK Innovation. Meanwhile, workers at a General Motors joint venture battery plant in Ohio overwhelmingly voted in favor of unionizing under the UAW late last year, in a major win for the union.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s happy with Trump, nobody\u2019s happy with Biden.\u201d\n\nIf more factories follow their lead, and more of the EV transition is being meted out on the union\u2019s terms, it\u2019s likely worker attitudes will shift in favor of electrification. But right now, most of the work on electric vehicles is being done by non-union labor. And experts say that needs to change in order for opinions to soften.\n\n\u201cWhat this industry narrative about UAW\u2019s demands costing too much alongside the EV transition seems to neglect is the fact that auto companies are getting billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded EV subsidies to make it work,\u201d Sydney Ghazarian, an organizer with the climate-focused Labor Network for Sustainability, said on the Citations Needed podcast recently. \u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to use public funding in ways that serve the public and planetary good, you know, and central to that is not leaving workers and communities behind in the transition to a green economy.\u201d\n\nGhazarian argued that Trump and the GOP\u2019s attacks on EVs smacks of \u201cfaux populism\u201d since Republicans largely stand opposed to unionization. When he was president, Trump appointed anti-union judges and anti-union members to the National Labor Relations Board. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court judges also issued rulings that were devastating to public sector unions. And his promises to prevent auto factories from shutting down largely failed.\n\nStill, Biden has his work cut out for him as he seeks to shore up support among working-class families. Biden became the first modern president to visit a picket line this week when he stood alongside striking UAW members in Wayne County, Michigan. Biden told workers they \u201cdeserve a significant raise,\u201d citing the record profits made by the Big Three automakers, Ford, GM, and Stellantis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to use public funding in ways that serve the public and planetary good\u201d\n\nBut his efforts to frame the EV transition as good for workers as it will be for the environment is still a work in progress. Striking UAW members may be skeptical about whether EVs are affordable or practical enough for themselves, but that reflects widely held attitudes about the rapid shift to electric. And that skepticism can\u2019t be ignored \u2014 which is why the Biden administration is prioritizing billions in federal funding for the installation of a robust EV charging network.\n\nAffordability is still a major concern, but vehicle prices are going up across the board, both for EVs and for gas vehicles. And automakers are still losing billions of dollars each year on EVs, with their gas-vehicle profits being redirected into the enormous investments needed to fund the transition.\n\nWhat is clear is that nothing is likely to stop the EV train now that it\u2019s in motion. The automakers are committed, and UAW leadership wants to ensure that workers get to share the profits. And China looms large over everything, with the country producing the bulk of the components that go into EVs \u2014 a major concern of the union.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t clear is whether Trump\u2019s plan to drive a wedge between autoworkers and environmentalists will pay off. In his speech Wednesday, Trump tried to play up the division, heaping blame on Biden and the Democrats for the uncertainty around EVs.\n\n\u201cThe auto industry is being assassinated,\u201d Trump said, according to Detroit News. \u201cIf you want to buy an electric car, that\u2019s absolutely fine. I\u2019m all for it. But we should not be forcing consumers to buy electric vehicles they don\u2019t want to buy.\u201d\n\nBut he also cast the union\u2019s strike as largely pointless and, in a major head-scratcher, said that autoworkers would likely be out of work in a few years anyway, so why bother? \u201cYou\u2019re all on picket lines and everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference what you get because, in two years, you\u2019re all going to be out of business.\u201d"

Fill up your digital shopping cart instead with these Walmart Cyber Monday deals on some of the best devices we've tested this year\u2014no door-breaking necessary.\n\nWe test products year-round and handpicked these deals. The discounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide periodically.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nTop Deals\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nPC and Gaming Deals\n\nNeed a new laptop? We test dozens throughout the year. Check out our Best Laptops, Best Cheap Laptops, Best Linux Laptops, and Best Gaming Laptops guides for more options.\n\nNintendo Switch OLED Photograph: Nintendo\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED (8/10, WIRED Recommends) typically sells for $349, but this bundle includes a digital download of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as well as a three-month Nintendo Switch Online membership. Those extras usually cost $60 and $10, respectively, so it's like you're getting $70 worth of bonuses for free.\n\nWe like the 14-inch version of this laptop, which features most of the same components. You get an AMD Ryzen 7 (7730U) processor, 16 gigabytes of RAM, and 512 gigabytes of storage with a 16-inch touchscreen. That's plenty of power for just about everything, and the large screen is nice for editing photos and browsing the web. It's not a good choice if you're a video editor or gamer, but it'll do for the rest of us.\n\nThis is the newer, faster version of one of our top picks in our Best Cheap Laptops guide. You're getting a newer Intel chip (13th gen i5), more RAM (16 gigabytes, a must-have with Windows 11), and a nicer IPS display all for the same price as the pick in our guide. Again, it's not a gaming rig, but it's fast enough for everyday tasks like browsing the web and editing documents.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is a good deal on an excellent controller, and the price extends to several different color options. Our favorite part about the DualSense controller is the way the haptic feedback works. Rather than random rumbles, you'll feel directional and immersive feedback\u2014almost like surround sound, but in a controller.\n\nNearly any monitor can be rotated to be a vertical monitor, and we love them for a work-from-home setup. However, the LG DualUp is made to be vertical and comes with a wider aspect ratio (16:18) to accommodate its upright lifestyle. You'll see less content cut off, and it isn't as narrow on your eyes. It also has great color and comes with an arm mount that makes it easy to set up.\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nHome and Kitchen Deals\n\nWe've got the kitchen covered with our Best Blenders, Best Juicers, and Best Chef's Knives guides.\n\nPhotograph: Target\n\nMixers haven't changed much since they were introduced over a century ago, which is always the mark of a great tool. This 4.5-quart bowl model is slightly less powerful than some, but it's still strong enough to knead dough, cream butter, and whip up big batches of holiday cookies.\n\nAs a mid-level model in Dyson's lineup, the V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a few bells and whistles, such as an LCD screen that allows you to select one of three power levels and see the remaining battery level and filter and blockage information, among other things. Like all of Dyson's stick vacuums, it's lightweight and easy to maneuver around tight homes.\n\nThis is our favorite cordless vacuum. Aside from reliable suction power, even on corrugated surfaces, it also stands on its own\u2014a feature you'd think more cordless vacuums would have, but it's surprisingly rare. The Extreme Max converts to a hand vac in a few moments and comes with three attachments.\n\nDyson is a master of wedging function into beautiful form. When we tested the Pure Hot + Cool, we were struck by how well it integrates a fan, electric heater, and air purifier into one. It's capable of filtering out 99.97 percent of particles 0.3 microns in size, and its built-in air quality monitor displays indoor VOC and particulate levels on a bright, easy-to-read display.\n\nPhotograph: Bissell\n\nThis is a match of the lowest price we tend to see for this little green machine. It made our list of the Best Carpet Cleaners and the Best Viral TikTok Gadgets. It's great for cleaning furniture, stairs, and vehicles.\n\nLow on caffeine\u2014and counter space? The K-Express is a mere 6.5 inches wide and 12 inches deep, yet its 36-fluid-ounce, removable reservoir holds enough water to make a round of coffee for you and your friends without having to constantly refill it. Just do the planet a solid and make sure to use Keurig Reusable Pods to cut down on single-use plastic waste.\n\nA good budget espresso machine is a rare find, but this one is our favorite. You'll get a solid portafilter, a reliable steam pump, and a steaming wand in a pretty compact body. Unlike other cheap machines we tried, the Stilosa didn't show signs of slowing down. I (Medea) was gifted this after I got married and it's easy to use whether I want to brew espresso or just stream milk for my coffee, and it takes up very little room on our counter.\n\nIt might look like a coffee maker, but the Ninja Creami (6/10, WIRED Review) makes ice cream. It isn't essential, but it's a fun kitchen tool if you're interested in experimenting with your own sorbets and ice cream recipes. Ninja also has a $17 Ninja Creami recipe book if you want ideas on where to start (though we wish it was included, rather than a separate purchase).\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nTV Deals\n\nBe sure to check out our guides to the best TVs, best projectors, and best soundbars.\n\nSamsung QN900C Photograph: Samsung\n\nIt's not often that a newly released TV goes on sale. When we called the QN900C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) \u201camong the prettiest you can buy,\u201d we gushed over the \u201cbrilliantly clear and detailed video,\u201d rich color shading, deep blacks, and butter-smooth motion processing. It\u2019s able to display up to 8K resolution, so your only issue (aside from the price) may be finding enough 8K content to show on it.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely loaded with detail.\" That's how WIRED associate reviews editor Parker Hall describes the picture quality of the C3, with vivid, high-contrast images playing out across the 4K display. Stunningly fast response times of 9.2 milliseconds and support for every current-generation console feature, by way of its four HDMI sockets, justified crowning the C3 as the Best TV for Gamers.\n\nWe call this our best TV for gamers for a reason: It has a lightning-fast response time of 9.2 milliseconds, and it has four HDMI 2.1 ports to connect your PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Switch. Outside of gaming, it works fantastically well as a TV, with perfect black levels, and a great center mount that helps you place it on existing TV stands.\n\nExtra large OLED TVs typically come with extra large price tags. This LG model is one of the rare deals that lets you have both top-tier image quality and a massive display at a reasonable cost. Perfect black levels and gorgeous HDR make this one of the best TVs for larger rooms, especially if you like darker movies and shows.\n\nPhotograph: Walmart\n\nWe've always liked Samsung's Frame models because they hide in plain sight. When you're not using them, the TV transforms into one of a myriad of famous art pieces, virtually disappearing into the decor. This is an especially large one, but it's perfect for a fancy living room where you don't want the TV to always be the center of attention. The 55-inch model is also on sale.\n\nAt its full retail price, the XR A90J faces stiff competition from the likes of LG and Samsung, but at this shockingly discounted price, you're arguably getting the best deal in premium-yet-affordable TVs, at least for the next few days while it's on sale. It features Sony's 4K upscaling to make HD shows and films appear as if they're in 4K resolution plus built-in Google TV.\n\nBose\u2019s Smart Soundbar 600 is a Mighty Mouse Dolby Atmos soundbar that offers clear and expansive sound from a strikingly small frame. Unlike a lot of soundbars at this price, Bose\u2019s model includes real up-firing drivers for immersive overhead effects, alongside good musicality, relatively punchy bass, and great network streaming features in a sleek and compact design.\n\nSony is best known these days for its OLED screens, but its LED TVs like the X90L still pack a punch with a mix of excellent picture processing, good brightness, and great local dimming for rich contrast. Like a lot of TVs this time of year, this 65-inch set is at the lowest price we've seen it all year.\n\nPhotograph: JBL\n\nThis versatile multi-piece soundbar system from JBL (8/10 Wired Recommends) not only offers some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion you can buy but it\u2019s also got a cool trick: fully wireless surround sound speakers. You can set them up behind you or even use them as Bluetooth speakers, then connect back to the main bar for charging and playback.\n\nKlipsch has a talent for crafting soundbars that put the sound first, often without a lot of frills, and the Cinema 600 is an excellent example. Built from a speaker-like MDF cabinet and paired with a massive 10-inch subwoofer driver, this system has a penchant for clear and powerful sound that\u2019s as good for music as it is for cinematic punch.\n\nPhotograph: Polk Audio\n\nPolk\u2019s Audio Signa 4 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) was already one of the most affordable Dolby Atmos soundbars of its kind, offering true up-firing drivers, a wireless subwoofer for beefy bass, and generally pleasing performance. It\u2019s all the tougher to pass up at this price, perfect for those seeking a no-nonsense system that easily upgrades your sound in a simple package.\n\nSony\u2019s HT-A5000 is a pricey proposition at full cost, but it\u2019s a killer deal at this price thanks to engulfing surround sound expansion and just about all the features you can pack into a bar this size. Extras include next-gen HDMI with VRR support for PS5 or Xbox Series X consoles, multiple ways to stream over Wi-Fi, support for both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, hi-res audio, and more.\n\nPhotograph: Sonos\n\nThe Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite soundbar for big home theaters. It comes equipped with three tweeters and eight mid-woofers to deliver deep bass, along with full Dolby Atmos support that can bounce sound off walls and ceilings in a way that mimics a surround sound setup. It was on sale for the same price during holiday sales last year, but it's the lowest we've tracked.\n\nThe Beam (Gen 2) offers enhanced sound with support for Dolby Atmos (with compatible TVs and streaming apps), a fast processor, and an HDMI eARC port for high-definition audio. There's support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and AirPlay 2 as well. For surround sound, you can also pair it with other Sonos speakers.\n\nBose has updated its Smart 900 soundbar to include better bass extension, helping fortify an already great sound profile. With true up-firing drivers, the system also provides expansive Dolby Atmos and virtual surround sound for a cinematic performance from a single unit, and this is the first time we've seen its price drop.\n\nBelieve it or not, this is the lowest price we've seen on this luxury Sennheiser model that's as much trapeze artist as soundbar thanks to its high-flying virtual surround sound and Dolby Atmos tricks. It's a hefty unit and doesn't include a separate subwoofer, but still manages to serve up punchy grooves, sweet and smooth musicality, and great convenience features like Wi-Fi streaming and an analog input at a price that's finally swung below the stratosphere.\n\nSamsung\u2019s HW-Q800C offers a lot from a two-piece system. Its mix of upfiring Dolby Atmos speakers and side-firing drivers provides an engaging cinematic experience while its wireless subwoofer adds a hefty punch to effects and streaming music that many competitors can\u2019t match.\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nWatch and Fitness Tracker Deals\n\nNot sure which is for you? We can help with guides to the best fitness trackers, best Apple Watch, and best Garmin watch.\n\nApple Watch Series 9 Photograph: Apple\n\nThe Series 9 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't enough of a leap forward to justify replacing your Apple Watch Series 8 (or even your Series 7), but if you're buying into the Apple Watch ecosystem for the first time or replacing your even-older smartwatch, you'll find a host of spiffy, new features, such as daylight tracking and haptic gesture control.\n\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fitness and sleep-tracking ring that doesn't require a subscription. Made from titanium, it comes in a few different colors and tracks your movements through the day and night to give you a huge data dump in the companion app. The fitness tracking is flaky and the black version scuffs easily, but the four-day battery life is good.\n\nThe Whoop 4 is our pick for the most unobtrusive wearable. There's no screen, but it offloads data to the companion app, which tries to guide you toward a healthier lifestyle and boost your fitness levels. The subscription is pricey at $30 per month, but you get a year included with this deal.\n\nWe make no bones about it. The Versa 4 is the best Fitbit smartwatch available. In our testing it lived up to its claim of six-day battery life (provided you don't leave the display on the entire time). The vibrant, 1.5-inch AMOLED touchscreen is easy and snappy to use, and there's plenty of Google apps, such as Maps to round out the rich features list.\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nHeadphone and Earbud Deals\n\nHave a look through our Best Wireless Earbuds, Best Wireless Headphones, and Best Workout Headphones guides for some help making the right purchase.\n\nPowerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds Photograph: Beats\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2019, but these are still our top recommendation for earbuds with the most secure fit\u2014making them an excellent option for the most intensive workouts. With an IPX4 water-resistance rating, they'll also stay protected from sweat and they have excellent sound quality.\n\nAs Sony\u2019s priciest wireless headphones, the WH-1000XM5 had a lot to live up to following the remarkably popular WH-1000XM4. Luckily they deliver the goods with upgraded noise canceling, a posh new design, and a more refined sound signature that adds up to a great package \u2013 especially on sale.\n\nBose\u2019s aptly named QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) arrived in October with only one notable problem: they\u2019re very pricey. Luckily they\u2019ve already gotten a discount, which makes it easier to land their class-leading noise canceling, great sound, and luxuriously comfy design that\u2019s loaded with modern features.\n\nPhotograph: Sony\n\nSony's WH-1000XM4 headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) have been a stalwart pair of wireless headphones for years now, and there's no secret to their success. Offering excellent noise canceling, warm and detailed sound, and a ton of modern features in a comfy design, they're among the best travel headphones you can buy.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy Buds2 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of our favorite wireless earbuds, particularly for Android users. They work best with Samsung phones, but they pair easily with any Android phone. They have solid noise canceling, up to 7.5 hours of battery life, and a wireless charging case to keep them topped off.\n\nBose's QuietComfort Ultra improve on the brand's top earbuds with a minor boost in noise canceling and new spatial audio skills, designed to expand the sound for everything you play. These buds were just released late this year and this is the first solid discount we've seen.\n\nPhotograph: JBL\n\nJBL's Endurance Peak 3 are that rare pair of earbuds you can feel comfortable wearing at the gym, on the trail, or even in the hot tub thanks to their hearty water resistance and sport-ready fit. They're light on extras like noise canceling but at this price, they're a great investment as your go-to workout companions.\n\nSony's WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Review) source multiple generations of great sound, top features, and excellent noise canceling, all wrapped into their most compact presentation yet. They're not cheap, so this discount is key if you're looking to be an earlier adopter of Sony's latest flagship buds.\n\nThe only issues we had with Sennheiser's HD 660S2 (7/10, WIRED Review) bass-enriched audiophile beauties were their high price and stiff clamping force. At this price, we can live with a tighter fit, especially since the payoff is gloriously clear and richly detailed sound.\n\nSony's working-class noise cancelers offer solid performance. clear sound, and impressive battery life at a much more reasonable price than the brand's top offerings. With this sale, they offer some of the best value in their class from one of the top names in the business.\n\nPhotograph: Technics\n\nThe Technics EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of our favorite top-shelf earbuds thanks to their fantastic sound alongside great features and noise canceling, and their ability to connect to up to three devices at once. This is one of the few sales we've seen all year, which makes their very high asking price a lot more palatable.\n\nSoundcore's Life Q30 are already impressive at full price thanks to noise canceling that punches well above its class, so this deal makes them something of a steal. They add to the package with accessible and adjustable sound quality, good features, and great battery life.\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nSmart Home Deals\n\nWant to smarten up your home? See our guides to setting up your smart home, the best smart lighting, and the best mesh routers to get started.\n\nPhotograph: Aura Frames\n\nAura makes the best digital picture frames. Photos look great, without being too bright and obvious\u2014you want a digital frame to look like decor, not a smart display. Aura has a few options, and they're discounted regularly. If you like the mat look, get this one. Aura's newest frame, the 15-inch Walden is $249 ($50 off).\n\nThese clever panels top our smart lighting panels guide and are a fun way to add ambient lighting to any room. Each hexagon is an individual light, and you can connect them in whatever pattern you want. The app lets you control the color scheme, set it to react to music, or set schedules. Just make sure you prep and use a level to put them on the wall straight!\n\nThese modular smart lighting bars can be installed on your wall and arranged into whatever design you want (just make sure you prep and plan properly). The Nanoleaf Lines (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are great for subtle ambient light, but they can also sync to music or even mirror your screen to add immersion to gaming. This is the cheapest we have seen the starter kit.\n\nEufyCam 3 Photograph: Simon Hill\n\nCapable of recording crisp footage at up to 4K with 16 GB of local storage on a connected home base (expandable to 16 TB), the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a smart security camera system. Integrated solar panels top up the battery and onboard AI can detect people, pets, vehicles, and even learn to recognize faces. It's a pricey system, and we stopped recommending Eufy cameras after a couple of security incidents but started testing again recently after the company took steps to improve.\n\nWith an impressive feature list, this versatile camera will appear in our Best Outdoor Security Cameras in the next update. It offers up to 3K resolution, a second telephoto lens to zoom in, 360-degree pan, and 70-degree tilt, and comes with a solar panel and 8 GB of onboard storage. The limited frame rate and flaky AI detract slightly, but it's a decent option for the backyard. We stopped recommending Eufy cameras after a couple of security incidents but started testing again recently after the company took steps to improve.\n\nThe smartest indoor security camera you can get, Google's Nest Cam (Wired) blends in easily and accurately detects people, animals, and vehicles. It boasts HDR and a high frame rate to make the most of the 1080p footage. Sadly, you only get three hours of history unless you subscribe to Nest Aware starting from a pricey $6 per month, though it does also include familiar face recognition.\n\nA solid Wi-Fi 6 mesh system from TP-Link, the Deco X20 appears in our Best Mesh Routers guide as the budget pick. It is a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) system with parental controls and basic security, and performs dependably well. It is frequently discounted, and usually hovers between $160 and $180, but we have only seen it this low before for Lightning deals.\n\nIf you want an elegant mesh system to bring Wi-Fi to every nook and cranny of your home, the Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite mesh systems. Easy to set and forget, it employs the 6-GHz band for backhaul. Each unit covers 2,200 square feet and can connect up to 100 devices. Sadly, they are not backward compatible with older Nest routers.\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\n\nSpeaker Deals\n\nWant better sound? Have a read through our guides to the best speakers, best bluetooth speaker, and the best gear for audiophiles.\n\nSonos sub speaker gen 3 Photograph: Sonos\n\nWe recommend the Sonos Sub (Gen 3) if your giftee wants to upgrade their bass. The third-gen model packs better processing power and more memory. It's also meant to be paired with Sonos' non-portable options\u2014like soundbars, speakers, and amplifiers (it won't pair with the Move, Roam, Port, or Connect). It's expensive, but top-notch. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nThe Amp is a great option for those looking for an amplifier to power their turntable, TV, outdoor speakers, and more at higher volumes. The front control panel is touch-sensitive, so you can either tap or swipe for things like pausing music and adjusting the volume. The Amp also connects via the Sonos app and comes with support for AirPlay 2. It doesn't come with built-in mics, but you'll have voice control if you pair it with another Sonos voice-enabled speaker like the Sonos One or Sonos Move.\n\nWhile the Amp powers speakers, the Port streams to an amp that then sends a signal to the speakers. Unlike the Amp, it doesn't come with a control panel, but you can use the Sonos app to adjust treble, bass, and volume. It also has support for AirPlay 2. As with the Amp, you can also pair it with other Sonos speakers for voice control.\n\nPhotograph: Bose\n\nBose's Soundlink Revolve+ offers excellent sound in a neat and water-resistant design with up to 17 hours of battery on hand. Normally sitting well above $300, this is the best time to grab this powerful portable.\n\nJBL's Flip speakers offer excellent bang for your buck, including great sound that's more detailed, powerful, and poised than you'd expect in a portable (and waterproof) design. The newest model also offers a separate tweeter for better detail. While this is a modest sale, given that you'll almost always pay around $100 or more, this is a great time to grab it.\n\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals"

    "body": "Consumers gearing up to buy the latest imported appliances, clothes or electronic gadgets this holiday season might want to spare a thought for the companies that will struggle to make money for the next few years hauling products across the ocean.\n\nThat\u2019s because the container shipping industry, cast as the Grinch that spoiled Christmas over the past two years with record-high freight rates and slow deliveries, is returning to its pre-pandemic place in the corporate world: perennial underachiever Charlie Brown.\n\nThe biggest carriers posted net income totaling $364 billion in 2021 and 2022, according to figures compiled by industry veteran John McCown, after a decade of scant profits. They\u2019ll likely drift back into the red this quarter as the rates they charge fall below costs and look to stay there for the foreseeable future.\n\nBooms-turned-busts have been more abrupt and sensational, but rarely has an established industry so tied to the global economy lurched from historic profits to below break-even levels more directly than the shipping lines that move 80% of the world\u2019s merchandise trade have this year. After Covid\u2019s massive demand shock, the culprit now is too much supply.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly concerned about the next 24 to 36 months,\u201d Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive officer of Hamburg-based Hapag-Lloyd AG, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe are going to see a downturn.\u201d\n\nConsider the tougher times facing A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the largest publicly traded container line. According to Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Stephane Kovatchev, the Copenhagen-based company\u2019s free cash flow, which reached $27 billion last year, may drop about 80% this year and could turn negative in 2024. That may weigh on the company\u2019s bonds, he wrote in a research note on Friday.\n\nRead More: Maersk Slumps After Forecasting Weak Global Trade Until 2026\n\nOver the past 10 days, Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and closely held CMA CGM SA of France \u2014 all top-five players that together control about one-third of the world\u2019s container capacity \u2014 said they\u2019re cutting costs as some fear the slump will last at least through 2024.\n\nSome executives are urging against price wars, which contributed to a wave of consolidation and at least one major bankruptcy in the years leading up to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cEach actor will have to be responsible to ensure that the market remains reasonable amid rates that are relatively low,\u201d CMA CGM Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez told reporters Friday. \u201cPrice wars after a while hurt not only those who start them but everyone.\u201d\n\nRead More: Shipping Giant CMA CGM Warns Against Price War as Profit Plunges\n\nSuch concern stems from a combination of economic forces: Goods demand is returning to pre-pandemic levels just as supply is rising in the form of new, bigger ships. It can take two to three years to build a container ship, which typically operate for about 25 years. So timing their launch and retirement with the ebbs and flows of the business cycle is inherently difficult.\n\nTo manage capacity in the short term, the main tools at the carriers\u2019 disposal are canceling individual voyages or suspending services entirely on trade lanes where demand is weak. In prolonged slumps they can also let charter contracts expire, idle some ships or sell old ones in the scrap steel market.\n\nKovatchev said what\u2019s emerging is a standoff between the strong and the weak. \u201cThe bigger companies such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have the cash to wait and focus on cost-cutting, as opposed to aggressive capacity reductions \u2014 for now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all boils down to supply, demand and who will blink first.\u201d\n\nOf course, the flipside of shipping\u2019s pain are lower costs for the manufacturers and retailers that own the cargo being transported, which ultimately helps central bankers tasked with bringing down still-elevated inflation across many developed economies.\n\n\u201cA couple years ago, it was double-digit inflation in goods prices and maybe a 4% or 5% increase in services,\u201d said Phil Levy, chief economist at Flexport Inc., a San Francisco-based digital freight-forwarding company. \u201cTo the extent you were getting inflationary pressure from goods, or in a very tight goods market \u2014 that has disappeared.\u201d\n\nCompanies including clothing brand Under Armour Inc. and furniture maker Lovesac Co. cited relief from lower ocean shipping expenses over the past quarter.\n\nWith inflation eating away at their paychecks, consumers are being cautious about spending and seeking cheaper ways to have parcels delivered.\n\n\u201cOur own data tells us that the wider economic picture may be having an influence on the services our customers opt for, with many looking for more cost-effective shipping options,\u201d said Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Europe. \u201cWe expect external business conditions to be challenging in the near term, and there remains uncertainty with respect to the timing of demand recovery.\u201d\n\nRead More: Powell Says Fed to Be Careful, Won\u2019t Hesitate to Hike If Needed\n\nFor the container carriers, the cost of moving merchandise can\u2019t stay this low indefinitely, because their expenses are heading in the opposite direction.\n\nTransiting the Suez Canal from Asia next year, for instance, will be 15% costlier, the waterway\u2019s authority said in mid-October without explanation. On the other main trade route, ships passing through the drought-stricken Panama Canal are facing long waits, surcharges, and time- and fuel-consuming detours around South America to avoid the delays.\n\nThose costs are small compared with the $1 trillion in investment the industry faces in the coming decades to decarbonize \u2014 a shift that will require engines that run on cleaner-burning fuels and new infrastructure to produce, store and transport the alternative fuels.\n\nThe big European carriers have issued estimates for the surcharges that\u2019ll take effect with shipping\u2019s upcoming entry into the European Union\u2019s Emissions Trading System in January.\n\nAt CMA CGM, one of the strategies to cushion the peaks and valleys of shipping is to diversify. The second-generation scion Rodolphe Saade, who leads the company started by his father, has used the pandemic windfall to invest in an airline, ports and logistics operations and even the media.\n\nThe Saade family is worth about $19 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That compares with $33 billion in April."

    "body": "LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. \u2014 The Buffalo Bills have a new safety this season.\n\nHe sometimes plays close to the line of scrimmage, even lining up in the gaps and banging helmets with interior linemen. They use him as a hybrid linebacker in a three-safety dime package. He has played free safety, strong safety, outside cornerback, inside cornerback, left linebacker and right linebacker. And more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysically and mentally, he is being challenged, but he\u2019s grateful, content and all in.\n\nThe Bills\u2019 new safety is Jordan Poyer. It\u2019s the same Jordan Poyer who played for the team the previous six seasons, the only player in the NFL to have 500 or more tackles, 20 or more interceptions and 10 or more sacks in that time frame, a Bills captain for the fourth time, an Ed Block Courage Award winner in 2017, a Pro Bowl safety last year and an All-Pro the year before.\n\nBut this is a new Jordan Poyer because of ayahuasca.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, NFL team facilities were closed because of COVID-19, so Bills defenders met in Washington, D.C., for a few days to train, study and bond.\n\nThe first evening, cornerback Josh Norman welcomed the players to his home, and out came the shots of tequila. When Poyer was handed a shot, he looked at it and then at his teammates.\n\nHe put it down.\n\nNorman and the others, who had never seen him turn down a drink, were taken aback.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d one said. \u201cCome on, Deejay Poyo!\u201d\n\nDeejay Poyo was Poyer\u2019s alter ego. Inspired by tequila and a turntable, Poyer became someone else. And for Poyer, there was value in being someone else.\n\nWhat his teammates didn\u2019t know was that Poyer had not put alcohol to his lips in about three months, since he downed a shot of tequila on March 13 in the Puerto Vallarta airport bar during a 12-hour flight delay.\n\nPoyer spent his childhood in Astoria, Ore., a picturesque town on the mouth of the Columbia River not far from the Pacific Ocean. His mother and stepfather worked at a juvenile detention center and raised him with a strict hand. When he was no longer under their watch, unsupervised as a freshman at Oregon State, Poyer drank. And drank and drank.\n\nIt never seemed to affect his play in college, where he was a consensus All-American. And despite his continued drinking, he made steady progress in his early NFL years.\n\nGO DEEPER Graham: Bills rally around Sean McDermott in another win over Chiefs\n\nIn his third season, when he was an emerging starter with the Cleveland Browns, he DM\u2019d an Instagram model after she liked one of his posts on Twitter. She was a freshman at Florida Atlantic, a small-town girl from the Adirondacks who knew nothing about football but thought Poyer was cute. He traveled to Florida to meet her, and before the weekend was over, Poyer declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry this girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoyer made numerous trips to Florida that offseason. That spring as Rachel Bush was finishing her freshman year of college, she learned she was pregnant. After their daughter, Aliyah, was born, Poyer signed with the Bills, and the family moved to Buffalo. He and Rachel married in 2018.\n\nHis drinking was out of control by then. He would down a six-pack of IPAs in 20 to 30 minutes for a quick buzz. Blacking out was a regular occurrence. His behavior tested his marriage, but there was a draw between him and Rachel like a north pole to south.\n\nAfter the Bills lost to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the 2019 playoffs, Poyer was crestfallen. He says he drank heavily every day for five weeks. At one point Rachel rid their home of all alcohol, but he would still sneak what he could.\n\nRachel says her husband hid alcohol from her beneath bathroom cabinets and other places \u201clike a child.\u201d\n\nHe was close to losing her.\n\nThe drinking, he realized, was an attempt to relieve stress \u2014 stress from football expectations and stress from family life. He was a worrier, except with a drink in his hand.\n\nPoyer went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Then another, and another.\n\nThe get-together at Norman\u2019s house was his first significant temptation.\n\n\u201cWhen I put that drink down for the first time, it was almost like I overcame a demon,\u201d Poyer says.\n\nThe more time that passed, the less Poyer wanted to drink. He has no desire for it now, and the smell of alcohol almost makes him gag.\n\nDespite a stellar career and a loving family, Bills safety Jordan Poyer \u201cfelt like there was something missing\u201d as recently as last year. (Dan Pompei / The Athletic)\n\nBeing sober didn\u2019t make him immune to anxiety and depression, however. In the 2022 season, he missed five games with elbow, foot, knee and rib injuries. When the Bills lost to the Bengals in the divisional playoff round, Poyer felt responsible for not doing more.\n\nAnd his angst ran deeper than football.\n\n\u201cI still felt like there was something missing because I have this beautiful house, a beautiful family, everything anyone could ask for,\u201d he says. \u201cI still felt a sense of unhappiness, a sense of not understanding who I was, and why I was the way I was. A part of me felt guilty just because I was living this way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoyer couldn\u2019t come to terms with why, despite all his shortcomings, he was in such an enviable position. His football journey was improbable. No major college wanted him until Oregon State came in with a late offer to grayshirt, meaning his scholarship wouldn\u2019t begin until January of his freshman year. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 2013 NFL draft, came into the league as a cornerback, was cut six games into his rookie season and then had to learn a new position with a new team. He took a blind-side hit that put him in the hospital for two days with a lacerated kidney and a concussion. His career could have been over then.\n\nYet by now he has outlasted 191 of the 217 players drafted ahead of him. And he hasn\u2019t just survived in the NFL \u2014 he has thrived.\n\nWhat had he done to deserve this?\n\nWas he justifying his good fortune?\n\nWould there be a greater purpose?\n\nIn 2018, Poyer saw a therapist for anxiety once a week. It was unfulfilling.\n\nThe answers were somewhere else.\n\nGO DEEPER NFL Week 14 takeaways: Bills playoff bound? How far can Joe Flacco take the Browns?\n\nIn the Quechua language, ayahuasca (pronounced \u2018eye-ah-WAH-ska\u2019) means \u201cvine of the soul.\u201d\n\nAyahuasca is a psychedelic drug made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub and the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It has been used for more than a thousand years by Amazonian tribes. Ingesting it can induce a dreamlike feeling, an altered state of consciousness, mystical experiences and euphoria.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Aaron Rodgers revealed he had taken ayahuasca and credited it with helping him have two of the best seasons of his career for the Packers.\n\nPoyer had never heard of ayahuasca at the time. \u201cMy first thought was eff that,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cYou crazy? I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d\n\nThe funny word kept showing up in different conversations on his social media feeds and podcasts. Poyer researched it and became intrigued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the difficult 2022 season, Rachel suggested Poyer take a \u201cguys trip\u201d after the season to check out. But \u201cguys trips\u201d usually involve alcohol, and he didn\u2019t want that. Sightseeing isn\u2019t his thing. \u201cWhat I really wanted to do was work on trying to be a better me,\u201d he says.\n\nHe discovered Resonance, a retreat center in Costa Rica on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific coast and the cloud forest of Monteverde.\n\nTo prepare his mind to enter a state of awareness, he was to eat only chicken, fish and salad for one month, with no oils and sugar added. Then he had to cut out chicken and fish for the week preceding the ceremony. He also was told to practice yoga and breathing exercises that would be useful if he experienced anxiety during the three ceremonies spread over a week.\n\nIn a tiki hut in a wooded, secluded area, a shaman presented each participant with a cup of ayahuasca brew, which is kind of like tea, but with benefits. Taste is not one of them. Poyer says ayahuasca tastes like earth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brownish and really thick,\u201d he says. \u201cIt almost looks like oil, but it\u2019s darker and thicker. It\u2019s one of the worst things you could ever taste.\u201d\n\nFor the first hour after swigging it down, he lay in a bean bag chair in silence, setting intentions. Poyer\u2019s intentions were to understand himself better and love better. Eventually, the shaman provided a second cup, and then, enchantment.\n\n\u201cAt first what it felt like was my soul left my body for a good two minutes,\u201d Poyer says.\n\nInitially, it was unsettling.\n\n\u201cPeople try to control it, but you can\u2019t,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt took me about five or 10 minutes to figure it out. The ego has to die so the medicine can work. In order to let go and let the medicine do what it\u2019s supposed to do, we have to just breathe.\u201d\n\nFor about the next hour, Poyer says the highest version of himself lectured him out loud. It was, in his word, \u201ccrazy.\u201d First, highest-version Poyer addressed his desire to understand himself better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was basically saying, \u2018Jordan, look at your life, bro \u2014 what are you mad at?\u2019 \u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt was what I needed to hear because I wasn\u2019t appreciating anything \u2014 not my wife, my daughter, my family, my house. It was all about me and what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThen he turned to loving better. It was, he says, as if a Pandora\u2019s box opened on how to love.\n\nThe remainder of the ceremonies, which lasted nine hours each, were about curiosity, energy and connectedness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how to be a good human,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it grounds you. Really grounds you.\u201d\n\nJordan Poyer is the Bills\u2019 second-leading tackler but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like for a defense plagued by injuries. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)\n\nTwo days before OTAs began last April, Poyer returned to the Bills\u2019 headquarters and stepped on the scale. The needle settled at 179 pounds, about 20 pounds below his playing weight.\n\nAfter resuming his regular routine, the weight came back quickly.\n\nHe discussed his experience with curious teammates, coaches and the team psychologist. Poyer hoped ayahuasca would elevate his football performances as Rodgers believes it did his, but it hasn\u2019t worked that way for him.\n\nHe is the second-leading tackler on his team but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like. What he has done, according to former Bills defensive coordinator Les Frazier, now an analyst for NFL Network, is enable his defense to be the best it can by lifting others through versatility, sacrifice, toughness and communication. Poyer wears his \u201cC\u201d well.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing OK this year,\u201d Poyer said during the Bills\u2019 bye week on the patio of his Florida home. \u201cI\u2019m not playing the best that I\u2019ve played in my career. There are probably two plays I really want back. But I\u2019m doing a lot. And in a very deep sense, I absolutely love that I\u2019m entrusted with doing as much as I\u2019m doing on this defense.\u201d\n\nAyahuasca gifted him in another way \u2014 with perspective.\n\nEgo is a powerful force in professional athletes. It helps them ascend and often hastens their downfalls. In previous seasons, Poyer believes his responses to successes and failures were too ego-driven. Football was him \u2014 he has an NFL logo tattooed on his left shoulder \u2014 and he was football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\u201cWe still have games left that I\u2019m excited about, but I knew some way, somehow, this universe was going to test me this year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lost DaQuan Jones, Matt Milano and Tre\u2019Davious White for the season. It\u2019s hard. This s\u2014 is hard. And it\u2019s not just (the losses). I\u2019m 32, not this young spring chicken anymore. You know, s\u2014 hurts all the time. But my perspective is I get to play a game that I love, and I\u2019m healthy enough to play. Every time you come out of a game, that\u2019s a win in its own way.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Bills training camp preview: Is 2023 final run for Micah Hyde-Jordan Poyer tandem?\n\nPoyer\u2019s commitment is such that last season, when a rib injury precluded him from airplane travel, he took a 32-hour round-trip drive to play in a game in Kansas City. He wants to lift a Lombardi Trophy badly, as much as ever. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, he believes he can handle the disappointment better.\n\nOn Fridays this season, Poyer, fellow safety Taylor Rapp and assistant strength coach Will Greenberg play crystal bowls at Bills headquarters. \u201cThe different tones that you can tune into can enhance chakras within you and help you heal,\u201d he says.\n\nHealing takes many forms.\n\nWhen Poyer was 12, Louis Dunbar, who has done multiple stints in prison for violent crimes, called him for the first time and stunned him with the revelation he was his biological father. In subsequent conversations, Dunbar often said he wanted to see him or come to one of his games. He never has.\n\n\u201cI always had this hate and resentment toward him I was holding,\u201d says Poyer, who doesn\u2019t know where Dunbar is. \u201cThis experience enabled me to let that go. I realize I wouldn\u2019t have anything \u2014 my daughter and my wife \u2014 if not for him. Even if it was just the seed he gave my mom. So someday I\u2019ll meet him, give him a hug and tell him I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nRachel has no interest in taking ayahuasca. But she is grateful her husband discovered it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter he did ayahuasca, he became like my dream husband,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI was nervous about what it would do to him, but he came back a totally new man, so appreciative of me and our family.\u201d\n\nBills safety Jordan Poyer with his wife, Rachel, and their daughter, Aliyah. (Courtesy of Rachel Bush Poyer)\n\nHighest-version Poyer made Poyer aware he was not doing the little things \u2014 waking up with a smile, giving Rachel a hug on his way out, or being present even when his attention could be divided.\n\nPoyer has turned off his DMs on Instagram and deleted his Twitter/X account. Instagram features a For You page \u2014 a personalized feed based on user engagement patterns. In the past, Poyer\u2019s was filled with posts of other girls, according to Rachel. Now there\u2019s nothing on Poyer\u2019s For You page except football and ayahuasca. She knows because they have one another\u2019s passwords.\n\n\u201cHis attention now is 100 percent on me, his family and his career,\u201d says Rachel, who has more than 4 million Instagram followers, an OnlyFans page and a line of skincare products.\n\nSome players feel more pressure when the end is closer than the beginning. The Bills have an out in Poyer\u2019s contract after this season. He isn\u2019t stressing about any of it. His focus is here and now.\n\nPoyer has thought about becoming a football commentator after retirement. But he has more to offer than sports talk. He could talk about why he\u2019s never had a vaccine, why Aliyah is homeschooled, or how he believes God transcends religions.\n\nHe could discuss why he has always thought he might be an alien. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019m not from this planet, always being the odd one out, having different perspectives, thinking differently,\u201d says Poyer, who is fascinated by stars.\n\nPoyer has what philosophers call epistemic humility \u2014 he believes knowledge is limited and filtered by personal experiences. And now he is beginning to solve the mysteries of his existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy life has been changed forever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd my purpose is to be a bright light for everybody that I touch and connect with.\u201d\n\nIn March, Poyer will return to Resonance for another retreat. Also planning to go are his cousin who went with him last year, and some first-timers \u2014 his mother, brother, a couple of friends and possibly a couple of teammates. He will be working on a documentary about ayahuasca.\n\nA handpan is a steel musical instrument that generates sound through vibrations. Sound healers and meditators often play the handpan. In Costa Rica, Poyer heard one for the first time and was drawn to it. Now he plays his frequently.\n\nNot long ago, Rachel returned home at about 10 p.m. and was tidying up the kitchen when, in the peace of the night, she heard something coming from the outside balcony upstairs \u2014 ethereal, haunting sounds.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like something you would hear in a dream,\u201d Rachel says.\n\nIt was music the old Jordan Poyer never could have made.\n\n(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe Football 100,\u201d the definitive ranking of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players of all time, is on sale now.

However, since Thanksgiving Day is a federal holiday in the US, some stores will be completely shut down on the holiday.\n\nFor example, both Target and Walmart announced permanent closures on the holiday in 2020, with the policy remaining in place ever since. The outbreak of the pandemic had initially pushed these chains to close their doors on Thanksgiving, in order to limit crowding and spread out the shopping season.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that all grocery stores will remain closed on Thanksgiving Day. In fact, there are some retailers that you could make your way to on the morning of the holiday, in preparation for your annual feast.\n\nOnce Thanksgiving Day comes to a close, many stores will be reopening on Friday. From there, shops be operating during their earlier or usual business hours, in preparation for some of the biggest sales of the year.\n\nHere are when stores open and close on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday in the US.\n\nWhole Foods\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some fresh produce to cook up a storm, then you\u2019re in luck, as Whole Foods is set to be open during the holiday season. However, they will run on a limited schedule, and hours of operation may vary, so be sure to check your local store. Whole Foods stores will be open on Black Friday, with hours of operation depending on location.\n\nCostco\n\nAll Costco stores in the US will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, as noted by the retailer\u2019s official site. Costco Warehouses will reopen on Friday, with hours depending on store locations. The retailer has already started some of its online sales for Black Friday, with some in-store sales going from 24 November through 27 November.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe retail giant will be closed on the holiday, before reopening the next day for Black Friday, an annual shopping occasion filled with store deals. Walmart\u2019s usual hours are from 6am to 11pm every day, but opening times on Black Friday are based on stores\u2019 locations.\n\nTarget\n\nThe beloved retail store will also be closed on Thanksgiving Day before reopening the next day for Black Friday. Hours of operation for the day after Thanksgiving vary based on the store\u2019s location.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s\n\nStores will be closed on 23 November in observance of the federal holiday. Trader Joe\u2019s stores will reopen on Black Friday, with hours of operation depending on each store.\n\nWegmans\n\nWhile Wegamans will be open on Thanksgiving, hours of operation are limited. For example, one Wegmans store in Brooklyn, New York, will be closed at 4pm, instead of at 11pm like it usually does. Opening and closing times for Wegmans can vary based on the location of the store.\n\nAlthough most Wegmans stores are expected to reopen at 6am on Black Friday, specific opening and closing times vary for each location.\n\nStarbucks\n\nEarlier this month, a spokesperson for Starbucks told Country Living that stores will be open on Thanksgiving Day. While its usual hours of operation are from 6am to 9pm, stores\u2019 opening and closing times on the holiday vary based on location.\n\nAlthough Starbucks is expected to operate from 6am to 9pm on Black Friday, specific hours vary for each store.\n\nAldi\n\nAccording to Aldi\u2019s official website, all stores will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. Aldi will be reopening on Black Friday, as its hours of operation are usually from 8.30am to 9pm. However, specific opening and closing hours vary for each location.\n\nDollar General\n\nThe low-priced retailer will be open from 7am to 10pm on Thanksgiving Day but times may vary depending on location. You can find out more on the day by heading over to the store\u2019s website. Dollar General is expected to be open during its usual hours during Black Friday, with specific closing and opening times based on location.\n\nCVS\n\nA representative with CVS told ThePioneerWoman.com that most, but not all, CVS locations will be open on Thanksgiving. To check your local store, be sure to head over to the CVS\u2019 website. On Black Friday, CVS locations will be open during its regular hours.\n\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts\n\nThe beloved coffee chain will be open on Thanksgiving Day but with limited hours. Opening and closing times of stores on the holiday vary based on location.\n\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts with reopen on Black Friday, with its usual hour of operation based on each store.\n\nWalgreens\n\nMost Walgreens stores will be closed on 23 November this year, according to a press release shared by the brand on 16 November. While this is the first time that Walgreens has closed its doors on the holiday, some 24-hour stores will still be open during certain hours on Thanksgiving Day, depending on store location.\n\nWalgreens stores will reopen on 24 November, with opening and closing times depending on the location of the store."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAs Thanksgiving fast approaches, Americans are in the midst of writing their menus and buying the ingredients for their lavish feasts. And although it\u2019s a day filled with food and family, there is another popular tradition that\u2019s held around the holiday: Friendsgiving.\n\nEvery year, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of the month, with the holiday falling on 23 November this year. While it\u2019s often viewed as a day for Americans to express what they\u2019re grateful for, that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone will celebrate. More specifically, the event has been viewed as deeply controversial over the years, due to the contentious history of the first Thanksgiving celebration in the 17th century.\n\nThe holiday has been linked to instances of cultural appropriation, with some Americans believing that its history is frequently white-washed, prompting them to condemn or ignore Thanksgiving as a whole.\n\nHowever, the holiday itself has inspired another tradition of Friendsgiving \u2013 which can be held before, during, or even after the 23rd of November this year. The activity typically consists of a celebration with close pals since some Americans don\u2019t have the opportunity to return home for the holidays.\n\nOver the years, people have celebrated Friendsgiving in a similar vein as Thanksgiving, with everyone sitting around the table for one big feast. It\u2019s also often done in a potluck style, with each guest bringing their own dish to contribute. However, you don\u2019t need to have a big meal to celebrate your Friendsgiving, as there are many ways to change up your usual plans this year.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of activities that you could do for Friendsgiving that aren\u2019t the typical sit-down dinner.\n\nShopping at local holiday markets\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nWhile Christmas is still over a month away, many cities in the US already have their holiday-themed markets up and running. And since Friendsgiving isn\u2019t necessarily held on the Thanksgiving holiday, why not use it as an opportunity to check out some new shops?\n\nFor example, in New York City, Bank of America is currently hosting its annual Winter Village at Bryant Park in Manhattan. At the beloved New York City spot, there\u2019s a wide variety of food vendors, so you and your friends can take your pick at what you want for dinner and dessert. In addition, vendors are also selling a range of goodies \u2013 from ornaments to jewellery to scarves \u2013 which is the perfect chance to do some early holiday shopping.\n\nHosting a movie marathon\n\nInstead of hosting a big dinner, you could opt for another budget-friendly activity at your home: hosting a movie marathon. With the help of your friends, you can make a list of any horror, romance, or comedy movies that you want to watch for the day. You could also top off the activity off by supplying an assortment of snacks for your pals, or by cooking a meal all together.\n\nYour movie options can also match the theme of Thanksgiving, with films like A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), Toy Story (1995), Addams Family Values (1993) and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (1973). If you want, you could add some Christmas movies to the mix, including Elf (2003), It\u2019s A Wonderful Life (1947) and Steel Magnolias (1989).\n\nGoing hiking\n\nDepending on the weather outside, your plans for Friendsgiving could consist of going on a hike. Whether it\u2019s at your local park or a trail that\u2019s an hour or so away from you, hiking is the perfect daytime activity for you and your friend group \u2013 no matter how big or small.\n\nDecorating or baking sweets\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nDecorating or baking some sweet treats is another easy indoor activity. Whether you make a pie from scratch or simply frost your ready-bake sugar cookies, it\u2019s something interactive for you and your pals to do together.\n\nYou can also opt for treats that are on theme with the fall and winter seasons, from baking an apple crisp to decorating gingerbread cookies.\n\nRunning a Turkey trot\n\nWhether it\u2019s before, during, or after Thanksgiving Day, many cities in America host an annual Turkey Trot run. The length of the race can vary, with options ranging from a 5K to a half marathon, so you and your pals can take your pick at what you\u2019d prefer.\n\nFor example, in New York City this year, one Turkey Trot is being held at the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. During the race, which takes place on 25 November, participants will be running for the Rolling Thunder organsiation, which is a non-profit \u201cfor mainstream athletes who are developmentally disabled or have other special needs\u201d.\n\nAt-home wine tasting\n\nTypically, a night out at the bars with your friends can get a bit expensive, depending on which spots you go to. In a similar vein, a trip to a winery can rack up a hefty bill, and it\u2019s not the most enjoyable activity when it\u2019s cold outside. With that in mind, your Friendsgiving plans could consist of hhosting your own at-home wine tasting.\n\nFor the occasion, everyone can bring a different type of wine \u2013 from red to white \u2013 and give a few sips from each bottle a shot. If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s a big fan of wine, you could even end up discovering a brand that becomes your new favourite drink. When hosting the activity, you could make your own charcuterie board \u2013 filled with different meats and cheeses \u2013 to pair with wine.\n\nPlaying a football game\n\nIf your friends have a fun, competitive side, you can take part in another outdoor activity. You and your friend group can host the event in any big outdoor space you\u2019d like, whether it\u2019s a local park or your pal\u2019s backyard.\n\nIn addition, football meets the typical theme of Thanksgiving, as a beloved tradition on the actual holiday is to watch a sports game with the family.\n\nHosting an early holiday gift exchange\n\nWho\u2019s to say that you can\u2019t give your gifts to your friends a bit early this season? While the winter holidays are still weeks away, you could use your Friendsgiving to host your annual gift exchanges.\n\nFor example, many friend groups in the US have opted for the budget-friendly activity of Secret Santa, where each person is randomly assigned someone to give a gift to. During the exchange, you then reveal to your pal that you\u2019re their \u201csecret Santa,\u201d before giving them their present."

    "body": "In addition to being the largest and most powerful object in the solar system , the sun is also one of the most enigmatic entities in our cosmic neighborhood, which makes it hard for researchers to pin down exactly how it works. We are constantly learning new things about our home star, and 2023 has been no different. From learning more about the upcoming solar maximum to uncovering ancient superflares and mysterious heartbeat signals, here are the top 10 things we've learned about the sun this year.\n\nSolar maximum is right around the corner\n\nDuring the solar maximum (left), the sun is much more chaotic than during the solar minimum (right). (Image credit: NASA/Solar Dynamics Observatory)\n\nThe major news about the sun from this year is that we are fast approaching the solar maximum and that it's going to be more explosive than we initially thought.\n\nBack when the current solar cycle began in 2019, forecasts from space weather scientists suggested that the solar maximum would arrive sometime from 2025 onward and be relatively weak compared to past solar cycles. However, numerous warning signs early in the year, including rising sunspot numbers , powerful X-class solar flares and changes in Earth's upper atmosphere , hinted that the solar cycle was not progressing as expected.\n\nIn June, Live Science published an exclusive, in-depth feature on the upcoming solar maximum, which revealed that the explosive peak would likely arrive by 2024 and be more active than the initial forecast suggested. And in October, space weather scientists released an updated forecast for the current solar cycle, which is more in line with what experts told Live Science.\n\nWhen solar maximum does arrive, we can expect to be bombarded with more solar storms, which will result in frequent auroral displays , radio blackouts, potential satellite problems and disruptions to the migration patterns of some animals .\n\nThe sun is smaller than we realized\n\nThe sun may not be quite as big as we thought. (Image credit: EVE, and HMI science NASA/SDO and the AIA, teams)\n\nThe outer edge of the sun's atmosphere, or corona, does not extend out quite as far as we previously thought , a study published in November revealed.\n\nUntil recently, the best way to measure the sun's corona was to observe it during a solar eclipse when it becomes clearly visible around the moon. But new technologies have allowed scientists to measure the oscillations, or waves, that travel through the corona. These waves do not travel quite as far as expected.\n\nThe difference between the new findings and previous estimates is relatively small: The sun is likely somewhere between 0.03% and 0.07% smaller than we thought. However, scientists say this could make a big difference in how we study our star.\n\nThe sun has auroras too\n\nResearchers have found that the sun can produce aurora-like phenomenon above sunspots. (Image credit: Sijie Yu)\n\nWithin the solar system, auroras were previously thought to only occur on some planets and moons. But a study from November revealed that the sun also has auroras (although they are a little different from the ones we see on Earth).\n\nAstronomers detected radio bursts crackling above a sunspot after pointing a radio telescope at the dark patch. The frequencies of the radio waves were very similar to the wavelengths given off by auroras on Earth , which strongly suggests a similar process is occurring on the sun.\n\nOn Earth, auroras are born when solar storms and solar wind bash into our planet and temporarily weaken our magnetic shield, which allows radiation from the sun to excite gas molecules in the upper atmosphere. However, researchers think that solar auroras are created by electrons that are accelerated to incredibly high speeds along the sun's magnetic field lines instead.\n\nBiggest-ever solar storm unearthed\n\nA superpowered solar flare slammed into our planet 14,000 years ago, ancient tree rings show. (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn October, researchers revealed that a superpowered solar storm, known as a Miyake Event, slammed into Earth around 14,000 years ago. And it could have been the most powerful solar outburst to ever hit Earth , experts said.\n\nResearchers found evidence of the cataclysmic event lurking within fossilized tree rings that were recently unearthed in the French Alps. The preserved plants all had off-the-chart levels of radiation in the same rings, which showed they all soaked up the radiation at the same time \u2014 and only a powerful Miyake Event could explain the levels of radiation the team found.\n\n\"A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for our modern technological society,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nAncient 'superflares' may have sparked life on Earth\n\nAncient \"superflares\" could have sparked life on Earth, researchers claim. (Image credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center)\n\nContinuing the ancient solar storm trend, a May study revealed that \"superflares\" from the early hyperactive sun could have provided the energy needed to spark life on Earth billions of years ago.\n\nResearchers recreated Earth's early atmosphere in the lab and fired charged particles, like those found in solar wind, at the primitive gasses and found that this created both amino acids and carboxylic acids \u2014 building blocks for proteins and all organic life.\n\nSimilar experiments recreating lightning have also created these compounds in the lab. But the team argues that lightning strikes would not have provided anywhere near as much power as superflares, which makes them a less suitable candidate for kickstarting life on Earth.\n\nHowever, much more work is needed before any concrete conclusions can be made.\n\n'Ghost particles' could reveal hidden dark matter\n\nNeutrinos spat out by the sun could lead us to a hidden treasure trove of dark matter. (Image credit: Artistic rendering by Christopher Dessert, Nicholas L. Rodd, Benjamin R. Safdi, Zosia Rostomian (Berkeley Lab), based on data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope.)\n\nThe sun may be harboring hidden particles of dark matter in its fiery guts and neutrinos , or \"ghost particles\" that are spat out by the sun, could be the key to finding them , a pre-print paper published in August suggested.\n\nDark matter is an elusive type of matter whose identity is still a mystery to scientists. Dark matter rarely interacts with regular matter or light but when it does it is theorized to emit neutrinos, which have almost no mass and no electrical charge.\n\nResearchers hypothesized that the sun's core may have a high concentration of dark matter and, if this is the case, they predict that it will occasionally emit slightly more neutrinos than normal. However, these extra neutrinos have not been detected so far.\n\nAncient anomaly in sun's solar cycle\n\nAncient texts from Korea suggest the sun's solar cycle used to be much shorter. (Image credit: Yan et al. 2023)\n\nIt currently takes around 11 years for the sun to complete one solar cycle, during which it transitions from solar minimum to solar maximum and back again. But a pre-print paper published in June suggests that past cycles may have been much shorter.\n\nResearchers studied ancient texts unearthed in Korea, which contain detailed accounts of auroral displays during the Maunder Minimum \u2014 a period of reduced solar activity between 1645 and 1715. They found that solar cycles during this time likely lasted only eight years .\n\nHowever, scientists have not been able to properly explain why the solar cycle shortened during this period.\n\nMysterious 'heartbeat' puzzle solved\n\nScientists finally got to the bottom of what was causing mysterious heartbeat-like signals coming from solar flares. (Image credit: National Centre for Radio Astrophysics)\n\nFor more than a decade, scientists have pondered the origins of mysterious heartbeat-like patterns within streams of electromagnetic radiation that shoot out of the sun during solar flares.\n\nThe streams of radiation, known as solar radio bursts, normally flow non-stop out of the sun. But sometimes, there are fluctuations or gaps in the stream, known as quasi-periodic pulsations, which when viewed on a graph look similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) of a human heart.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists studied some of these mysterious patterns produced during a 2017 solar flare. They found that the patterns were created by fluctuations within invisible fields of electrical current that run across loops of plasma on the solar surface.\n\nThe sun has shooting stars\n\nPreviously unknown blobs of plasma are raining down through the sun's corona. (Image credit: Patrick Antolin. Background image: ESA/Solar Orbiter EUI/HRI)\n\nIn July, scientists announced the discovery of a new feature in the sun's corona \u2014 shooting stars .\n\nThese \"stars\" are clumps of plasma that fall through the sun's upper atmosphere, like meteors falling to Earth, because they are cooler than the surrounding plasma and, therefore, denser.\n\nThese dense plasma balls can reach up to 435 miles (700 kilometers) across and seem to fall along magnetic field lines created on the sun's surface. Scientists dubbed this phenomenon coronal rain.\n\nMini solar wind 'jets' discovered\n\nSolar wind is constantly streaming out of the sun. (Image credit: NASA/GSFC)\n\nIn August, scientists got a step closer to finally uncovering the origin of large outflows of solar particles, known as solar wind, that shoot out of the sun's corona.\n\nThe European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spotted tiny jets of plasma, known as picojets, shooting from tiny dark spots on the sun, known as coronal holes. The mini jets are smaller than other solar jets but still pack a punch, and researchers think that they provide the necessary energy to trigger gusts of solar wind ."

Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nFor some reason \u2014 blame the encroaching winter, post-Halloween boredom, or simple copycat syndrome, you be the judge \u2014 November has become a big month for annual social-media-based collective challenges. From NaNoWriMo and NaPoWriMo to Movember and No-Shave November to, um, others, the extremely online crowd has focused on November as a month for group events and group discussion.\n\nFor cinephiles, the fun one of the batch is Noirvember, a collective urge to watch and compare noir movies. Unlike most of these other challenges, Noirvember doesn\u2019t have an organizing website, a sponsor, a fundraising goal, or an established set of rules. (Though individual participants have certainly proposed some.) So for those participating \u2014 or for anyone looking for the best noir movies, or the best way to get into the classic genre for the first time \u2014 we\u2019re offering a little help. Here are some of our favorites, for newbies and noir veterans alike.\n\nThe classics\n\nLet\u2019s start with a few seminal noirs, the basics you\u2019ll want to hit to understand the genre and its conventions.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple, YouTube\n\nProbably the most famous noir movie of all time, John Huston\u2019s adaptation of Dashiell Hammett\u2019s 1930 crime movie covers the basics: There\u2019s a hard-bitten detective, Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), on a case full of twists, turns, and double-crosses; a beautiful woman who lures him in and turns out to be full of lies; and a McGuffin everyone\u2019s after that turns out to be more than it seems. A prime example of a noir that\u2019s more about atmosphere, cinematography, and a complicated plot than about edge-of-the-seat thrills, The Maltese Falcon is a moody movie with a lot of great performances, but it\u2019s also one of those films that\u2019s been imitated and iterated on so much that it can feel a bit basic in comparison to its followers. Still, that also makes it one of those movies where watching it suddenly makes a thousand later cultural references and media in-jokes make sense. \u2014Tasha Robinson\n\nSunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Paramount Plus, and free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nStarting with one of the all-time great openings \u2014 has-been writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) wearily narrating over a shot of the police examining his floating corpse in a Los Angeles swimming pool \u2014 Sunset Boulevard is a stunner from start to finish. This one isn\u2019t a crime procedural, like so many classic noirs; it\u2019s about how Joe, out of work and fleeing the men trying to repossess his car, tries to find shelter with an aging movie star by promising to write her a comeback vehicle. He gets drawn into a drama he didn\u2019t expect \u2014 a drama that\u2019s exceptionally well acted and scripted. It\u2019s dark stuff about Hollywood dreams and how they die, with Gloria Swanson at her most captivating and frightening. \u2014TR\n\nDouble Indemnity (1944)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nAnother Billy Wilder movie told in flashback, Double Indemnity is one of the great genre-defining femme fatale movies, with Barbara Stanwyck as the lovely lady leading hapless chump Fred MacMurray into an insurance fraud scheme that involves murdering her husband. It\u2019s one of the great twist movies \u2014 everybody in this film is a potential double-crosser, and MacMurray as an insurance investigator is both tasked with solving the murder he committed and trying to cover it up at the same time. There\u2019s enough going on here to keep anyone guessing up to the last minute. \u2014TR\n\nMore in this category: Le Samoura\u00ef, Rififi, Laura, The Third Man, Touch of Evil, The Big Sleep, In a Lonely Place, Chinatown, Night of the Hunter\n\nNext steps\n\nWhere to go after the basics? This is where noir fans\u2019 mileage is going to vary most, based on which aspects of noir they like most. The mysteries? The fraught relationships? The twisty stories and unexpected reveals? Just the overall mood? Here are a few we\u2019d recommend regardless of which subgenre you\u2019re most into.\n\nM (1931)\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Max, The Criterion Channel, free with ads on Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple\n\nOne of the most chilling crime dramas ever put to film, M has an unbeatable premise: When a child murderer starts haunting the streets of Berlin and the police can\u2019t find him, the local crime bosses join forces to bring him down. Something like a proto version of The Wire, jumping back and forth from the police perspective to the criminals\u2019 side of things and humanizing people on both sides, M is a procedural with several unusual turns, built around a particularly memorable Peter Lorre performance. It\u2019s also absolutely packed with breathtaking shots and exceptional use of light and dark, and the final manhunt sequence is a classic all-timer. \u2014TR\n\nNotorious (1946)\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, IndieFlix, FlixFling\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\u2019s Rebecca is a defining noir classic, but fans who haven\u2019t dug past his topline roundup of classics shouldn\u2019t miss the memorable Notorious, a thriller-romance featuring some of his most touching character work. Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a German war criminal, is asked to use that connection to seduce and spy on a prominent Nazi figure (Claude Rains) for the American government.\n\nIn the thinking of the time, this involves ruining herself for good men like her handler and love interest (Cary Grant) by having sex with another man. In modern eyes, this looks like the stuff anime romance dramas and fanfic are made of: Deferring her own desires for her country, Alicia willingly enters a love triangle and invites plenty of tsundere. Will duty win over love? Will she get any good spying done? Is Cary Grant the biggest self-righteous stuffed shirt imaginable in this movie? Bring on the feels. \u2014TR\n\nMore in this category: Strangers on a Train, Ace in the Hole, Murder My Sweet, The Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, The Set-Up, Scarlet Street\n\nDigging deep\n\nFollow anyone on social media who\u2019s been at the Noirvember game for a while, and you\u2019ll see plenty in this category: titles that lack a Billy Wilder or Humphrey Bogart to bring them into the cinematic limelight, but that have plenty of their own memorable charms. Here are a few we recommend for noir fans who\u2019ve seen everything else.\n\nDetour (1945)\n\nDirector: Edgar G. Ulmer\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Prime Video, Criterion Channel, free with ads on Pluto TV or Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy\n\nEdgar G. Ulmer was a prolific director in the Classic Hollywood era and directed the groundbreaking psychological thriller The Black Cat, the first movie to star horror legends Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. It was a huge hit for Universal. But Ulmer was blacklisted from most Hollywood studios shortly after, when his affair with the wife of Universal studio head Carl Laemmle\u2019s nephew turned into a divorce and remarriage.\n\nThis is all necessary context for Detour, one of many micro-budget movies Ulmer made for Producers Releasing Corporation, the smallest of the Hollywood studios at the time. It\u2019s also a standout example of film noir aesthetics and low-budget moviemaking.\n\nDetour is about a down-on-his-luck young man hitchhiking from New York to Los Angeles to meet up with his love, who moved to Hollywood with the hopes of making it big. Along the way, he meets a mysterious stranger who upends everything.\n\nDetour\u2019s tiny budget gives the 66-minute film an odd aura, with sparse sets and back projection that is inconsistent at best. But the thing undoubtedly works \u2014 it\u2019s a haunting movie about the unluckiest man in the universe, and Ulmer\u2019s striking images (and an unforgettable performance by Ann Savage) through his evocative use of lighting paint a stark picture of an uncaring world. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nSudden Fear (1952)\n\nDirector: David Miller\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen young Jack Palance and his startling cheekbones in a \u201950s movie, this crime-and-seduction drama is worth it for that alone. But the real star of the show is Joan Crawford, in a particularly fantastic performance as a successful, wealthy playwright who winds up on both ends of a revenge scheme. When Myra Hudson (Crawford) boots handsome leading actor Lester Blaine (Palance) off her latest play because she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s convincing as a romantic lead, and then he \u201cjust happens\u201d to run into her, seduce her, and get her to fall for him, sharp viewers will think they know where this story is going. But that\u2019ll only get them one twist down the magnificently curvy road in this movie. It\u2019s another \u201ceveryone\u2019s a potential double-crosser\u201d story, directed with surprising style and a few winks at a noir-savvy audience. \u2014TR\n\nBorn to Kill (1947)\n\nDirector: Robert Wise\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu\n\nAn openly Hitchcockian drama that feels like a matchup for Suspicion, Born to Kill does some particularly terrific plotting around the idea that it\u2019s always exciting when the audience knows a lot more than the characters. Helen and Sam (Claire Trevor and Lawrence Tierney) are involved in different ways with the same double murder, but don\u2019t realize it. When they meet and are attracted to each other, viewers will see the threat looming ahead even when both characters are oblivious. More murder, blackmail, cover-ups, and a great deal of double-dealing follow, enough to require a scorecard to follow the action. It\u2019s a terrifically tense story where there\u2019s no mystery about who did the killing, just about what or who audiences should root for. Do these two crazy kids have a future together? Does either deserve a future at all? And how many innocent bystanders are they going to take down with them? \u2014TR\n\nLured (1947)\n\nDirector: Douglas Sirk\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, and free with ads on Roku. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nFor people only familiar with Lucille Ball as a comedian, this strange crime thriller is a particular blast. American in London Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is working as a taxi dancer when a friend of hers disappears, possibly the victim of a serial killer who\u2019s sending odd little poems to the police with every murder. The police ask Sandra to act as bait for the killer, which sends her on a bizarre, sometimes darkly hilarious tour of seedy London, as she answers lonely hearts ads and goes out to meet a series of strangers with the expectation that every one might be a murderer.\n\nBall is touchingly open-hearted in this movie, as a civilian who decides early on that she\u2019s a hard-bitten cop like so many other noir protagonists. But this isn\u2019t a satire or comedy \u2014 it\u2019s more in the mode of M than The Naked Gun, with the focus on the noose tightening around the killer, and the sense that anyone Sandra meets could be a harmless kook or a deadly predator. \u2014TR\n\nMurder by Contract (1958)\n\nDirector: Irving Lerner\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi\n\nMurder by Contract is a lean, mean noir that had a big influence on Martin Scorsese. The director has listed it as one of his guilty pleasure movies \u2014 calling it the film that influenced him the most, especially in Taxi Driver. \u201cThe film puts us all to shame with its economy of style,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMurder By Contract was a favorite of neighborhood guys who didn\u2019t know anything about movies. They just liked the film because they recognized something unique about it.\u201d\n\nIn Murder by Contract, Vince Edwards plays a methodical hitman who is asked to kill a witness in a high-profile case. When he finds out his target is a woman, he bucks \u2014 not on moral grounds, but because women are harder to kill, due to how \u201cunpredictable\u201d they are.\n\nIrving Lerner directs the movie masterfully on a minimal budget: It\u2019s a tight 81 minutes, aided by Edwards\u2019 fantastic performance in the leading role and a great all-guitar score from Perry Botkin. Catch up with a movie that inspired some of the greats, and learn more about film history in the process \u2014 all while having a great time. \u2014PV\n\nMore in this category: Force of Evil, Nocturne (1946), Female Jungle, Killer\u2019s Kiss, Abandoned (1949), No Man of Her Own, Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nThe neo-noirs\n\nSearch for \u201cbest neo-noirs\u201d online, and you\u2019ll get a thousand movies with dubious-at-best noir connections \u2014 practically all it takes to get a movie labeled as neo-noir is a voice-over, a procedural plot with a lot of night shots, or a downbeat ending. But there are plenty of movies that update the genre squarely and fairly, with an eye toward all the core conventions and the flavor that made noir such a memorable genre in the first place. Here are some of the best and most high-fidelity neos.\n\nThe Last Seduction (1994)\n\nDirector: John Dahl\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Peacock or free with ads on Tubi, Vudu, Roku, FreeVee, and Plex. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Apple\n\nOne of the most gleefully cruel, shockingly dirty neo-noirs to ever claim the name, The Last Seduction is a series of surprises that feels all the more subversive because the femme fatale is the protagonist, and there is no hero worth the label. Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) schemes with her patsy husband, Clay (Bill Pullman), to get her hands on a pile of illicit cash. Then she runs off with it and leaves him behind to take the fall. But she winds up stranded in a small town with time to kill and a second patsy to play with. This one gets particularly ugly by the end \u2014 it\u2019s a dark, dark story \u2014 but there\u2019s still a gleeful joy in the tightness of this narrative, and in Bridget\u2019s sociopathic skill at coming up with a manipulation for every situation. \u2014TR\n\nBlood Simple (1984)\n\nDirectors: Joel Coen and Ethan Coen\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Max and The Criterion Channel. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Alamo, YouTube\n\nFrances McDormand\u2019s screen debut and the Coen brothers\u2019 first movie is a must-see for neo-noir fans \u2014 the kind of tightly plotted, intensely acted, strikingly stylish movie they\u2019d continue to be known for in the decades that followed. It was a memorable debut for all concerned. A Texas woman (McDormand) cheats on her thuggish husband (Dan Hedaya), who sets out to kill her and her lover. But everyone involved seems to have a hidden agenda, and the threads get pretty tangled as they all come to the surface, with twist after twist making the action memorable. Blood Simple puts the visual darkness implied in \u201cnoir\u201d to particularly good work: It\u2019s the kind of movie where someone is always either lurking in deep shadow or forced off into a symbolic darkness that they might or might not come back from alive. \u2014TR\n\nBrick (2005)\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Redbox\n\nFor fans: possibly the best ever neo-noir not made by the Coen brothers. For detractors: a weird \u201cIs this serious or satire?\u201d experience built around a mannered, oddball script that reduces noir to a literal high school teen drama. (Actually, the fans might agree with every part of that second description, and just mean it much more positively.)\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the hard-bitten PI equivalent, a high school kid devoted to a girl who jilted him, then turned up dead. Johnson\u2019s script (presaging his later, equally complex murder mysteries Knives Out and Glass Onion) treats high school drama like big-time drama, and puts Dashiell Hammett-style dialogue in the mouths of modern teenagers, for an effect that\u2019s a wee bit comedic and a whole lot of fun. This one\u2019s full of fun surprises, but it also respects the genre and plays fair by noir fans rather than subverting the classics. \u2014TR\n\nBad Times at the El Royale (2018)\n\nDirector: Drew Goddard\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on FreeVee. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nA star-studded, charisma-packed murder-thriller told out of order, in the kind of layered \u201cand here\u2019s what was going on with this other character at the same time\u201d narrative that hangs plenty of Chekhovian guns on the wall for the final act, Bad Times at the El Royale is an underrated blast. Featuring Cynthia Erivo in a star-making role, Chris Hemsworth in a part that makes the most of his sex appeal, and plenty of other familiar names (Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Nick Offerman, Jeff Bridges) doing what they do, this one\u2019s a powder keg of a movie that assembles a motley crew of unrelated guests (or are they?) at a seedy motel, then keeps revealing secrets in a deliriously dizzy way as it all comes together. \u2014TR\n\nTwilight (1998)\n\nDirector: Robert Benton\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla.

    "body": "It had been reported Monday night when the Braves beat the Phillies in Game 2 of the NLDS, ending on a critical base-running play involving Bryce Harper, that Atlanta shortstop Orlando Arcia taunted about the Phillies' star in the clubhouse after the game.\n\nThat report wound up generating plenty of controversy.\n\nFox Sports' Jake Mintz, one of the two brothers that runs the popular Cespedes Family BBQ account, reported that Arcia had been celebrating after Atlanta's 5-4 win by saying \"Atta boy Harper\" in the Braves' clubhouse, jeering at the fact that Harper was doubled off on the basepaths after an outstanding catch by Michael Harris in center field and an impressive relay to get Harper at first to end the game.\n\nThe comments wound up coming back to bite the Braves two days later, with Harper homering twice \u2014 staring down Arcia after each \u2014 as he powered the Phillies to the 10-2 Game 3 win. When the Phillies beat the Braves in Game 4 to eliminate Atlanta and advance to the NLCS, players in the Philadelphia clubhouse celebrated by repeating, \"Atta boy Harper.\"\n\nWhile the comments became a spark for the Phillies, it also became a subject of controversy. Players, including the Blue Jays' Kevin Gausman, decried the situation as a mistake by Mintz to report the comments, which were said out loud in the locker room rather than said in an interview setting. Others defended the situation, saying that anything in the clubhouse is open to be reported on.\n\nMORE: Why Arcia's comments motivated Harper after NLDS Game 2\n\nBut perhaps the biggest backlash came from MLB Network's Alanna Rizzo, who blasted Mintz on \"High Heat\" for reporting on the incident. Following a BBWAA statement, Rizzo both publicly and privately apologized to Mintz for her reaction.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the controversy.\n\nBryce Harper Atta Boy controversy, explained\n\nIt all begins with the play. In Game 2, Harper led off the top of the ninth in a one-run game with a walk. J.T. Realmuto flew out to center for the first out, but on the next play, Nick Castellanos lifted a deep fly into right-center. It appeared it would be extra bases, and if Harper took off, he'd be able to score the tying run on the play.\n\nThe problem for the Phillies was that Harris made a leaping grab up against the wall to rob Castellanos of the hit. Harper had well since rounded second on his way to third, but the throw from Harris missed both cut-off men by second. Austin Riley, however, ran in and scooped the ball and made an impressive throw to Matt Olson to nab Harper and end the game.\n\nAfter the game, Mintz wrote a well-reported story on how the Braves pulled off the improbable comeback, coming back from down four runs at one point, to win the game, and deep in the article, wrote the following:\n\nKevin Pillar's young son, sporting a custom \"Money Mike\" headband, waddled over to his favorite center fielder for a fist bump. Third-string catcher Chadwick Tromp strutted by Harris' locker offering a congratulatory \"Mike is him!\" All while Braves shortstop Orlando Arcia cackled emphatically about Harper's misfortune, bellowing \"ha-ha, atta-boy, Harper!\" repeatedly as reporters circled the room.\n\nAs Mintz pointed out, he was not the only one to allude to the celebration from Arcia. The Washington Post's Chelsea Janes also wrote about it, saying that one of Harris' teammates was yelling, \"Atta boy Harper.\" The only difference was that Janes did not name the player.\n\nThe reporting of Arcia's comments proved to be divisive across the baseball community. Among the most prominent to call out Mintz was Rizzo. The \"High Heat\" co-host said she was irritated by \"bloggers or podcasters\" going into the clubhouse and \"ruining it for the rest of us\" when \"some jackoff comes in at the end of the season that gets a credential, God only knows why.\" She called the clubhouse \"a sacred place\" and defended the players who were upset by the reporting of Arcia's comments, before she called Mintz out by name.\n\nMORE: Every time Nick Castellanos has interrupted a somber moment with a home run\n\n\"First of all, this guy, Jake Mintz, that's not even a reporter,\" Rizzo said. \"That's taking away from true reporters and true journalists. Where were you on the random Tuesday in April in Cincinnati when this team was playing in Cincinnati? Where were you on a rain delay, and you have to sit in the press box for all of this time? It's ridiculous.\"\n\n\"And then some jackoff comes in at the end of the season that gets a credential, God only knows why. And the clubhouse is a sacred space.\" Alanna Rizzo went off on Jake Mintz's clubhouse reporting on MLBN's \"High Heat\" Thursday. pic.twitter.com/6dooqeLPnh \u2014 Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 12, 2023\n\nRizzo's comments immediately drew heat from the baseball journalism world, including from Janes, who posted a thread defending Mintz. Janes reported that cameras and recorders were recording, and that Arcia yelled the comments while they were recording and with more than a dozen reporters around. She said that reporters abstaining from writing on his comments would be akin to \"protecting players from themselves.\"\n\nShe also went on to say that what Arcia said wasn't a slur or hateful, and added the only reason anyone was concerned about it was because \"they know it would motivate Harper to beat [the Braves]. Which implies the Braves do not feel they can handle a motivated Bryce Harper and are willing to suggest that is why they lost the other day.\"\n\n\"I didn't say something sooner because I thought this was overblown,\" Janes continued. \"And frankly, I thought it wouldn't help. But I am genuinely disgusted by the way some media members are acting like a reporter was in the wrong for this. He wasn't.\n\n\"And if the Braves let this be the story of their series, that's on them. Win and it goes away. Period.\"\n\nThe incident elicited a response from the Baseball Writers Association of American (BBWAA), which defended Mintz, a BBWAA member.\n\n\"For the record, Jake is a BBWAA member in good standing and has earned the right to be credentialed through his hard work and quality baseball coverage,\" the BBWAA wrote in the statement. \"To assert otherwise, in vulgar terms, is both unprofessional and unacceptable. The BBWAA is deeply troubled that the league's own network would permit the disparaging of one of our members in this fashion. Scrutinizing our work is part of the territory but comments such as these should have no place on MLBN.\"\n\nFollowing the backlash to her comments, Rizzo apologized on \"High Heat\" to Mintz and the BBWAA. She said her comments were \"completely inappropriate, it was inaccurate and it was beyond unprofessional. I got caught up in the heat of the moment.\"\n\n\"What I said was completely off base and I've had an interesting 24 hours and I've learned a lot more and I apologize to Jake. I talked to him already, I apologized to him privately and I also apologize to him publicly,\" Rizzo said. \"They do a good job in the clubhouse and I was completely inaccurate in my assessment of what went down there.\"\n\nAlanna Rizzo gave \"a very heartfelt apology to Jake Mintz and the entire BBWAA\" pic.twitter.com/rT9tjSWLY3 \u2014 Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 13, 2023\n\nMintz, though calling her initial comments \"incredibly hurtful/uncalled for,\" wrote on X saying that he was \"glad she apologized,\" and asked people not to toss hate to her.\n\n\"Thanks to all the reporters, journos, baseball twitter weirdos, acquaintances and friends who had my back over the last 48 hours,\" Mintz wrote. \"And also, of course, the BBWAA. Community feels good, humbled to be a part of this one. Now, let's enjoy some ball.\""

    "body": "Part of / The best entertainment of 2023\n\nNetflix\u2019s first Castlevania animated series excelled by balancing its quiet, beautifully performed moments of human drama with explosive and artful action set pieces dazzling enough to evoke the feeling of playing Konami\u2019s classic side-scroller for the first time. Despite the first show\u2019s strengths, its regular issues with pacing and effectively cultivating characters from season to season made the idea of Netflix keeping the vampiric daddy issues ball rolling with Castlevania: Nocturne \u2014 a new spinoff series from executive producer Clive Bradley and co-directors Sam Deats and Adam Deats \u2014 a dubious one.\n\nNocturne both looks and feels a lot like its predecessor in terms of its focus on a tortured scion waging war against machiavellian, bloodsucking ghouls who fancy themselves undead gods who walk among mortal livestock. But while Nocturne could have easily settled and coasted on classic Castlevania vibes, the new show steps its game up considerably by using the franchise\u2019s iconic lore to challenge your understanding of what it truly means to fight for freedom, equality, and fraternity.\n\nSet in the late 18th century during the thick of the French Revolution, Castlevania: Nocturne picks up hundreds of years after the events of Netflix\u2019s first Castlevania series as demon slayer Richter Belmont (Edward Bluemel) makes his way to France in search of vengeance and vampires. Like his distant holy whip-wielding ancestor Trevor, Richter\u2019s innate talents for magic make him perfectly suited for getting into the family business, and being raised by his formidable warrior mother Julia (Sophie Skelton) instills in him a profound sense of pride in the work they do.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nTogether, Richter\u2019s raw potential and Julia\u2019s tutelage make him uniquely powerful even from a young age. But despite all of Julia\u2019s skill with her family\u2019s deadly heirloom, Castlevania: Nocturne\u2019s world is one teeming with vampires even centuries after Dracula has seemingly been destroyed, and the series opens at a devastating moment in Richter\u2019s past that leaves him orphaned and unable to access his magic.\n\nThough Nocturne takes place in the same continuity as the previous Castlevania show, it also uses major pieces of lore from Konami\u2019s Castlevania: Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night games to tell a riveting story about the inherent hypocrisies baked into the historic record of colonial nations embracing democratic revolution.\n\nHere, the French Revolution isn\u2019t just a transformative period of social unrest between moneyed elites and impoverished peasants fed up with their subjugation. It\u2019s a war between undead ghouls like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson) manipulating mortals from the shadows, selfish humans like a power-hungry Abbot (\u200b\u200bRichard Dormer), and agitators like summoner Maria (Pixie) who want to dismantle the entire oppressive system of power that makes France a formidable global presence.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nNarratively, Nocturne\u2019s focus on another brooding Belmont and its depiction of late-18th-century France as a country overrun by literally vampiric aristocrats drunk on the promise of a new messiah make the new series feel true to the essence of Castlevania. What makes Nocturne\u2019s deep dive into this alternate history a worthwhile watch, though, is the way it presents France not just as a crumbling monarchy in the throes of a heroic social uprising but also as a colonial nation whose pivot to democracy at home can\u2019t be divorced from its history of committing unfathomable atrocities abroad.\n\nNocturne reworks a number of Castlevania\u2019s classic supporting characters like Maria \u2014 who fights using reimagined versions of the Four Sacred Beasts \u2014 and empathic singer Edouard (Sydney James Harcourt) to brilliant effect. But out of all the show\u2019s old but new faces, ferrokinetic Vodoun practitioner Annette (Thuso Mbedu) stands out because of how strongly the show introduces her as a woman whose Haitian identity is what makes her able to understand the situation over in France with an exacting kind of clarity.\n\nIt\u2019s through Annette and the show\u2019s exploration of Afro Caribbean syncretism that Nocturne expands the boundaries of Castlevania\u2019s magical mythology, which is touched on heavily throughout the season\u2019s eight episodes. Small nods to the video games and gnarly beheadings abound, particularly in the Powerhouse Animation-produced show\u2019s bigger hyperkinetic brawls between its heroes and hordes of horrific creatures.\n\nBut in all the bloodshed, Nocturne still finds the time to make its characters (and by extension, you) think about what it means to slaughter technically innocent people for a genuinely noble cause. That beat isn\u2019t entirely original, and Nocturne\u2019s mindful about leaning on it too hard as it begins to weave Annette and Edouard\u2019s stories together with Richter and Maria\u2019s in France. Still, it creates a resonance between the show\u2019s action and the concepts it\u2019s tackling that makes the season as a whole work beautifully.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nOccasionally, there are moments where the fluid dreaminess of Nocturne\u2019s overall art direction butts up against the show\u2019s application of 3D animation to make certain pivotal moments pop. It can be jarring when traditionally animated characters who were just popping in and out of view using tricks of the eye suddenly turn to the camera with deeper faces accented by flat shadows that weren\u2019t there a second before.\n\nAs strong and different as the season starts, by its last two episodes, Nocturne does start to feel a bit like it\u2019s rehashing moments from the first show \u2014 if not in exact form, then in terms of how neatly it brings its plotlines to a close. None of that\u2019s enough to keep the show from hitting all the right notes, however, and by the time you hit the finale, there\u2019s a solid chance you\u2019ll already be hoping for more."

    "body": "Erik ten Hag smiles when asked if Andr\u00e9 Onana can be the \u201cholding midfielder\u201d for Manchester United described in Uefa\u2019s technical report of the goalkeeper\u2019s display for Internazionale in May\u2019s Champions League final.\n\n\u201cFirst the job of a keeper is to save, is to [guard] his goal, that\u2019s his main job and don\u2019t forget this,\u201d says United\u2019s manager. \u201cBut, yeah, he is a keeper who we can use as an extra player and if we are developing [more] he can be more progressive and even higher up the pitch \u2013 an extra player, so that\u2019s an advantage.\u201d\n\nOnana\u2019s last game for the Italian club was the 1-0 defeat by Manchester City in Istanbul as United\u2019s crosstown rivals claimed a first Champions League and so clinched the treble. Yet if he has recent experience of facing Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, the 27-year-old will be a derby debutant against City in Sunday\u2019s 191st edition of the local squabble that will attract a global audience of millions.\n\nUefa\u2019s description of Onana intrigues because it suggests that what Guardiola introduced to the domestic game \u2013 a No 1 in Ederson who performs as a de facto extra defender to maintain fluidity along the backline \u2013 has evolved further. The goalkeeper was so advanced as to be a No 6 (rather than, the technical report posited, a \u201csweeper-keeper\u201d) who can take up residence in the middle third of his half as his team pushes deep into enemy territory.\n\nOnana did so against City for Internazionale but has this encounter with the champions come too soon for him to function as \u201cthe extra man\u201d Ten Hag identifies? \u201cIt also depends on the opposition, how strong is the press, for instance, and how good is the team around him,\u201d the United manager says.\n\n\u201cSo if it\u2019s possible \u2013 in my philosophy he has to do it every game [but] it is not always possible, so you have to adapt and this what I make clear. Even if you\u2019re not playing well, if the team is not playing well, or you\u2019re not playing to the standards you expect, you still have to win \u2013 so find a way to win, be pragmatic.\u201d\n\nUnited have been so of late, claiming victories over Sheffield United, Brentford and FC Copenhagen in their last three matches. But Ten Hag\u2019s \u201cdepends on the opposition\u201d and \u201chow good is the team around him\u201d comments sound like hints. In contrast to Inter\u2019s Simone Inzaghi, the United manager may harbour doubts about deploying Onana high up the pitch against City.\n\nThe Dutchman is still building his team and may be wary of the uneven form of United\u2019s new keeper. Bought for \u00a347.2m, Onana arrived on a ticket of being a high-grade shot-stopper, technically impressive too with the ball at his feet. But until impressing against Brentford and Copenhagen, Onana had bombed, costing United goals and points.\n\n\u201cCertain things [here] are different,\u201d shrugs Ten Hag when asked why the No 1 is taking time to settle in England. \u201cOK it is 11-v-11, and it is about attacking, defending, transition. But there is more: the approach to the game, the speed of the game, the intensity. The varieties in styles. So there is absolutely a difference and players need to adjust, need time to do so.\u201d\n\nLast season\u2019s derby at Old Trafford ended in a 2-1 win for United. Bruno Fernandes\u2019s equaliser was controversial with Marcus Rashford offside but not so the goal was chalked off as he had not touched the ball. So far this term the captain has scored two goals in 12 United appearances and Ten Hag has no doubt he can be a major factor in Sunday\u2019s showdown.\n\n\u201cIf he does [score] again, I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d the manager says. \u201cBruno is an [effective] player when we have a lot of the ball. Then he is at his best. And there are games against top teams when you have less of the ball. So then it is about taking benefit from [any attacking] moments and for the rest you have to work hard for the team. And to get a result because that is the most important, that the team is winning.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "Most season-long fantasy leagues are entering their final week of the regular season in Week 14, and if your team isn't going to qualify for the postseason, then welcome to the DFS side of things, where every week is a new season and every DraftKings lineup can be the one that changes your life.\n\nIn this world, we don't have to sweat the injury reports, make difficult trades, or even concern ourselves with bad matchups. Instead, we get to enjoy each week for what it is -- a new opportunity. Whether it's your first time or your 200th time, there's something to keep us all coming back. Without further ado, welcome to our DraftKings lineup for Week 14.\n\nBefore we break down all of our picks, here are the most notable scoring rules for DraftKings contests: Full-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, three-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\n\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\n\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nDraftKings Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\n\nSunday main slate, $50,000 budget\n\nQB Justin Fields, Bears vs. Lions ($6,800). The Lions might have control over the NFC North, but their defense is losing steam as the season progresses. Detroit appeared well on their way to a dominant victory over New Orleans until they let the corpse of the 2023 Saints march back into it, nearly taking a lead (which is alarming with this version of Derek Carr leading the charge). Fields recently had success against the divisional foe, rushing for 104 yards and tossing a touchdown in Week 11. The dual-threat QB should be in line for a great day at home.\n\nRB Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks ($9,200). Sometimes, you just have to splurge and live a little. Fantasy's best RB has been a little rich for us all season, but now is the time to strike. The 49ers are coming off an emotional win over the Eagles after stomping the Seahawks on Thanksgiving. They are trying to track down the top spot in the NFC and will continue to lean on their stars. McCaffrey just rushed over 100 yards and two touchdowns against this same defense two weeks ago, and his floor remains at the penthouse with a ceiling that stretches to the moon -- the place we hope to be going with him in the lineup.\n\nWEEK 14 DFS: FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\n\nRB Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers ($8,200). The Saints have a QB problem and the offense is stuck in quicksand more often than not. Derek Carr will likely be out with a concussion, leaving Jameis Winston to start. The Winston experience is certainly not for the faint of heart, but it's undoubtedly exciting. Kamara remains a fixture in the offense as arguably the team's top runner and receiver, thanks to his work as a security blanket for whichever QB is under center. The Panthers remain terrible at defending RBs, giving Kamara the perfect landing spot to build on what was a solid Week 13. We can pencil him in for at least 100 total yards and a touchdown.\n\nWR DJ Moore, Bears vs. Lions ($6,500). Fields' chemistry with Moore is fairly obvious by now. The connection continues to shine with each passing week, totaling 210 yards over the past two games in addition to scoring a TD. We're especially fond of the 22 targets with a leaky secondary once again on tap. Moore cooked the Lions to the tune of almost 23 fantasy points in Week 12, and being well-rested off the bye means we're likely to see more of the same.\n\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWR Drake London, Falcons vs. Buccaneers ($4,600). When we see the Buccaneers on the schedule, we immediately look to see what WR1 is going to have a big day. It wasn't the greatest feeling in the world seeing the Falcons this week, but we're confident in London's ability to make this pick worth our while. He hauled in six-of-seven targets for 54 yards and almost added a score in Week 7 against Tampa, indicating history is on our side here. Because we splurged for McCaffrey and Kamara, we had to sacrifice salary elsewhere, and London is a high-upside option even in an offense that doesn't throw the ball with efficiency.\n\nWR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks @ 49ers ($4,100). Is a takeover underway in the Seahawks offense? Smith-Njigba is coming off a game against the Cowboys that saw him collect seven-of-11 targets for 62 yards. It's a step up from a disappointing outing against San Francisco, but Tyler Lockett's involvement seems to be lessening as of late with the rookie stepping up. It wasn't a great day for the Seattle offense on Thanksgiving against the Niners, but the Seahawks should put up a better effort against a divisional opponent they know so well. If they're trailing, JSN should see action with a negative game script.\n\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nTE Brevin Jordan, Texans @ Jets ($3,100). Jordan was a great streaming option and fill-in for the crowd that lost Dalton Schultz (hamstring) on Sunday, hauling in three-of-four targets for 64 yards against the Broncos. If Schultz is out again, Jordan is a serviceable option that has touchdown upside against a reeling Jets team that is busy booking vacations or plotting how to find themselves on a different roster in 2024. If Schultz does play, we'll pivot to the Jets' Tyler Conklin, who is $100 less and has plenty of opportunity in an even better matchup.\n\nFLEX WR Jameson Williams, Lions @ Bears ($3,500). As we come down to the last remaining dollars of our Week 14 budget, we need to take some swings and hope that the wind blows in our direction. What better way to approach this than with a pick from the game in the Windy City? Williams typically has around three chances a game to make a big play, something he's delivered on in two of the past three weeks -- including against the Bears two weeks ago. He's the perfect boom-or-bust target in a game that could feature a lot of points like it did last time.\n\nDEF Texans @ Jets ($4,000). We're right back to exploiting the Jets' offense since it's one of the few that we can trust to score fewer than 10 points every week.

    "body": "ChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was \u201cnot consistently candid in his communications\u201d with the board of directors.\n\n\u201cThe board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\u201d the artificial intelligence company said in a statement.\n\nIn the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley\u2019s sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry\u2019s future.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said, while it searches for a permanent replacement.\n\nThe announcement also said another OpenAI co-founder and top executive, Greg Brockman, the board\u2019s chairman, would step down from that role but remain at the company, where he serves as president. But later on X, formerly Twitter, Brockman posted a message he sent to OpenAI employees in which he wrote, \u201cbased on today\u2019s news, i quit.\u201d\n\nIn another X post on Friday night, Brockman said Altman was asked to join a video meeting at noon Friday with the company\u2019s board members, minus Brockman, during which OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever informed Altman he was being fired.\n\n\u201cSam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,\u201d Brockman wrote, adding that he was informed of his removal from the board in a separate call with Sutskever a short time later.\n\nOpenAI declined to answer questions on what Altman\u2019s alleged lack of candor was about. The statement said his behavior was hindering the board\u2019s ability to exercise its responsibilities.\n\nAltman posted Friday on X: \u201ci loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nAltman helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research laboratory in 2015. But it was ChatGPT\u2019s explosion into public consciousness that thrust Altman into the spotlight as a face of generative AI \u2014 technology that can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. On a world tour this year, he was mobbed by a crowd of adoring fans at an event in London.\n\nHe\u2019s sat with multiple heads of state to discuss AI\u2019s potential and perils. Just Thursday, he took part in a CEO summit at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, where OpenAI is based.\n\nHe predicted AI will prove to be \u201cthe greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d He also acknowledged the need for guardrails, calling attention to the existential dangers future AI could pose.\n\nSome computer scientists have criticized that focus on far-off risks as distracting from the real-world limitations and harms of current AI products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\n\nThe company said its board consists of OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and three non-employees: Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s key business partner, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems, said that the transition won\u2019t affect its relationship.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,\u201d said an emailed Microsoft statement.\n\nWhile not trained as an AI engineer, Altman, now 38, has been seen as a Silicon Valley wunderkind since his early 20s. He was recruited in 2014 to take lead of the startup incubator YCombinator.\n\n\u201cSam is one of the smartest people I know, and understands startups better than perhaps anyone I know, including myself,\u201d read YCombinator co-founder Paul Graham\u2019s 2014 announcement that Altman would become its president. Graham said at the time that Altman was \u201cone of those rare people who manage to be both fearsomely effective and yet fundamentally benevolent.\u201d\n\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d\n\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT large language model for mimicking human writing. Around the same time, Musk, who had co-chaired its board with Altman, resigned from the board in a move that OpenAI said would eliminate a \u201cpotential future conflict for Elon\u201d due to Tesla\u2019s work on building self-driving systems.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s board has preserved its nonprofit governance structure, the startup it oversees has increasingly sought to capitalize on its technology by tailoring its popular chatbot to business customers.\n\nAt its first developer conference last week, Altman was the main speaker showcasing a vision for a future of AI agents that could help people with a variety of tasks. Days later, he announced the company would have to pause new subscriptions to its premium version of ChatGPT because it had exceeded capacity.\n\nAltman\u2019s exit \u201cis indeed shocking as he has been the face of\u201d generative AI technology, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.\n\nHe said OpenAI still has a \u201cdeep bench of technical leaders\u201d but its next executives will have to steer it through the challenges of scaling the business and meeting the expectations of regulators and society.\n\nForrester analyst Rowan Curran speculated that Altman\u2019s departure, \u201cwhile sudden,\u201d did not likely reflect deeper business problems.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be a case of an executive transition that was about issues with the individual in question, and not with the underlying technology or business,\u201d Curran said.\n\nAltman has a number of possible next steps. Even while running OpenAI, he placed large bets on several other ambitious projects.\n\nAmong them are Helion Energy, for developing fusion reactors that could produce prodigious amounts of energy from the hydrogen in seawater, and Retro Biosciences, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan using biotechnology. Altman also co-founded Worldcoin, a biometric and cryptocurrency project that\u2019s been scanning people\u2019s eyeballs with the goal of creating a vast digital identity and financial network.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press business writers Haleluya Hadero in New York, Kelvin Chan in London and Michael Liedtke and David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report."

    "body": "In perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company\u2019s board after an apparent vote of no confidence. Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman\u2019s \u201cdeparture follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?! Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.\n\n1. Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?\n\nBased on the board\u2019s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. \u201cNot consistently candid\u201d is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Altman \u2014 and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned \u2014 wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like. It\u2019s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.\n\nBut what kind of deal would be big and dangerous enough for a summary dismissal of the CEO and famous face of the company? The man was onstage two weeks ago; I just talked with him! What could have happened since then?\n\nFew would be shocked if Microsoft, which is deeply, deeply embedded in OpenAI as an investor and customer, is a factor here. Could Altman have been working with \u2014 or against \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s patron in secret? If Altman wanted to kill the golden goose by going independent, that might have activated the board\u2019s fiduciary or otherwise statutory duty. On the other hand, if he was negotiating some other deal, like an acquisition or deeper and more exclusive integration, it could also have caused the board to bristle, either at the idea itself or at being excluded.\n\nBut if Microsoft was as shocked as the rest of us, as one report has it, it could hardly be the kind of high-stakes conspiracy some seem to be hoping for. But one must assume that Microsoft would say that either way. Even if they\u2019d been working with Altman on some kind of secret plan, they can truthfully say they were surprised by his firing. (And they \u201cremain committed to our partnership.\u201d)\n\n2. Do they disagree on long-term strategy?\n\nDespite being the hottest tech company in the world right now and everyone talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI isn\u2019t exactly a sound business. It\u2019s shoveling money into the furnace as fast as it can by serving, by all accounts, a fantastically expensive product at bargain-bin prices.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability. Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies?\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem so likely. The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis. Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.\n\n3. Do the numbers not add up?\n\nOn the other hand, could OpenAI be losing even more money than Altman admitted or projected? It seems impossible, but the costs of running this operation have no precedent, nor really does the operation itself.\n\nOr what if, and again this is purely speculation, Altman has been secretly pursuing an internal project, perhaps at significant cost, against the advice of the board and without the necessary safety measures that probably should accompany such research? It sounds a little wild, but firing your CEO like this is also a little wild.\n\nSome kind of major mismatch in the financial department could be cause for dismissal, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what Altman could have kept from the board and CTO that would be so damning.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with. With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power. One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world\u2019s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them. But one can never be sure.\n\n4. Could it be a major security or privacy incident?\n\nThe idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. OpenAI subsequently stopped allowing new signups. If there was a serious security problem in its biggest product and Altman downplayed it, that would obviously create distrust with the board.\n\nThere is also the potential for misuse at scale with the enormous amount of personal data that travels through OpenAI\u2019s APIs and services.\n\nWorking against this theory is the fact that CTO Mira Murati was just elevated to interim CEO in Altman\u2019s place. It seems unlikely that anything security-related would go through the CEO and not the CTO, or that the two would be at odds to the point where one could be fired like this and the other swapped in to clean up the mess. As the board\u2019s statement notes, Murati is in charge of product and safety, among other things. Any significant snafu in that department would reflect on her, as well as Altman.\n\n5. Perhaps a difference of AI ethics or philosophy?\n\nAltman is a proud techno-optimist, and often speaks fondly of the possibilities of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a theoretical software system that achieves human-like intellect and versatility.\n\nThe board\u2019s statement pointedly includes that \u201cOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity\u201d and that new leadership was necessary. It\u2019s possible that Sam\u2019s zeal for AGI, even absent a secret project or agreement, led to a major rift between him and the board.\n\nIt\u2019s been obvious to all that Altman took the company in a much more corporate direction from its origins, changing its legal status and aggressively pursuing enterprise and consumer applications. That doesn\u2019t sound a lot like the \u201cmission\u201d the board wants to advance. Then again, this shift didn\u2019t happen today, and it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a plausible reason for abruptly firing the CEO and a few others on a beautiful fall Friday afternoon.\n\n6. What about IP and legal liability?\n\nAltman told me at OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day earlier this month that the company doesn\u2019t want to incur any copyright problems by using (as I had asked about) datasets of pirated books. But a lot of research I\u2019ve been reading contradicts that, as does pretty much every AI data scientist I talk to. It\u2019s exceedingly hard to imagine that OpenAI built GPT-3 with the copyrighted books database (as seems to be the case) but not GPT-4 or succeeding models. (I was going to write this up next week, so thanks OpenAI board for eating my lunch.)\n\nIf you were the board and facing the mounting accusations that your product was built on a dataset that includes thousands or millions of copyrighted works \u2014 and your CEO had systematically downplayed the potential liability there \u2014 how would you feel? I\u2019d feel very hurt.\n\nBut again, if copyright liability was the reason, it seems unlikely that the board would promote the CTO. Presumably, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Science Officer Ilya Sutskever would also have been in the know, and he\u2019s still on the board.\n\n7. Did CTO Mira Murati launch a coup?\n\nProbably not \u2014 she seems cool, and anyway what CTO wants to be CEO? Mira, answer my email!\n\n8. Was it a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d?\n\nWhen someone is kicked out in a hurry, it\u2019s not uncommon that there was some kind of unprofessional behavior in the workplace. Some CEOs get a pass on things like having kids with direct reports, but not all.\n\nAltman also has three siblings, and his younger sister Annie has publicly accused him of abuse. We have no way of evaluating these allegations, which involve private matters.\n\nOur read on the board\u2019s language in dismissing Altman, however, is that it was not a legal or personal problem that provoked the action, but a professional or business one.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t know the full truth on this for a long time, as the characters in the drama are likely to be NDA\u2019ed up. Per various whispers and leaks, an all-hands meeting about the situation this afternoon didn\u2019t produce any revelations beyond banal reassurances that the company is fine and they\u2019ll get a fresh CEO soon. Expect to hear a lot of rumors before we hear the real thing."

    "body": "Hey, folks, welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s regular newsletter that recaps the past few days in tech. AI stole the headlines once again, with tech giants from Google to X (formerly Twitter) heading off against OpenAI for chatbot supremacy. But plenty happened besides.\n\nIn this edition of WiR, we cover Google faking a demo of its new AI model (and giving out offensive notebooks to Black summit attendees), defense startup Anduril unveiling a fighter jet weapon, the continued fallout from the 23andMe hack, and the release of the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. Also on the roster are stories about patient scans and health records spilling online, Meta\u2019s new AI-powered image generator, Spotify cutting jobs and an autonomous truck startup leaving the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to get to, so we won\u2019t delay. But first, a reminder to sign up here to receive WiR in your inbox every Saturday if you haven\u2019t already done so.\n\nMost read\n\nAI, faked: Google unveiled a new flagship AI model this week called Gemini. But it didn\u2019t release the full model, Gemini Ultra \u2014 only a \u201clite\u201d version called Gemini Pro. In a press briefing and blog posts, Google touted Gemini\u2019s coding capabilities and multimodal prowess, claiming that the model can understand images, audio and videos just as well as text. But Gemini Pro \u2014 which is strictly text-in, text-out \u2014 has proven to be mistake-prone. And in a worse look for Google, the company was caught faking a Gemini demo by tuning text prompts with still images off camera.\n\nOffensive notebooks: In another Google PR blunder, people who attended the company\u2019s K&I Black Summit in August were given third-party notebooks containing highly insensitive language. My colleague Dominic-Madori writes that the inside of the notebooks were printed with the phrase \u201cI was just cotton the moment, but I came back to take your notes\u201d (emphasis ours). It goes without saying that this wouldn\u2019t have been well received by the mostly Black audience in attendance; Google has pledged to \u201cavoid similar situations as [it engages] with [merchandise] vendors going forward.\u201d\n\nAnduril\u2019s new weapon: Anduril, the controversial defense company co-founded by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, has developed a new product designed to take on the proliferation of low-cost, high-powered aerial threats. Dubbed Roadrunner, the modular, twin-jet-powered autonomous vertical take-off and landing air vehicle \u2014 one version of which is capable of carrying a warhead \u2014 can take off, follow and destroy targets or, if there\u2019s no need to intercept the target, autonomously maneuver back to base for refueling and reuse.\n\nMore 23andMe victims: Last Friday, genetic testing company 23andMe announced that hackers managed to access the personal data of 0.1% of customers, or about 14,000 individuals. But the company didn\u2019t initially say how many other users might\u2019ve been impacted by the breach, which 23andMe first disclosed in October. A lot, as it turns out \u2014 6.9 million people had their names, birth years, relationship labels, the percentage of DNA they share with relatives, ancestry reports and self-reported locations exposed.\n\nGrand Theft Auto goes viral: In just 22 hours, the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI racked up 85 million views \u2014 breaking a MrBeast video\u2019s record for most YouTube views in 24 hours. The excitement for Grand Theft Auto VI is a decade in the making; the previous entry in Rockstar Games\u2019 long-running franchise, Grand Theft Auto V, remains the second-best-selling video game of all time, falling short only of Minecraft.\n\nPatient records leak: Thousands of exposed servers are spilling the medical records and personal health information of millions of patients due to security weaknesses in a decades\u2019 old industry standard designed for storing and sharing medical images. This standard, known as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), is the internationally recognized format for medical imaging. But as discovered by Aplite, a Germany-based cybersecurity consultancy, security shortcomings in DICOM mean many medical facilities have unintentionally made private data accessible to the open web.\n\nMeta generates images: Not to be outdone by Google\u2019s Gemini launch, Meta rolled out a new, stand-alone generative AI experience on the web, Imagine with Meta AI, that allows users to create images by describing them in natural language. Similar to OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, Imagine with Meta AI, which is powered by Meta\u2019s existing Emu image-generation model, creates high-resolution images from text prompts.\n\nSpotify makes cuts: Spotify is eliminating about 1,500 jobs, or roughly 17% of its workforce, in its third round of layoffs this year as the music streaming giant looks to become \u201cboth productive and efficient.\u201d In a note to employees Monday, Spotify founder and chief executive Daniel Ek \u2014 citing slow economic growth and rising capital costs \u2014 said right-sizing the workforce is crucial for the company to face the \u201cchallenges ahead.\u201d\n\nTuSimple exits: When TuSimple went public in 2021, it was flying high as the leading self-driving trucks developer in the U.S. Now \u2014 after a string of internal controversies and the loss of a critical partnership with truck manufacturer Navistar \u2014 TuSimple is exiting the U.S. altogether. TuSimple said in a regulatory filing Monday that it\u2019s laying off the majority of its U.S. workforce and selling assets here as it exits the country for Asia.\n\nZestMoney shuts down: ZestMoney \u2014 a buy now, pay later startup whose ability to underwrite small-ticket loans to first-time internet customers attracted many high-profile investors, including Goldman Sachs \u2014 is shutting down following unsuccessful efforts to find a buyer. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup employed about 150 people at peak and raised more than $130 million over its eight-year journey.\n\nAudio\n\nTechCrunch\u2019s roster of podcast episodes keeps growing \u2014 just in time for weekend listening.\n\nEquity featured a throwback conversation from TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, when Alex sat down with Serhii Bohoslovskyi, the founder of a no-code app builder, Trible, that helps people construct online courses. The pair caught up on the state of the creator economy, the use of no-code tooling today (and how it\u2019s received by nontechnical creators) and the security of startups with roots in Ukraine.\n\nOver on Found, the crew talked to David Rogier, the CEO and founder of MasterClass, a streaming platform where you can learn from the world\u2019s experts on a range of topics. Before Rogier launched MasterClass, he worked as a VC, and \u2014 through his connections \u2014 he received a $500,000 seed round before he even had an idea for a company.\n\nAnd on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn interviewed David Pakman, managing partner and head of venture investments at CoinFund. Before CoinFund, David spent 14 years at the venture capital firm Venrock. He also led the Series A and B rounds at Dollar Shave Club, which was acquired by Unilever for $1 billion. And, in 1991, David co-created Apple Music when he was part of Apple\u2019s system software product marketing group.\n\nTechCrunch+\n\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber. If you\u2019re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week:\n\nBitcoin surge: Jacquelyn writes about Bitcoin\u2019s rapid-fire ascent to $44,000, which came on the back of roughly 25% gains in the last week. Her piece for TC+ explores what\u2019s driving Bitcoin\u2019s price ascent and similar value gains among other tokens \u2014 and whether the good vibes continue into the new year.\n\nTo swap, or not to swap: Tim reports on how consumer EV battery swapping could usher in freedom for a wide range of people, allowing them to participate in the EV transition in ways that traditional built-in batteries don\u2019t. The challenge is making the unit economics work.\n\nCoinbase and Robin and the future of fintech: Investors are betting that consumer trading of equity and crypto is rebounding and are consequently pushing the value of some former startups higher, Alex writes. That could spell good news for startups offering consumer trading services directly \u2014 or indirectly, for that matter."

    "body": "Following a content moderation warning from European Union regulators earlier this week, Meta has published an overview of how its responding to risks on its social media platforms stemming from the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIts blog post covers what it frames as \u201congoing efforts\u201d, with some existing policies and tools for users rehashed. But the company confirms it\u2019s made some changes in light of fast moving events in Israel and Gaza.\n\nThese include what it says is a temporary expansion of its Violence and Incitement policy in order to prioritize the safety of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas.\n\nUnder this change Meta says it will be removing content that \u201cclearly identifies hostages when we\u2019re made aware of it, even if it\u2019s being done to condemn or raise awareness of their situation\u201d. \u201cWe are allowing content with blurred images of the victims but, in line with standards established by the Geneva Convention, we will prioritize the safety and privacy of kidnapping victims if we are unsure or unable to make a clear assessment,\u201d it added.\n\nMeta also says it\u2019s prioritizing checks on livestreaming functions on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 including watching for any attempts by Hamas to use the tools to broadcast footage of captured Israelis or other hostages.\n\nIn a particularly disturbing report on Israeli media this week, which was widely recirculated on social media, a girl recounted how she and her family had learnt about the death of her grandmother after Hamas militants had uploaded a video of her dead body to Facebook, apparently using her own mobile phone to post the graphic content to the dead woman\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the immediacy of Live brings unique challenges, so we have restrictions in place on the use of Live for people who have previously violated certain policies. We\u2019re prioritizing livestream reports related to this crisis, above and beyond our existing prioritization of Live videos,\u201d Meta wrote, highlighting measure it took in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch attacks in New Zealand when a single shooter livestreamed a killing spree that targeted two mosques on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware of Hamas\u2019 threats to broadcast footage of the hostages and we\u2019re taking these threats extremely seriously. Our teams are monitoring this closely, and would swiftly remove any such content (and the accounts behind it), banking the content in our systems to prevent copies being re-shared,\u201d it added.\n\nOther steps taken by Meta to respond to the situation in Israel and Gaza include making it less likely that its systems will actively recommend potentially violating or borderline content and to reduce the visibility of potentially offensive comments; and applying hashtag blocking to render certain terms related to the conflict non-searchable on its platforms. Its blog post does not specify which hashtags Meta is blocking in relation to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMeta\u2019s blog post also says it established a special operations center staffed with experts, including Arabic and Hebrew speakers, to dial up its ability to quickly respond to content report.\n\nIt also says it\u2019s taking feedback from local partners (such as NGOs) on emerging risks \u2014 and claiming to be \u201cmoving quickly to address them\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the three days following October 7, we removed or marked as disturbing more than 795,000 pieces of content for violating these policies in Hebrew and Arabic,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAs compared to the two months prior, in the three days following October 7, we have removed seven times as many pieces of content on a daily basis for violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy in Hebrew and Arabic alone.\u201d\n\nIn light of the dialled up attention on and concern about the situation, Meta says it\u2019s possible non-violating content may be removed \u201cin error\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo mitigate this, for some violations we are temporarily removing content without strikes, meaning these content removals won\u2019t cause accounts to be disabled,\u201d it notes. \u201cWe also continue to provide tools for users to appeal our decisions if they think we made a mistake.\u201d\n\nCompliance with the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) kicked in for Meta in August as the owner of a so-called very large online platform (VLOP).\n\nThe Commission designated 19 VLOPs back in April \u2014 including Meta owned Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe designation puts obligations on VLOPs to respond diligently to reports of illegal content, as well as clearly communicate their T&Cs to users and properly enforce their terms. But it also ranges more widely \u2014 requiring these larger platforms to take steps to identify and mitigate systemic risks such as disinformation.\n\nThe regulation also contains a \u201ccrisis response\u201d mechanism which the Commission may adopt on VLOPs in situations where use of their platforms could contribute to serious threats such as war. Although this aspect of the regulation won\u2019t start operating until early next year (Feburary 17) as it requires an advisory body, called the European Board for Digital Services, to be operational so it can recommend the Commission to adopt a crisis response mechanism (and the set up of the Board is waiting on Member States to establish national Digital Services Coordinators, aka the bodies that will oversee DSA compliance for non-VLOPs).\n\nPenalties for failing to comply with the pan-EU regulation can reach as high as 6% of global annual turnover \u2014 which, in Meta\u2019s case, could run to multiple billions.\n\nThe social media giant is not alone in being warned by the bloc over content concerns attached to the Israel-Hamas war: Elon Musk\u2019s X has been singled out for even greater attention here \u2014 with the bloc issuing both an \u201curgent\u201d warning earlier this week and following that with a formal request for information about its compliance approach.\n\nTikTok has also received a warning from the EU about DSA content risks related to the conflict.\n\nThis report was updated with details about the operational timeline for the DSA crisis response mechanism coming into operation"

    "body": "In the occupied Palestinian territories, there are cameras everywhere. In Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem, residents say cameras were installed by Israeli police up and down their streets, peering into their homes. One resident named Sara said she and her family \u201ccould be detected as if the cameras were just in our house \u2026 we couldn\u2019t feel at home in our own house and had to be fully dressed all the time.\u201d\n\nSurveillance cameras now cover the Damascus Gate, the main entrance into the old city of Jerusalem and one of the only public areas for Palestinians to gather socially and hold demonstrations. It\u2019s at that gate that \u201cPalestinians are being watched and assessed at all times\u201d, according to an Amnesty International report, Automated Apartheid. These cameras have created a chilling effect on not just the ability to protest but also on the daily lives of Palestinians who live under occupation, according to Amnesty investigators. The organization had previously concluded that Israel has established a system of apartheid against Palestinians.\n\nAmong the vendors behind these surveillance cameras is a company that has been accused of aiding what the US has categorized as a genocide: Hikvision. Based in Hangzhou, China, the company is one of the world\u2019s largest makers of video surveillance equipment. Already infamous among international human rights groups, it has been blacklisted by the US and identified by the UK as a security threat for being complicit in China\u2019s repression of the Uyghur ethnic minority.\n\nThe presence of Hikvision cameras in the West Bank was first revealed in the May report by Amnesty, which documented facial-recognition and surveillance-camera technology that the human rights organization concluded is being used to reinforce Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank in an act of \u201cdigital repression\u201d. Amnesty surveyed two West Bank neighborhoods, East Jerusalem and Hebron, where Israeli settlers have set up homes in violation of international law, and found that facial-recognition systems \u201care providing the Israeli authorities with powerful new tools for curbing freedom of movement \u2026 adding further layers of technological sophistication to the system of apartheid that Israel is imposing on Palestinians\u201d.\n\nThe Amnesty report identified dozens of Hikvision devices in the old city in East Jerusalem, nearly 40 of which were found on security infrastructure and illegal settlements in the Silwan neigborhood. The devices were \u201coperated by Israeli police and by private settlers\u201d and were \u201cmounted to military infrastructures and residential areas in and around the old city of East Jerusalem, in particular Damascus Gate, the Armenian quarter, the Muslim quarter, and Silwan\u201d.\n\nThe report is newly relevant in the weeks after the 7 October Hamas attacks that the Israeli government said killed 1,400 people. Since then, settlers have escalated their violence against West Bank Palestinians and the Israeli army has conducted raids in West Bank cities and refugee camps.\n\nHikvision has marketed facial-recognition features that would, it claimed, automatically detect Uyghur people. It has also advertised features meant to discern any person\u2019s ethnicity, age and race based on an image of their face. The Guardian first reported that Hikvision enabled police clients to set up alarms for when cameras detect any type of protest activity such as \u201cgathering crowds to disrupt order in public places\u201d, \u201cunlawful assembly, procession, demonstration\u201d and threats to \u201cpetition\u201d.\n\nHikvision did not respond to Amnesty\u2019s report on the use of its products , nor did the company provide an on-the-record response in time for publication. But Hikvision previously told the Guardian that it \u201chas strictly followed all applicable laws and regulations in the UK and all countries where we operate to ensure complete compliance.\n\n\u201cHikvision has never knowingly or intentionally committed human rights abuses itself or acted in willful disregard and will never do so in the future,\u201d the company\u2019s statement reads.\n\nExperts on surveillance tools used in the repression of Uyghurs argued the company\u2019s history shows Hikvision has not followed through on previous commitments to preserve human rights.\n\n\u201cHikvision\u2019s critical role in surveilling and oppressing Muslims in Xinjiang and the company\u2019s failure to take accountability shows that the company is not serious about ethics or protecting human rights,\u201d said Conor Healy, the director of government research at surveillance research publication Internet Protocol Video Market (IPVM) in a statement to the Guardian.\n\nThe Hikvision headquarters in Hangzhou, in eastern China\u2019s Zhejiang province. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe report identified specific products deployed in the West Bank that come enabled with human and vehicle recognition features out-of-the-box. Amnesty could not confirm definitively that facial recognition had been activated in all the products identified, but investigators said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d the cameras \u201care potentially being used together with facial recognition tools\u201d. Amnesty investigators said the cameras are at high risk of being connected to Mabat 2000, an Israeli police-run facial-recognition surveillance network that spans the entire city of East Jerusalem. The vast surveillance system \u201cenables Israeli authorities to identify protesters and keep Palestinians under constant observation, even as they go about their ordinary daily activities\u201d.\n\nUltimately, Palestinians \u201cdon\u2019t need to see\u201d that the cameras are employing facial recognition to \u201cknow that they are being watched at every turn\u201d, said Matthew Mahmoudi, an Amnesty International researcher on AI and human rights. Their fears are not unfounded. In 2021, the Washington Post revealed the existence of a vast database called Wolf Pack, which contained images of and all the information available on all 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cThese technologies are deployed to restrict the freedom of movement of Palestinians,\u201d Mahmoudi said. \u201cIn particular, your ability to move, to access work, to access education, to access medical facilities is stifled based on the usage of AI-based surveillance like facial recognition.\u201d\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry has said that more than 170 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in the past month. The intensity of the violence in the West Bank has forced the displacement of at least 11 Palestinian communities, whose residents have historically refused to leave despite the difficulties posed by both settlers and the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\n\u201cWe see how the technology ends up being used to deter Palestinians in places like Silwan in East Jerusalem from resisting and dissenting the expanding illegal settlements,\u201d Mahmoudi said.\n\nUnited Nations experts have warned that \u201cthe Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide\u201d as the Israeli army has bombarded Gaza, killing more than 10,000 Palestinians over the past month, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\n\u201cEven their family life and the sort of very mundane everyday actions suddenly become acts of resistance in the face of this ubiquitous surveillance apparatus that underpins much of how apartheid is exacted on Palestinians,\u201d Mahmoudi added.\n\nIn addition to the daily impact on Palestinian life that the vast surveillance network in the West Bank has had, there have been longer-term ramifications. According to the report, Amnesty International\u2019s Digital Verification Corps analyzed and verified the authenticity of 15 videos that showed Palestinians being detained \u201cwhere surveillance technologies appeared to have been used for registration, identification or recording\u201d. In one instance, Israeli police posted a video showing how they were able to identify a protester they had been monitoring through closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. They then showed that police officers were able to pick the particular individual out of a crowd, according to Mahmoudi.\n\n\u201cIn protests in particular, regardless of you being in a crowd, you\u2019re subjected to potentially being picked out and identified and persecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cThese technologies are being used in profoundly problematic ways when it comes to human rights.\u201d"

    "body": "Uber reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that show a profitable ride-hail and delivery company that\u2019s chugging along in spite of slowing growth in some sectors.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $9.3 billion, an 11% increase year over year. Investors had expected Uber to report revenues of around $9.5 billion (FactSet, Refinitiv), meaning that despite the company\u2019s growth, it fell short of estimates. Turning to profitability, Uber reported net income of $221 million in the third quarter, or 10 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Again, the company fell short of expectations that it would generate 12 cents in per-share profit.\n\nLooking ahead, Uber anticipates gross bookings of $36.5 billion to $37.5 billion, up just 6% at the top-end from its Q3 result.\n\nAfter reporting, shares of Uber are up 1.6% in trading, after an up-and-down morning of shares exchange.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, the former startup darling\u2019s results can be viewed as an indication that its business model has matured and is now in a stable, profitable and cash-generating position. On the other hand, under-performing demand results from a company as global as Uber could indicate that consumer spend is coming in lighter than anticipated.\n\nFor startups in the transport and on-demand sectors, Uber\u2019s earnings are a regular informational zeitgeist. So let\u2019s work to understand where Uber\u2019s revenue came from in the third quarter, and how each of its top-line sources converted \u2014 or not \u2014 to bottom-line results.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nIn the third quarter, Uber saw total bookings rise from $29.1 billion to $35.3 billion, a gain of around 21%. In business segment terms, Uber generated $17.9 billion in ride-hailing bookings (+31% year over year), and $16.1 billion worth of delivery bookings (+18%). Those key business groups at the company generated $5.1 billion and $2.9 billion in revenue, respectively, during the September quarter.\n\nThere\u2019s nuance to the revenue figures that we need to consider as the rule-changes in question do affect startups that operate in related categories. On the ride-hailing front, Uber told its investors that its Q3 2023 revenue was \u201cnegatively impacted by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue by $161 million.\u201d That was not the only legal change that led to Uber\u2019s results changing shape. Under its delivery business results, the company added that its revenue result was \u201cnegatively impacted by business model changes that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue by $360 million.\u201d\n\nThe combined impact of those two items was 8 percentage points of growth.\n\nThe profit perspective\n\nFrom bookings to revenues to profits: How did the main portions of Uber\u2019s business generate black ink?\n\nTurning to what Uber calls \u201csegment adjusted EBITDA,\u201d it\u2019s not hard to see how the company managed to rack up more income in its most recent quarter. Ride-hailing adjusted profit rose to $1.29 billion, up 43% from $898 million in the year-ago quarter, while delivery saw its own profitability skyrocket from $181 million in Q3 2022 to $413 million in its most recent fiscal period.\n\nUber did spend more during Q3 2023 when compared to its Q3 2022 result, but the 5% gain in \u201cCorporate G&A and Platform R&D\u201d costs to $595 million was far less than the gains we saw above. So, Uber\u2019s adjusted EBITDA rose from $516 million in aggregate to $1.09 billion in the third quarter of this year.\n\nOf course, adjusted EBITDA is to profit as hidden heels in men\u2019s shoes are to height, so we\u2019ll want some harder figures as well. In the third quarter, Uber generated $394 million in operating income and $219 million worth of net income. Mix in $966 million worth of positive operating cash flow, and Uber looks very healthy, given that all of the figures in this paragraph were improvements on its year-ago results.\n\nBut while food delivery and scooting humans about town were profitable for Uber in the quarter, the final major portion of its business had a more lackluster quarter.\n\nFreight falls\n\nOne area that continues to drag on Uber is its freight business.\n\nWhile Uber\u2019s ride-hailing and delivery business saw an uptick in gross bookings in the third quarter, Uber Freight experienced a 27% drop year-over-year. Revenue, as a result, had a similar fall.\n\nThe business unit reported revenue of $1.3 billion in the third quarter, a 27% drop from the same period last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Uber Freight had a 1% gain in revenue.\n\nThe results don\u2019t get any better once we turn to net income. On an adjusted basis, Uber Freight lost $13 million in the third quarter compared to a $1 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nUber said the dismal year-over-year revenue results for its freight business was driven by lower revenue per load and volume. Both are consequences of the challenging freight market cycle.\n\nUber Freight isn\u2019t alone. Other more recent entrants to the freight and logistics industry such as Flexport and Convoy have struggled this year. In Convoy\u2019s case, the business was forced to shut down with its assets gobbled up by Flexport.\n\nUber Freight continues to plug along, despite these economic headwinds. The question is whether Uber believes in the long-term income potential of freight.\n\nSo what?\n\nWhen discussing Uber\u2019s results internally, our vibe was that it is a very profitable and healthy company today, albeit one that is not growing as fast as the market had hoped. The fact that Uber\u2019s share price is up as we write this indicates that investors are content thus far to excuse the small Q3 misses and keep their eyes more focused on its year-over-year improvements and forward guidance. More when we get Lyft\u2019s numbers."

We speak to the experts to get the low-down on the issue.\n\nAnnual energy savings of \u00a3400\n\nProfessor Aoife Foley from Queen\u2019s University Belfast has calculated that household consumers could save more than \u00a3400 per year from their electricity bill depending on their tariff if the government scrapped DST at the end of October.\n\nDr Foley, who specialises in clean energy research, estimates that we could save \u00a31.20 a day and dramatically reduce demand on the National Grid.\n\n\u201cBy simply foregoing the winter DST in October, we save energy because it is brighter in the evening during winter, so we reduce commercial and residential electrical demand as people leave work earlier, and go home earlier, meaning less lighting and heating is needed,\u201d she said.\n\nMany people are concerned about spiking energy bills this winter (Getty/iStock)\n\nDuring winter, evening energy demand peaks between 5pm and 7pm, with UK households potentially facing three-hour power cuts this winter, the National Grid has warned, due to a shortage of gas.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer in an energy crisis in Europe but an energy war and, dependent on weather conditions this winter, it is very likely we may need to start rationing energy very seriously to avoid bigger energy issues in December and January when gas reserves start to run low,\u201d adds Professor Foley.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that by foregoing the DST in winter we would save a lot of energy, reduce our bills and carbon emissions during this energy war, especially during a cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nFewer road accidents\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has called for the abolition of DST, arguing that turning the clocks back increases the risk of road accidents, due to more people driving during darker winter months.\n\nThe Society has urged the UK government to adopt British Summer Time on a permanent basis.\n\n\u201cRoSPA is in favour of this proposal, and is calling for the government to adopt British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year,\u201d the society states.\n\nDark, icy roads can be dangerous (Getty)\n\n\u201cThis would mean road users will no longer experience the sudden onset of darkness during their autumn commutes, potentially saving many lives.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re not alone. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents also supports the call to abolish DST, citing figures from the RAC Foundation which state that road traffic collisions increase by 19 per cent in the fortnight after putting the clocks back one hour from British Summer Time, reducing by 11 per cent when we put the clocks forward.\n\nIncreased immunity\n\nGetting a good night\u2019s sleep during the winter months is essential in protecting us against the seasonal increase in colds and flu. Research shows that even a small reduction in sleep has been shown to impact your immune system, however.\n\nMaking the move from daylight saving time interferes with your natural circadian rhythm, the 24-hour biological cycle that is influenced by morning light and evening darkness, however.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understate the importance of a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d says Giulia Guerrini, lead pharmacist of digital pharmacy Medino. \u201cHaving too much or too little sleep can have adverse side effects, so you should aim to get between seven and eight hours of sleep as consistently as possible.\u201d\n\nNever underestimate the value of a good night\u2019s sleep (Getty)\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest disruptors to our sleep is when UK clocks go forward one hour at 1am on the last Sunday in March and go back one hour at 2am on the last Sunday in October, which is rapidly approaching on 30 October.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important aspects of a healthy sleep schedule is waking up around the same time each morning, so try to limit yourself to a one-hour window if you need to adjust when you get up in the morning and when you go to sleep at night. One hour sounds like an insignificant amount of time, but it can completely throw our circadian rhythm, or more simply known as internal clock, off balance,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite this, a spokesperson for Sleep School, a science-based sleep education and therapy service, told The Independent that it is \u201cimpartial\u201d on the extent to which the clocks changing impacts sleep, arguing that the important factor is the duration of time asleep and a consistent schedule.\n\nFewer depressive episodes\n\nA Danish study from 2017 of more than 185,000 people over 15 years found that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an 11 per cent rise in depressive episodes. Conversely, the switch from winter to summer time was found to have no effect.\n\nPeople frequently report an increase in SAD and depressive symptoms in winter (Getty/iStock)\n\n\u201cThis study shows that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an increase in the incidence rate of unipolar depressive episodes,\u201d the study authors concluded. \u201cDistress associated with the sudden advancement of sunset, marking the coming of a long period of short days, may explain this finding.\u201d\n\nA drop in heart attacks\n\nNot everyone is convinced, however. Charlie Morley, author of Wake Up to Sleep, cites a 2014 study by the College of Cardiology, which reported a significant drop in heart attacks in the 24 hours immediately following turning back the clocks.\n\n\u201cFascinatingly, each year when the clocks go back for Daylight Saving and 1.6 billion people across 70 countries gain an extra hour in bed, there is a 21 per cent decrease in heart attacks the next day,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a big drop in suicides and car crashes worldwide. That all adds up to tens of thousands of fewer deaths around the world from just one extra hour of sleep.\u201d\n\nWhen did Daylight Saving Time begin?\n\nThe UK first introduced Daylight Saving Time in 1916 when the government introduced British Summer Time (BST) to encourage people to spend more time outdoors in daylight.\n\nThe change hasn\u2019t always proved popular, however, with the European parliament voting in favour of scrapping DST in 2019, a change that was due to take effect for the first time in 2021, but plans have been stalled.\n\nA 2019 YouGov poll found that the majority of Brits were marginally in favour of keeping DST, however, with 44 per cent electing to keep the current system, while 39 per cent voted in favour of ditching the change."

    "body": "The Wild have relieved head coach Dean Evason and assistant coach Bob Woods of their duties effective immediately, the team said in a statement Monday evening. The Athletic\u2019s Michael Russo reports the Wild will be naming former Devils and Predators bench boss John Hynes as Evason\u2019s successor.\n\nWild GM Bill Guerin gave the following comment:\n\n\"Dean did an excellent job during his tenure with the Minnesota Wild, especially as Head Coach of our team. I am very thankful for his hard work and dedication to our organization. I would also like to thank Bob for his hard work during his time as an Assistant Coach with the Wild. I wish Dean, Bob and their families all the best in the future.\"\n\nEvason had been a member of the Wild organization since he was brought on as an assistant in 2018, while Woods joined the Wild bench one season prior. The 59-year-old Evason began his coaching career with the WHL\u2019s Calgary Hitmen as an assistant in 1998-99 after finishing out his playing career in Germany, working his way up the junior hockey ranks over the next handful of seasons. His first NHL job came courtesy of an assistant role with the Capitals immediately after the 2004-05 lockout, coaching Alex Ovechkin in his first seven NHL seasons.\n\nAfter departing Washington in 2012, Evason spent the next several seasons working in the Predators organization as the head coach of their AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. There, he helped guide more than a few future NHL stalwarts \u2014 namely Mattias Ekholm, Ryan Ellis, Filip Forsberg, Calle J\u00e4rnkrok, Viktor Arvidsson, and Kevin Fiala, among many others. After joining the Wild, he earned a promotion to head coach within two seasons when the Wild fired Bruce Boudreau late in the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nJust a couple of years later, Evason had coached the Wild to their best season in franchise history. The 2021-22 campaign saw the Wild break the 50-win mark for the first time since their inception in 2000, nearly sitting atop the Central Division with 113 points. That was in an extremely tough group with the 119-point Stanley Cup champion Avalanche and the 109-point Blues, whom the Wild bowed out to in the first round of the playoffs. The Wild remain without a playoff series victory since the 2015 postseason and have not advanced to a Conference Final since the 2002-03 season.\n\nSo with the Wild now far out of the playoff picture with a 5-10-4 record, sitting bottom five in the league in both goals for and against, a change was necessary and expected. Injuries and goaltending have certainly played a factor in their poor play \u2014 captain Jared Spurgeon missed the first 13 games of the season, and Filip Gustavsson\u2019s and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury\u2019s combined .878 SV% is near the bottom of the league.\n\nThey\u2019ve likely been unlucky, too. The Wild have controlled a slim majority of scoring chances and a strong majority of high-danger chances during 5-on-5 play, a common theme for an organization that\u2019s usually one of the more defensively stout in the league. But the culture around the team is evidently turning sour quickly, Kirill Kaprizov is on pace for a career-low 26 goals and has a team-worst -10 rating, and most of their depth defensemen have been significant liabilities. This roster is not all that different from the one that\u2019s finished top-three in the Central Division for three straight seasons, and it\u2019s certainly one that still has playoff aspirations.\n\nMinnesota has not won since Nov. 7 against the Islanders and is winless in seven straight.\n\nWoods, who had worked on the Capitals\u2019 bench with Evason briefly as an assistant in the early 2010s, is now on the open market after more than six seasons with the Wild. It\u2019s unclear whether the Wild will opt to fill his vacancy.\n\nHynes, who was let go by the Predators after last season, is technically in the final season of his contract with Nashville. That means the Predators had to grant permission to their divisional rival to speak to their former head coach and that Hynes will be paid by both Minnesota and Nashville this season.\n\nNow behind the bench of his third NHL franchise, he faces an uphill climb to get Minnesota back in the playoff picture. Hynes will suit up behind an NHL bench for a ninth consecutive season, as he was fired by the Devils and hired by Nashville midway through the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nThe Wild will certainly get a boost in the standings once Fleury and Gustavsson improve their play between the pipes, a likely scenario given their stellar performance last season. However, they again have the misfortune of being in quite a competitive division. The Avalanche and Stars occupy first and second place as expected powerhouses, while the Blues, Predators and Coyotes all sit at or above the .500 mark and, especially in Nashville\u2019s case, have posted decent underlying numbers.\n\nHynes\u2019 main job is simply to restore confidence in his group. This roster has the ability to play better \u2014 especially Kaprizov, who, despite the okay point production, has looked like a complete non-factor on some nights. The team also hopes a significant change behind the bench can boost their league-worst penalty kill, which is operating at just 66.7%. Penalty killing was an area of strength for Nashville last season, who finished tied for fourth in the NHL with an 82.6% success rate.\n\nThe Wild will be on the hook for the remainder of Evason\u2019s contract, which runs through 2024-25 at just under $2M per season."

    "body": "Australian super lightweight contender Liam Paro says he\u2019s got no time for \u201cschoolyard bullsh*t\u201d after being inadvertently caught in the middle of some classic boxing social media drama.\n\nA video of Paro sparring WBC lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson was circulated last week after the American sent it to Bill Haney, the father of former undisputed 135-pound champ, Devin.\n\nThe vision popped up while Stevenson was under-fire for his cautious performance in defeating Edwin De Los Santos, a fight which broke the record for the fewest punches landed over a 12-round contest.\n\nMORE: What Devin Haney's decision to vacate lightweight titles means for Gervonta Davis, Shakur Stevenson, Lomachenko, Kambosos and more\n\nIn the short clip, Stevenson gets the better of Paro and is much more active and aggressive than he was against De Los Santos.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a video from 2019. It makes him look stupid, I believe,\u201d Paro told Sporting News.\n\n\u201cSomeone in his camp has obviously leaked something out and it shows that it's obviously gotten to him.\n\n\u201cBut a 45-second clip of 240 minutes - we\u2019ve sparred over 80 rounds - if that's your best thing, well, fair enough, so be it, if that helps you sleep at night, good on you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing for me, I'll take the free exposure from the little bitchiness going on, but I\u2019ve just got my mind set on the job.\n\n\u201cI'll just let my actions speak for me. I think it's just stress you don't need to put on yourself and get involved in.\n\n\u201cBoxing is a very mentally stressful sport as it is. So when I'm not boxing and fighting, I like to kick back and stick to myself.\u201d\n\nParo, who, along with Stevenson, has sparred with the likes of Devin Haney and Rolly Romero over the course of several camps in Las Vegas, said he\u2019d still work with him again if required.\n\n\u201cWe've always had nothing but respect for him and his camp,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI don't get involved in the sh*t. I think it's a bit of schoolyard bullsh*t.\n\n\u201cI'm just going to get rounds in if we need him or if we fight another southpaw and that opportunity\u2019s there, of course, it\u2019d be a no brainer.\n\n\u201cHe's probably one of the best, if not the best, southpaw around.\n\n\u201cIf it's going to benefit me and my career, of course I'll get the work in.\u201d\n\nParo\u2019s is a career which has, unfortunately, stalled in 2023.\n\nAfter scoring a first-round knockout over Brock Jarvis last October, the Queenslander looked set for a big year.\n\nHe was lined up to face Robbie Davies Jnr in a headline slot in Liverpool in March before a routine CT scan picked up an unknown facial fracture, seeing the presiding commission rule him out.\n\nAfter that disappointment, the 27-year-old secured a long-awaited world title shot, against Regis Pregrais in New Orleans in June.\n\nThis time it was an Achilles tendon issue which forced him to withdraw, sidelining him for an extended period and temporarily seeing him relocate to his hometown of Mackay.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely heartbreaking. There's no other words for it,\u201d he said of the missed world title shot.\n\n\u201cI was so devastated. At one stage, it felt like everything was coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI've had a pretty smooth career until this year and two injuries, back-to-back, it definitely tested me mentally.\n\n\u201cI went through hell and back. I was lucky I was around the right people, I was supported by my loved ones up home.\n\n\u201cIt tested me, it's seen how much I really did love the sport and how dedicated I was to it.\n\n\u201cIt was just a full reset. It relit the fire in my belly.\n\n\u201cIt's just good to be back and I definitely want to leave all that in the past and keep steamrolling forward.\u201d\n\nNow back fit again, Paro faces Ohio\u2019s Montana Love in San Francisco on December 9 (Dec. 10 in Australia) on the undercard to the WBC super lightweight title bout between Haney and Prograis.\n\nWATCH: Paro vs. Love, live on DAZN\n\nAussie fans will recognise Love as the man who lost via disqualification when he threw Stevie Spark out of the ring in frustration last October.\n\nParo hopes to put a difficult run behind him and kick off a world title charge with an emphatic win on a big card.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just bring the fight to [Love], he likes a slow, controlled fight, a slow pace,\u201d Paro said of the challenge which awaits in his return.\n\n\u201cWe've seen with the [Spark] fight, a bit of pressure and he folds, so bring the fight to him.\n\n\u201cHe's obviously weak in the head a little bit and actions speak louder than words, you've seen that in his fight.\n\n\u201cSo we're going to bring the fight to him. Smart pressure, smart boxing.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe I'm better than him in every aspect, except wrestling.\u201d\n\nAfter previously being ranked number one in the division with the WBO, Paro is now 11th in line for a shot at the championship - a casualty of his inactivity.\n\n\u201cThe Prodigy\u201d is confident one good performance can put him right back at the front of the queue.\n\n\u201cI'm going to get my title shot,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI've proved it time and time again that I belong at the top level and I intend to do that on December 9, too, and stamp my way into a world title into an opposite corner and win it when I get my shot.\n\n\u201c2024, I want a busy year. I want to fight three times next year.\n\n\u201cI've only had one round in two years. I missed the sport and it's lit a new fire in my belly.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Paro vs. Love, live on DAZN"

Becker spent eight months in prison last year.\n\nTheir social media spat started when Kyrgios used Becker, a six-time Grand Slam title winner, as an example when claiming that older tennis players were poor pundits on modern tennis because the game has eveolved so much.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nWatch every Australian Open match ad-free, live & on demand with centre court in 4K Ultra-HD on the home of grand slam tennis, Stan Sport.\n\nBecker has said Kyrgios would not be making a living from the game had it not been for the trail blazed by the stars of his generation.\n\n\u201cUhhh what?

I\u2019ve been one of the FEW PLAYERS that have brought million more fans to the sport and have made more money for everyone. NETFLIX\u2026. Don\u2019t remember seeing Boris on there.

Not once have I said I\u2019ve impacted the game MORE. I\u2019ve simply said that I\u2019ve built my own brand and done it my way & brought fans. Apparently a slam finalist has no credibility. Night, done with this convo. \u2014 Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) December 19, 2023\n\nBecker told Eurosport: \u201cWe live in a democracy. Everyone can think what he wants. You have to have respect for the past and simply say \u2018thank you\u2019 out loud that these old pros existed, because without them the tennis circus would no longer exist.\n\n\u201cI did play a bit in the 80s, but there was [Stefan] Edberg, [Mats] Wilander. The 90s were [Andre] Agassi, [Pete] Sampras. All these players make it possible for Nick Kyrgios not to play tennis at all this year and still be able to make a living from tennis.\u201d\n\nKyrgios sparked the beef when he claimed current players are superior to those of the 70s and 80s.\n\n\u201cThe game was so slow back then. I\u2019ve watched Boris Becker and I\u2019m not saying they weren\u2019t good in their time, but to say that they would be just as good now, it\u2019s absurd,\u201d he told The Athletic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjokovic change that made him shine\n\nFormer French star Jo-Wilfried Tsonga says Novak Djokovic started out trying too hard to be like Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, but sent his career into overdrive when he embraced his true nature.\n\nThe former world No.5 told the Generation Do It Yourself podcast that Djokovic longed to be like his great rivals.\n\n\u201cI consider that he had a period where he didn\u2019t want to be himself. He wanted to be Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal, when perhaps he should have remained himself all along,\u201d Tsonga said.\n\n\u201cI think today he is himself. And even if it is divisive, I think that\u2019s why it is appreciated by many people. Because now he\u2019s completely honest.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to get away from this warrior image that he has, because he is a Serb, who experienced difficult things in his childhood. So he\u2019s a warrior, he should have assumed it from the start. I think he would have been loved for that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjokovic recently spoke about the relationship he has with Federer and Nadal.\n\n\u201cObviously we haven\u2019t gotten along very well during our careers off the field,\u201d he told 60 Minutes..\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not friends because we\u2019re rivals and it\u2019s difficult to be close as opponents. Some things you share about your life or how you feel can be used against you.\n\n\u201cWe have shared the stage for many years and I think there has always been the utmost respect, at least on my part, towards them.

It\u2019s normal that he is getting older and the recovery is not the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that he\u2019s going to keep on winning Slams, but it\u2019s going to be tougher and tougher and he knows that.\u201d\n\nWhile Djokovic ended 2023 as world No.1 for an eighth time, faced several defeats by the younger rivals including Lorenzo Musetti (at the Monte-Carlo Masters), Holger Rune (at the Rome Masters), Carlos Alcaraz (in the Wimbledon final) and Jannik Sinner (in the ATP Finals group stage and the Davis Cup).\n\n\u201cIn a way, I feel the match that he lost against [Jannik Sinner] in the Davis Cup might be good for him. It\u2019s a wake-up call to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m doing unbelievably, but I can\u2019t relax for one second because some of the guys behind me are going to push me so much. They\u2019re very dangerous and they know they can beat me now,\u2019\u201d Corretja said.\n\nPliskova bemoans loss of charisma\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarolina Pliskova fears the women\u2019s tour has suffered a loss of charisma with the retirements of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.\n\nPliskova, a former world No 1, believes there was a bigger interest in the women\u2019s game earlier in her career.\n\n\u201cI guess not only I feel that it\u2019s not entirely ideal, even though each of today\u2019s top girls has something to offer,\u201d Pliskova told iSport.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the tennis aspect, but charisma plays a role too. Sharapova and Serena were huge personalities, even in the marketing world. You can\u2019t compare today\u2019s girls with them.

    "body": "I did it. I made it over .500 for the season picking NFL games against the spread. Let's celebrate.\n\nIt's been a heck of a climb, one that has taken a few weeks. But after going 8-6 last week, I am now at 80-78-6 for the season. Let's go. I went 10-4 straight up last week to improve that mark to 99-65 for the season.\n\nThis week we have all 32 teams playing, which means a tougher challenge than in recent weeks.\n\nEven so, I like the card. It is Thanksgiving Week, and I have a lot to be thankful for, but next week you will be thanking me.\n\nHere's to an 11-5 week ATS and 12-4 week straight up.\n\nThursday, 12:30 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\n\nThis is a big game in the division for both teams, a survival test for Green Bay and a big one for the Lions if they want to try and get home-field advantage in the conference. The Lions have had defensive issues as of late and Jordan Love has played well the past two weeks. That will keep the Packers in this game, but the Lions win it.\n\nPick: Lions 31, Packers 27 (Result: Packers 29, Lions 22)\n\nThursday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\n\nThe Commanders are coming off a dud last week against the Giants, while Dallas is flying high. The Cowboys are playing as well as any team in the league. Washington's offensive line is an issue, which will lead to the Cowboys having a field day with their defensive front. Dak Prescott plays well again. Cowboys roll.\n\nPick: Cowboys 32, Commanders 16 (Result: Cowboys 45-10)\n\nThursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo)\n\nThis is a huge division game for two teams that have had a good rivalry over the past decade. The Seahawks are coming off a bad loss to the Rams, while the 49ers are coming off two dominant victories. Geno Smith is banged up, so his health is key. The 49ers have the look of a Super team again. They show it here.\n\nPick: 49ers 28, Seahawks 19 (Result: 49ers 31-13)\n\nFriday, 3 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime Video)\n\nThis Friday game the day after Thanksgiving isn't what it was expected to be with the Jets being an offensive disaster. The Jets defense is coming off a bad showing against Buffalo, and will be challenged here by the Dolphins. Tim Boyle will start at quarterback for the Jets, but will it matter? Even so, I think the Jets keep it close with their defense.\n\nPick: Dolphins 21, Jets 16 (Result: Dolphins 34-13)\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\n\nThis is a big game in a division with one team with a .500 record, that being the Saints. Both teams are coming off a bye, but the Saints have some injury issues. The quarterback situation isn't great for the Falcons, which is why I think the Saints will win it behind their defense.\n\nPick: Saints 24, Falcons 20\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\n\nThe Bengals without Joe Burrow will be a different team. Jake Browning starts, but we have no real idea what he can do. The Steelers defense is good. We know that. The Steelers fired offensive coordinator Matt Canada this week to hopefully liven up the offense. Kenny Pickett needs to play better now. He will here as the Steelers take it.\n\nPick: Steelers 23, Bengals 21\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\n\nThis is for first place in the division, with the Texans owning the Jaguars in recent years, winning 10 of 11 and blowing them out earlier this year. But the Jaguars got back on track last week and Trevor Lawrence played well. That will continue here as the Jaguars take command of the division.\n\nPick: Jaguars 27, Texans 23\n\nIf you want a more analytical approach to your NFL picks, then I highly suggest that you check out the SportsLine Projection Model, which has been on fire this year. Check it out if you want to know which side to bet for every game in Week 12.\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\n\nThe Bucs are playing a second straight road game, while the Colts are coming off a bye. That's a big edge for the Colts. Even so, I think the Bucs have the better team and Baker Mayfield will play well in this one. Gardner Minshew will not. Bucs win it, although they are banged up some on defense.\n\nPick: Bucs 30, Colts 21\n\nNew England Patriots (-3) at New York Giants\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\n\nThese are two of the bottom teams in the league, both with quarterback issues. Tommy DeVito did play well for the Giants last week, but Bill Belichick has had great success against rookie quarterbacks. The Patriots quarterback situation isn't good either, but I think the Patriots will find a way to win this one.\n\nPick: Patriots 21, Giants 17\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\n\nThis is the dog game of the week, featuring two rookie passers who are struggling behind bad lines. Bryce Young and Will Levis have been brutalized at times. What's to think that will change here? The Titans defense is better, so they get the best of it in what should be an ugly game.\n\nPick: Titans 23, Panthers 12\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Arizona Cardinals (PK)\n\nSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\n\nThe Rams are coming off a comeback victory over the Seahawks, while the Cardinals lost a tough one to the Texans last week. Kyler Murray has played well in his two starts, which I think will continue here. The Cardinals will slow down Matt Stafford and gang to win it.\n\nPick: Cardinals 27, Rams 23\n\nSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\n\nThis is suddenly a big game for both teams. The Broncos have won four straight, while the Browns are 7-3 and would be in the playoffs right now. This will be the first road start for Browns rookie quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, which won't be easy. But the Cleveland defense is dominant. They will shut down the Denver offense in a low-scoring game to win it.\n\nPick: Browns 20, Broncos 12\n\nSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\n\nThe Chiefs are coming off a tough Monday night loss and now must travel on a short week. The Raiders have looked so much better the past three games, but this is a tough test against a wounded Super Bowl champ. The Chiefs get back on track here.\n\nPick: Chiefs 27, Raiders 17\n\nSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\n\nThe Eagles are playing on a short week after a road victory over the Chiefs on Monday night. The Bills are coming off an impressive victory over the Jets. Josh Allen looked good in that game, and he will in this one. He keeps it close, but the Eagles find a way late.\n\nPick: Eagles 31, Bills 30\n\nSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo)\n\nThe Chargers are having major issues right now and face one of the best teams in the league in this one. The Ravens offense will miss tight end Mark Andrews, but the Chargers defense is perfect for any team throwing the football. The Ravens will win it with a big game from Lamar Jackson.\n\nPick: Ravens 30, Chargers 23\n\nMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN, fubo)\n\nThese two are coming off tough losses, with the Bears blowing a huge lead late. It was more damning for the Vikings, a team that had been surging. Minnesota's defense will be the difference here as they get the best of Justin Fields. Vikings take it.\n\nPick: Vikings 24, Bears 14"

    "body": "The hardcore football fans are pretty much done with the NFL harping about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. Reality TV star Rachel Lindsay, a longtime NFL fan, recently slammed the \u201cobnoxious\u201d coverage, highlighting the \u201cexhausting\u201d uptick in Swifties obsessing over football. But that\u2019s just one example of how fans are finding this fixation a little too disrespectful towards the sport.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nFrom the league\u2019s humble beginnings in 1920 to the $18 billion juggernaut that it is today, the ride has been rocky with more than just a few small bumps along the road. But with the ambitious target that NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has set for 2027, is there a new strategy in the 104-year-old league\u2019s master plan to dominate the world sporting scene?\n\nWhy the \u2018Traylor\u2019 saga will be the key to Roger Goodell\u2019s $27 billion target?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHow can you not love Taylor Swift? Most of the 12 Grammy Awardee\u2019s songs are about that warm fuzzy feeling and chemical reaction that we call love. And her songs have earned the support of 103.7992 million Swifties in the world. Yeah, we don\u2019t have a round figure for that. We have the exact figure up to four decimals. That\u2019s how much data we have on her. Football has 184 million fans. The league is able to generate a revenue of $18 billion from 184 million. If it adds 104 (after rounding 103.7992) million to that number, guess how much revenue it will generate? $28 billion. And just like that, their target will be met.\n\nUSA Today via Reuters NFL, American Football \u2013 Taylor Swift reacts while sitting next to Donna Kelce watching the Kansas City Chiefs vs Chicago Bears game during the first half at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, Kansas City, Missouri, USA | Image Credits: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\nAnd while analysts like Stephen A. Smith may go around telling people they should be embarrassed of themselves for getting so invested in someone else\u2019s relationship, it is good business for the NFL. TMZ reported that #87\u2019s jersey sales skyrocketed 400% and his Instagram followers by 276%. Yahoo Finance reported a 53% rise in viewership among teen girls. Who would have thought in their wildest dreams that the NFL would manage to rope in this part of the population? The October 1 matchup between the Chiefs and the Jets drew 27 million viewers. And became the most-watched Sunday TV show since the last Super Bowl! And the last Super Bowl had an actual concert by Rihanna.\n\nRevealed: The Dark Side Of Pat McAfee & Why Rob Gronkowski Is In The Firing Line\n\nKaepernick, who? Deflategate, what? In the media frenzy surrounding the two lovebirds, other issues get thrown out of the window. How can fans forget that the NFL is also organizing games outside the American borders with a view to garnering international appeal? The NFL has scheduled 5 games abroad this season. It is also addressing the concussion controversies. It recently added both new concussion rules and a new $100 million initiative called \u201cPlay Smart, Play Safe,\u201d to make the sport safer for players. And all the effort is showing.\n\nAccording to Joe Pompliano, \u201cThe NFL will bring in $20 billion in revenue this year, more than the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1 combined.\u201d Coming to the strategy part, a curious mind would perhaps think can they take a leaf out of the NBA\u2019s playbook and reinvigorate its appeal as it aims to conquer international audiences?\n\nCan the NFL take a leaf out of the NBA\u2019s grisly past and glorious recovery?\n\nThe NFL is already the world\u2019s richest league. Calling it an incredible feat would be a gross understatement. Consider this: the English Premier League, which is broadcast in over 212 territories, has a revenue of just $6 billion, while football games are primarily viewed in America only. However, the NFL does not just want to stop at $18 billion. It wants to become a $27 billion league in 4 years. But it must address a few skeletons in its closet before reaching that goal.\n\nIf you were around in the 1970s (that would make you at least 50 years old today), you would know that the NBA did not have the mass appeal that it enjoys now. With average game attendance hovering around 8,000 a game, it was one of the darkest periods of the basketball league. Drug abuse, brawls on the hardwood court that sometimes spilled over onto coaches and players \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. As reported in the Washington Post, even though there are no reliable figures on cocaine use by players, \u201cestimates by people in the game range from 40 percent to 75 percent.\u201d Revisiting the NBA caricature back in time, the New York Knicks became the first all-Black team in 1979. But their fans made their disapproval very apparent. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much New York attitudes, but fans around the league let you know how they felt about you as an opponent and as a Black man as well,\u201d Knicks star Earl Monroe told Newsday.\n\nUSA Today via Reuters May 15, 2021; San Antonio, Texas, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Torrey Craig (12) and San Antonio Spurs forward Keldon Johnson (3) fight for loose ball as Suns guards Devin Booker (1) and Chris Paul (3) look on in the third quarterat AT&T Center. Mandatory Credit: Scott Wachter-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWe could list out all the scandals, fights, and controversies here, but you get the idea. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who paid $1.8 million (approx.) in penalties on behalf of his team, the Dallas Mavericks, fondly remembered the former NBA commissioner David Stern, on his death in January 2020. Stern came and instituted an anti-drug agreement and even banned All-Star player Michal Richardson for life for drug abuse. The revitalized image of the NBA helped rake in the moolah from sponsors and made it more appealing to fans. He even went against the tide to open up the Olympic basketball competition to NBA players resulting in the famous \u201cDream Team\u201d of 1992. America has never failed to win a medal in the 19 Olympic basketball games that it has played since then.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe NFL has had its fair share of, um, let\u2019s say, \u201cbumps\u201d down the road as well. From Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem to protest against racism, to domestic violence by players, to the Deflategate and Bountygate scandals. But there have been bigger crises as well. The Union of Concerned Scientists accused the NFL of trying to intimidate scientists studying the link between CTE and pro football. The NFL is already way past other leagues in terms of revenue, and now with the pivotal shift in its strategy, \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite pastime\u201d is on its way to world domination.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of EssentiallySports.\n\nWatch This Story: Will Patrick Mahomes Eclipse Tom Brady as the NFL Goat?

    "body": "Hanh Badger was working from home the morning of 17 June 2021. She went to the kitchen to grab a second cup of coffee and noticed her daughter\u2019s bedroom door was still shut. Badger found Brooke, 17, pale and motionless in bed.\n\nSoon, the sheriff arrived and immediately administered Naloxone, a nasal spray that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. But Badger, a pharmacist, was confused. Brooke was a talented student who couldn\u2019t wait to begin college that fall.\n\n\u201cShe had the whole world in her hands,\u201d Badger said through tears. \u201cThere was no way in my mind that [Brooke] had died of a drug overdose.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing days, Badger\u2019s husband and son were able to gain access to Brooke\u2019s computer and, with it, her Snapchat account. They found screenshots of what looked like a menu of narcotics, and conversations with a drug dealer showing Brooke had purchased what she believed to be Roxicet, a prescription medication containing acetaminophen and oxycodone typically prescribed for pain relief. Instead, the substance was a counterfeit pill that held a lethal dose of fentanyl.\n\nAcross the US, young people are dying from fentanyl in record numbers, even as overall drug use is on the decline. Nationally, the number of opioid overdose deaths for people 24 and under nearly doubled from 2019-2021. And according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the number of overdoses attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl dwarfs that of any other substance.\n\nBrooke Badger, 17, died of an overdose at her California home. Photograph: Courtesy\n\nIn California, where Brooke lived, fentanyl-related overdose deaths among 15- to 19-year-olds surged by nearly 800% between 2018 and 2021, according to data from the California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard. Many are young victims poisoned by counterfeit pills that have been pressed to look like legitimate prescription drugs, but that are laced with fentanyl, an opioid that is deadly even in granular quantities. Typically, those teenagers acquired what they believed to be Percocet, Xanax or other pharmaceuticals online through social media.\n\nIn their grief, victims\u2019 parents are motivated to end this crisis to prevent another family\u2019s suffering while also giving meaning to their loss. Many have launched awareness campaigns, founded educational programs and advocated for legislative change. And now, some parents are taking to the civil courts, targeting the tech giants whose platforms facilitated their children\u2019s purchases of pills that killed them.\n\nIn April, the relatives of more than 65 victims, represented by the Social Media Victims Law Center, filed lawsuits against Snap, the parent company of Snapchat \u2013 an app known for its disappearing messages features, and the platform used by the vast majority of the suit\u2019s victims.\n\nThe suit claims Snapchat\u2019s features facilitate practices like drug sales by connecting dealers to young customers while promising safety from legal repercussions through anonymity. Chief among those designs is the promise that a message will disappear not only to fellow users, but also on the software\u2019s back end, says Matthew Bergman, the lead attorney on the case. It prevents law enforcement officials from seeing the activity of a dealer even after they have been identified.\n\nOther problematic features include notifying individuals when another person screenshots their post, the ability to geolocate fellow users and algorithms that suggest new connections based on demographics.\n\nIn response, Snapchat filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, citing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from being held responsible for the illegal actions of their users. A hearing for that motion has been scheduled for 18 October.\n\nBut Section 230 only offers immunity to companies that have acted responsibly and taken precautions to prevent illegal activity from taking place on their platforms, which Bergman says Snap hasn\u2019t done. \u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s largest open-air drug market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was clearly designed with the intention of allowing and encouraging nefarious activity with a lack of record.\u201d\n\nSnap did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request seeking comment prior to this story\u2019s release. After publication, a spokesperson said that Snap works to \u201cblock search results for drug-related terms\u201d and redirects at-risk users to resources on the dangers of fentanyl. \u201cWe have great empathy for families who have suffered unimaginable losses. At Snap, we are working hard to stop dealers from abusing our platform,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nPerla Mendoza, a parent in the suit, found that Snap did little to prevent illegal drug sales in the weeks and months after the death of her son, Daniel (Elijah) Figueroa, who bought fentanyl-laced pills from a dealer on Snapchat. Even after she created her own account and found her son\u2019s dealer posting images with hundreds of pills, Mendoza\u2019s reports to the help center went unanswered, and it took eight months for them to flag his account. \u201cIt was really disheartening,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Badger, removing a dealer\u2019s account alone is insufficient. \u201cThey\u2019ll just create another,\u201d she said, emphasizing the need for structural reforms that clearly warn young users of dealers\u2019 predatory practices, or that make it so that drugs can\u2019t be peddled to kids on the platform in the first place. \u201cSnapchat perpetuated this crisis,\u201d she said.\n\nAmy Neville, another parent in the suit, believes that Snapchat creates an aura of safety around an otherwise dangerous activity. She described her son Alexander, who died at 14 after taking a counterfeit Oxycontin tablet he procured through the app, as sensitive, impulsive and curious about many things \u2013 including drugs.\n\nBut he was also hesitant about putting himself in dangerous situations. And by using Snapchat, he was able to avoid an in-person meetup and have the pills delivered straight to his door. \u201cThe old way of scary back-alley type transactions \u2013 Alexander would have never done that,\u201d she said.\n\nNot every parent feels the same way.\n\nEd Ternan, whose 21-year-old son Charlie died in April 2020 after taking a counterfeit Percocet he bought on Snapchat, sees suing the platform as counterproductive. \u201cIt feels like looking backwards,\u201d he said.\n\nTernan, who did not join the suit, goes on to explain that losing his son \u2013 an energetic and fun-loving young man who was weeks away from graduating from UC Santa Cruz \u2013 has forced himself to come to terms with the factors that came together to cause Charlie\u2019s death. Ranging from the app and the dealer, to the friends Charlie bought drugs alongside, to himself as a father. \u201cWhat was my role as a parent?\u201d Ternan asked.\n\nA screenshot of pills being sold on Snapchat. Photograph: Courtesy\n\nThe conclusion he reached is one that looks beyond blame. With his wife, Ternan now works full time on initiatives to educate parents on the dangers of fentanyl. He has even worked with Snap to promote awareness campaigns and find ways to make the app safer. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very successful partnership,\u201d Ternan said.\n\nEven for Neville, who is a plaintiff, going through the process of filing a lawsuit has been re-traumatizing. It forces her to relive horrifying moments again and again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is worse, getting out and talking about it, or not talking about it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut for her, as it does for many parents, suing Snap represents just one iron in the fire. While Mendoza works to spread awareness of the risks of fentanyl to Spanish-speaking families, Neville travels to schools to share Alexander\u2019s story and hosts monthly online meetings that empower young people to do peer-to-peer youth outreach.\n\nIn doing so, she has learned that many parents and young people alike don\u2019t know about the existence of counterfeit pills \u2013 something she desperately wishes she had been aware of when her son was still alive. The night he died, Alexander had told his parents that he had been taking Oxycontin he got online, and that he wanted help. Neville and her husband immediately called a rehab facility and made plans to take him there the following day, but didn\u2019t think to take the pills away.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were doing everything right,\u201d Neville said. \u201cA little bit of information would have gone a long way in our household.\u201d"

    "body": "A normal person in a rural town has dreams of becoming a master. As they come of age and spring approaches, it\u2019s time for them to begin their journey to chase that dream. After saying goodbye to their mother and hometown, adventure awaits. They open the front door and take their first steps into a world full of new experiences and things to uncover.\n\nThat\u2019s right: it\u2019s time to enter the workforce!\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon that existed when Game Freak and series creator Satoshi Tajiri kick-started a phenomenon in 1996, and the one that premiered its first live-action TV series in Japan with Pack Your Pocket With Adventure (Pocket ni Bouken o Tsumekonde, or Pok\u00e9Tsume for short) last month, are almost unrecognizable. Which makes sense when you go from creating a game in a home office to a franchise more lucrative than the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Harry Potter, and Nintendo\u2019s own Mario combined.\n\nMore than 25 years since the original game\u2019s release, multiple generations of kids have become adults under the watchful eyes of Pikachu and friends, and the series has grown to encompass everything from anime and merchandise to card games and Hollywood blockbusters. Perhaps most surprisingly of all, with the growth in popularity of trading card games like Pok\u00e9mon in a postpandemic world and the record-breaking sales of the recent generation of titles despite quality concerns, it only seems to get more popular by the year.\n\nFor a franchise to retain relevance for as long as Pok\u00e9mon, it must evolve \u2014 and not just evolve but interweave its ideals into the fabric of daily life. Those early generations of kids need to pass on their love of Pok\u00e9mon like how Disney animated classics often serve as a formative childhood introduction to film.\n\nPerhaps nothing encapsulates Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s successful transformation from video game to a way of life quite like Pok\u00e9Tsume.\n\nPok\u00e9Tsume. Image: TV Tokyo\n\nBut what even is Pok\u00e9Tsume? Prior to the premiere of the series in Japan last month, there had only been one prior attempt at live-action storytelling within the world of Pok\u00e9mon: 2019\u2019s Detective Pikachu. Unlike Ryan Reynolds\u2019 wisecracking gumshoe Pikachu, Pok\u00e9Tsume was the first Japanese live-action foray into Pok\u00e9mon and doesn\u2019t even take place within the universe of the games.\n\nIn this series, we follow Madoka Akagi, portrayed by popular Japanese idol Nanase Nishino of Nogizaka46, a recent graduate moving out of her childhood home to live in the city and follow her dream of becoming a creator with an upstart company called ADventure. She played Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue (Red and Green in Japan) when she was a kid but has long since grown distant from the franchise.\n\nIllustration by Sarah Oh / The Verge Read next: Pok\u00e9mon Sleep helped me catch \u2019em all \u2014 all the z\u2019s, that is\n\nMuch of the opening episode of the series plays out as a nostalgic parallel between the trials of working life and the journey to become a Pok\u00e9mon Master. The childhood friend who works for another company is your rival. The product presentation to an investment CEO with the company\u2019s status on the line is a gym battle.\n\nShe rediscovers Pok\u00e9mon in a box of items sent from her mother and begins to replay this formative adventure; there are clips of the game or shots where we see the joy on the faces of both child and adult Madoka from the dim glow of the Game Boy screen. Pok\u00e9mon love even intertwines with the music scoring the series: a relaxing bar plays a slow jazz-infused rendition of the Pok\u00e9mon Center theme, just like how a synth rendition of Pallet Town marks the start of Madoka\u2019s journey.\n\nAs the show develops, the lessons from the game form the basis of a pseudo-episodic tale about Madoka\u2019s life at the company. The struggle to connect with a new client is paralleled by the way pok\u00e9mon won\u2019t listen to you until you\u2019ve proven your worth with gym badges. Learning and improving on the job is the experience that turns a flailing, floundering Magikarp into a job-leading Gyarados. And so on.\n\nThe show can come across a bit silly in places, and it struggles with communicating itself by making its Pok\u00e9mon overlay at times difficult to take seriously. But there\u2019s heart: there are plenty of touches that represent a series made with love, such as how characters have their own sprites integrated into the gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon Red.\n\nWith Pok\u00e9Tsume, Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t just a virtual journey to become a champion. It\u2019s a lesson we take with us into our daily lives long after our adventure is at an end. It\u2019s an integration of the morals of the franchise into our daily lives that epitomizes a 15-year transformation of the Pok\u00e9mon brand.\n\nThe 2021 remake of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl. Image: Nintendo\n\nTo understand this, we must first cast an eye back to 2006. During the preparation for the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS, developer Game Freak found the series at a crossroads. Sales had been on a steady decline since the original release, with the Hoenn GBA games at the time holding the distinction as the worst-selling mainline titles in the series. The reality was that the original generation of players had graduated from playing Pok\u00e9mon, and new generations simply weren\u2019t interested. Something had to change.\n\nIn response, the company launched the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Garden via the country\u2019s online Yahoo! Kids portal, an interactive experience taking you on a live tour through the history of Pok\u00e9mon, featuring mini-games and new information on the yet to be released Diamond and Pearl. Over 5 million unique users accessed Yahoo! Kids every month at this time, all within the series\u2019 core target demographic. In the end, the project proved successful, with Diamond and Pearl selling one-third more copies than its predecessors Ruby and Sapphire before eventually eclipsing the lifetime sales of those titles.\n\nNotably, at the time, it was one of the company\u2019s biggest attempts at diversifying the brand since its initial launch. Following the initial multimedia blitz, and the introduction of a World Championships and competitive circuit for the video games and TCG, the series remained relatively static. At this point, Pok\u00e9mon was yet to truly experiment with online distribution and promotion, nor had attempts been made to branch out beyond the series\u2019 core audience and multimedia properties following the initial surge in popularity.\n\nAs such, Pok\u00e9mon Garden was the first real attempt at expanding the core experience of Pok\u00e9mon to other platforms and audiences. While it\u2019s easy to mark 2016\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go as the key turning point for Pok\u00e9mon in its appeal to older demographics \u2014 and it certainly was significant \u2014 the framework for this success was paved far earlier by experiments in diversifying what Pok\u00e9mon could be, whether that be through experiences like Garden or the transformation of the anime to tell a greater array of stories within this ever-expanding universe.\n\nFor the first time, external partners were being brought in to expand the world of Pok\u00e9mon beyond Ash Ketchum. OLM, long-term Pok\u00e9mon animation studio since 1998, passed the baton to other studios with the production of a spinoff series: Pok\u00e9mon Origins. While the studio did assist in production and animated the finale for the four-episode series, the rest of production was a collaborative effort led by Production I.G and Xebec, and proved to be a hit with audiences craving something new from the world of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Concierge. Image: Netflix\n\nThis was just the beginning. Since then, no fewer than six unique web series have been produced by various external partners from around the world, each set in different regions within the world of Pok\u00e9mon. The most recent of these, this summer\u2019s Path to the Peak, was unique for taking place in the real world with a focus on the experience of competing in the TCG. Meanwhile, the upcoming Netflix series Pok\u00e9mon Concierge is another unique addition to this ever-expanding animation portfolio, marking the franchise\u2019s series debut in stop motion.\n\nThis is on top of a slew of one-off short films and music videos as well as a refocus of priorities for the long-running movie franchise. In 2017, the annual film franchise abandoned continuity with the TV anime in order to tell its own original stories without being confined by external events, allowing them to experiment with CG animation, remake the early episodes of the Pok\u00e9mon TV series in movie form, and allow Wit Studio, animators on the original series Attack on Titan, to helm their own movie with 2018\u2019s The Power of Us.\n\nThe company did more than simply introduce dynamism into an anime that had long since gone stale in the eyes of many. Greater efforts were made to integrate Pok\u00e9mon into the lives of communities in Japan and further afield, both through relief efforts and merchandising campaigns that provided more than toys and light relief to an aging audience.\n\nFollowing the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku and Fukushima, The Pok\u00e9mon Company joined many others in rushing to the aid of those affected. These efforts led to the establishment of the Pok\u00e9mon With You Foundation, aiming to provide support for disadvantaged communities even beyond this initial tragedy, expanding to everything from providing free educational materials and food drives for struggling children to funding scholarships. This was soon followed by partnerships with local governments across Japan for tourism initiatives, seen everywhere from Yokohama\u2019s yearly Pikachu Outbreak to the Pok\u00e9mon Local Acts initiative, which loans pok\u00e9mon out to flog local delicacies and hotspots, while serving as the origin of the country\u2019s charming Pok\u00e9mon-themed manhole covers.\n\nPikachu appears on a manhole cover in Yokohama. Photo by Stanislav Kogiku / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThis diversification naturally included merchandising. Many of the 10-year-olds who played the initial games were now adults with families of their own. This led to the launch of monpoke, a special line of Pok\u00e9mon-themed items for infants, as well as the now-discontinued Pok\u00e9mon Shirts, which sold button-up shirts and formal workwear based on various pok\u00e9mon.\n\nWith each of these efforts, alongside the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 which gave lapsed older audiences an accessible reentry point that could fit around their busy schedules \u2014 the franchise was suddenly less of a gaming curio and more an ingrained facet of modern life.\n\nBy the time the 2023 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships rolled around, the first to be held in Japan in Yokohama, the aforementioned Pikachu Outbreaks were transformed into a city-wide takeover. Beyond the competition and Pikachu marches were drone shows, pop-up Pok\u00e9mon Centers, an orchestral concert, an entire cruise ship transformed into the SS Anne, food collaborations, photo spots, station takeovers, and more. Yokohama felt less like a typical Japanese city and more like a location ripped directly from the world of Pok\u00e9mon itself. Within all that were families, often two or three generations, sharing in a mutual love of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. In recent years The Pok\u00e9mon Company has recorded record profits and revenue, while the games, anime, and TCG are more popular than ever, with both new mainline Switch entries selling over 20 million copies. The phenomenon of growing out of Pok\u00e9mon is no longer a concern. Even if young kids stop playing the video games as they grow, that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t still engage with this world via other means. Nor does it mean they won\u2019t introduce their own children to the series in the future.\n\nPok\u00e9Tsume is a series that\u2019s only possible because of a reinvention of what Pok\u00e9mon can be. While, in reality, it\u2019s a mostly light, inoffensive promotional tool to sell games (it\u2019s no coincidence the second episode has a scene of a young kid playing the latest entries in the series on his Nintendo Switch), it represents everything the franchise has aimed to be in recent years. Rather than a series for children, Pok\u00e9mon now promises something for everyone. And those new adults seeking direction in life might find a fellow directionless 20-something employee more relatable than a kid wanting to be a Pok\u00e9mon Champion. Frankly, it\u2019s a way to see they aren\u2019t alone, no different from how your party of pok\u00e9mon kept you company through the deepest caverns of Mt. Moon."

    "body": "When Noora Niasari was five years old, she lived in a women\u2019s shelter with her Iranian mother. They were fleeing family violence in a country that wasn\u2019t entirely familiar, trying to make a new life.\n\nThat personal experience has informed Niasari\u2019s debut feature, Shayda, which has been storming the global festival circuit since it premiered at Sundance film festival in January, winning an audience award. Released in Australia on 5 October, the film has already claimed the top prize at CinefestOz, opened the Melbourne international film festival, and been selected to represent Australia in the international film category at the Oscars.\n\nIt\u2019s a sensational reception for a first film, particularly given the specificity of its story: Shayda is a dramatisation of Niasari\u2019s early life, set in the Iranian diaspora community of suburban Melbourne. \u201cIt was something I had experienced, but I hadn\u2019t really seen on screen before,\u201d Niasari says of the movie she started thinking about straight after finishing film school. \u201cBut I first had to ask my mum for her permission and participation, because I had such a blurry memory of that time.\u201d\n\nNiasari asked her mother to write her memoirs, which took six months; that writing formed the basis of the first incarnation of Shayda\u2019s script. Shayda evolved over time \u2013 and it\u2019s not always a direct mirror of what happened to them both \u2013 but \u201cit is very emotionally true to our experience\u201d.\n\nExecutive produced by Cate Blanchett, Niasari\u2019s movie tells the story of Shayda (Zar Amir Ebrahimi), an Iranian immigrant in Melbourne who leaves her abusive husband Hossein (Osamah Sami) with her daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia) in tow. Shayda finds refuge in a women\u2019s shelter where the kindly Joyce (Leah Purcell) protects and guides her through the tough legal process of a custody fight.\n\nZar Amir Ebrahimi and Selina Zahednia as Shayda and Mona. Photograph: Miff\n\nIt\u2019s a tender and revealing film that balances Shayda\u2019s discovery of inner strength with the sacrifices she makes for her daughter, as she tries to create a new family for her. It\u2019s understated, relatable and drawn from such personal memories that Niasara describes working on it as \u201clong-term exposure therapy\u201d. Even doing interviews to promote the movie is difficult. \u201cI have to sit with it and process it,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut the thing is, now that it\u2019s a film, it has a really different energy in the world. People bring their own experiences to it, it\u2019s a very universal experience. We\u2019ve screened it in Europe, North America and Australia and there is a real sense that it connects beyond my mother and I, beyond our experience. It\u2019s not about us any more. That feels liberating and cathartic.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Saved for Later Free newsletter Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shayda\u2019s story may be centred on escaping abuse and fighting for custody of her child, but it\u2019s also about friendship, music, dance, laughter and reclaiming freedom. There\u2019s something elementally hopeful about the film.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to find that balance in the story because \u2026 it\u2019s life, there are ups and downs,\u201d she says. A large part of the film is devoted to the character holding on to the rituals of Persian New Year, and finding a way to connect with her culture amid the upheaval.\n\n\u201cFor her, that\u2019s through music and poetry and dance, and sharing that with her daughter. It became fundamental to the story. That was how I grew up as well. We\u2019re in the Australian suburbs but I lived in a Persian house with my mum\u2019s cooking and music.\n\n\u2018The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it\u2019s not just me looking at my mum in admiration,\u2019 says Niasari. Photograph: Miff\n\n\u201cI grew up with all of the beauty of our culture. So I had a natural inclination to include those moments [in the film]. You can feel the joyous moments even deeper when you have that tension or darkness around it.\u201d\n\nIt has been a year since 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died in custody, after being arrested for allegedly not complying with the country\u2019s hijab laws. Her death led to a huge wave of popular unrest in Iran; Niasari hopes renewed international awareness of Iranian women\u2019s resistance will lead to more stories being told.\n\n\u201cThe world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it\u2019s not just me looking at my mum in admiration. Shayda is just one of those women who happened to leave Iran and make her own sacrifices and her own life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more and more important to showcase the diaspora experience as well, especially given what\u2019s happening in the world with displacement, exile and migration due to conditions in the country. So, I\u2019m really optimistic about the storytellers coming through and being able to tell a different kind of story.\u201d"

    "body": "In a dramatic turn of events late Friday, ex-Y Combinator president Sam Altman was fired as CEO of AI startup OpenAI, the company behind viral AI hits like ChatGPT, GPT-4 and DALL-E 3, by OpenAI\u2019s board of directors. Then, the company\u2019s longtime president and co-founder, Greg Brockman, resigned \u2014 as did three senior OpenAI researchers. And the fallout continues.\n\nTip TechCrunch\n\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure?\n\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure? Get in touch with TechCrunch\n\nIt\u2019s a fast-moving situation that we\u2019re still trying to get to the bottom of. No doubt more will become clear as time goes on. To make it easier to follow all that\u2019s happened in the meantime, though, we\u2019ve put together a timeline; we\u2019ll do our best to keep it current.\n\nTimeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI\n\nNovember 29\n\nMicrosoft gains a board observer\n\nMicrosoft will gain representation on the new initial board of directors in the form of a non-voting observer, OpenAI announced. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear who this observer might be \u2014 only that they won\u2019t have an official vote in board business.\n\nNovember 21\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI reach agreement on return as CEO and \u2018initial\u2019 new board\n\nIn a sudden late announcement, OpenAI revealed that it and Altman \u201chave reached an agreement in principle\u201d for him to return as the company\u2019s CEO. In addition to Altman\u2019s return, its new \u201cinitial\u201d board will include former Salesforce chief executive Bret Taylor, former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers and Quora founder Adam D\u2019Angelo.\n\nWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo. We are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this. \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 22, 2023\n\nAltman also posted about the new deal, giving some insight into the roller coaster that we\u2019ve all been riding since his firing was revealed Friday. In his words, his decision to join Microsoft on Sunday \u201cwas the best path for me and the team.\u201d Since then, the new board\u2019s composition and Microsoft\u2019s support appear to have been enough to bring him back to the AI company he co-founded.\n\nAltman and board in talks\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors is reportedly in talks with Sam Altman, ex-Y Combinator president and an OpenAI co-founder, to return to OpenAI as CEO as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg, which in a brief \u2014 citing sources close to the matter \u2014 said that discussions are happening between Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, one current member of the OpenAI board, and Altman \u2014 and possibly other board members as well.\n\nBoard tensions boil over\n\nThe New York Times reports that, before his ousting, Sam Altman made a move to push out board member Helen Toner because he thought a paper she had co-written was overly critical of OpenAI. That, among other issues, led to OpenAI\u2019s current predicament. Speaking of, The Times indicates that negotiations to hire Altman back continue \u2014 but that one major sticking point remaining is \u201cguardrails\u201d meant to improve Altman\u2019s communication with the board.\n\n\u2014\n\nNovember 20\n\nAltman joins Microsoft\n\nSam Altman, Greg Brockman and colleagues announce that they\u2019ll join Microsoft to lead a new AI research team. Nadella leaves the door open to other OpenAI staffers, saying that they\u2019ll be given the resources they need should they choose to join.\n\nSutskever\u2019s mea culpa\n\nSutskever publishes a post on X suggesting that he regrets his decision to remove Altman and that he\u2019ll do everything in his power to reinstate Altman as CEO.\n\nI deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company. \u2014 Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) November 20, 2023\n\nEmployees threaten to resign\n\nNearly 500 of OpenAI\u2019s roughly 770 employees \u2014 including, remarkably, Sutskever \u2014 publish a letter saying that they might quit unless the startup\u2019s board resigns and reappoints the ousted Altman. Later Monday, that number climbed to over 650.\n\nAltman and Brockman considering return\n\nAs reported by The Verge, Altman\u2019s move to Microsoft isn\u2019t a done deal \u2014 and both Altman and Brockman are still open to returning to OpenAI. That is, if the remaining board members who initially fired him step aside.\n\nOpenAI board considers merger\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors approached Dario Amodei, the co-founder and CEO of rival large-language model developer Anthropic, about a potential merger of the two companies, The Information reports. The approach was part of an effort by OpenAI to persuade Amodei to replace Altman as CEO \u2014 but Amodei quickly turned down the CEO offer.\n\n\u2014\n\nNovember 19\n\nAltman to meet at OpenAI HQ\n\nAccording to The Information, Altman is expected to meet at OpenAI\u2019s San Francisco headquarters as executives at OpenAI push to have him reinstated as CEO. Brockman was invited to join \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll take execs up on that invitation.\n\nBoard negotiations hit a snag\n\nBloomberg reports that Lightcap and Murati, among others, are pushing the board to reinstate Altman. But unsurprisingly, the directors are resisting. As of midday Sunday, the board hadn\u2019t resigned out of concern over who could replace them, and were vetting candidates. One possible new addition could be Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor.\n\nAltman out, Shear in\n\nAltman won\u2019t be returning as CEO, according to a report in The Information citing an internal memo sent by Sutskever. As the search for a new permanent CEO continues, OpenAI has appointed Emmett Shear, the co-founder of video streaming site Twitch, as interim CEO \u2014 replacing Murati.\n\n\u2014\n\nNovember 18\n\n\u201cNot \u2026 in response to malfeasance\u201d\n\nIn an internal memo obtained by Axios sent Saturday morning, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said yesterday\u2019s announcement \u201ctook [the management team] by surprise\u201d and that management had had \u201cmultiple conversations with the board to try to better understand the reasons and process behind their decision.\u201d Discussions were ongoing as of Saturday morning, per the memo.\n\n\u201cWe can say definitively that the board\u2019s decision was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices,\u201d Lightcap added. \u201cThis was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board \u2026 We still share your concerns about how the process has been handled, are working to resolve the situation, and will provide updates as we\u2019re able.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s funding in jeopardy\n\nThe planned sale of OpenAI employee shares that would value the startup at about $86 billion could be in jeopardy. The Information, speaking to three sources formerly with the company, reports that they no longer expect the sale \u2014 led by Thrive Capital \u2014 to happen, or, if it does, to come with a lesser valuation because of the recent turn of events.\n\nAltman planning new venture\n\nAltman has been telling investors that he\u2019s planning to launch a new venture, according to The Information. Brockman is expected to join the effort \u2014 whatever form it takes. (Possibly an AI chip startup.)\n\ni love you all. today was a weird experience in many ways. but one unexpected one is that it has been sorta like reading your own eulogy while you\u2019re still alive. the outpouring of love is awesome. one takeaway: go tell your friends how great you think they are. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 18, 2023\n\nInvestors pushing for Altman\u2019s return\n\nInvestors \u2014 furious at the turn of events \u2014 are reportedly exerting pressure on OpenAI\u2019s board to reinstate Altman, going so far as to recruit Microsoft. Nadella is said to be sympathetic.\n\nBoard agrees to reverse course \u2014 in principle\n\nThe Verge reports that the board agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman and Brockman to return. It waffled, however, missing a deadline yesterday by which many OpenAI staffers were set to leave the company. Altman is said to be ambivalent about coming back and asking for \u201csignificant\u201d governance changes.\n\n\u2014\n\nNovember 17\n\nBrockman demoted\n\nBrockman says he got a text from Sutskever shortly after noon on Friday asking for a quick call. After sending a Google Meet link, Brockman was told that he was being removed from the board as chairman \u201cbut was vital to the company and would retain his role\u201d as president, and that Altman had been fired.\n\nAltman\u2019s firing publicly announced\n\nOpenAI published a post on its blog announcing the executive shake-up. The company\u2019s management team was aware shortly after.\n\ni loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later. \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 17, 2023\n\nAll-hands meeting\n\nOpenAI held an all-hands meeting Friday afternoon during which Sutskever defended Altman\u2019s ouster. He dismissed suggestions that pushing Altman out amounted to a \u201chostile takeover,\u201d and claimed that it was necessary to protect OpenAI\u2019s mission of \u201cmaking AI beneficial to humanity.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft releases a statement\n\nSatya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major investor in \u2014 and partner with \u2014 OpenAI, published a statement about Altman\u2019s firing:\n\n\u201cAs you saw at Microsoft Ignite this week, we\u2019re continuing to rapidly innovate for this era of AI, with over 100 announcements across the full tech stack from AI systems, models and tools in Azure, to Copilot. Most importantly, we\u2019re committed to delivering all of this to our customers while building for the future. We have a long-term agreement with OpenAI with full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and an exciting product roadmap; and remain committed to our partnership, and to Mira and the team. Together, we will continue to deliver the meaningful benefits of this technology to the world.\u201d\n\nBrockman quits\n\nBrockman announced his resignation from OpenAI, citing \u201ctoday\u2019s news.\u201d After sending a memo internally, he published the text on X.\n\nAfter learning today\u2019s news, this is the message I sent to the OpenAI team: https://t.co/NMnG16yFmm pic.twitter.com/8x39P0ejOM \u2014 Greg Brockman (@gdb) November 18, 2023\n\nSenior OpenAI researchers resign\n\nThree senior OpenAI researchers resign after Brockman, including the director of research Jakub Pachocki and head of preparedness Aleksander Madry.\n\n\u2014\n\nNovember 16\n\nIlya Sutskever schedules call with Altman\n\nAccording to a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, the chief scientist at OpenAI and a co-founder, texted Altman on Thursday evening about scheduling a Friday noon call.\n\nSam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today. Let us first say thank you to all the incredible people who we have worked with at OpenAI, our customers, our investors, and all of those who have been reaching out. We too are still trying to figure out exactly\u2026 \u2014 Greg Brockman (@gdb) November 18, 2023\n\nMurati told of Altman\u2019s firing\n\nBrockman alleges that Mira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s CTO and now interim CEO, was informed on Thursday night that Altman would be fired."

    "body": "2023 has been a topsy-turvy year for many teams. While some have outshone others, these 5 teams are at a crossroads, with a common stifling problem. Amid the heavy restructuring that many of the MLB teams have seen of late, there are pentagonal vacancies for managers. The New York Mets, the Los Angeles Angels, the Houston Astros, the Cleveland Guardians, and the San Diego Padres are in dire need of filling up the managerial position as the year ends.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nWhile some team representatives skim through names within the MLB world, some hope to look for an outside hire. It could be a risky state for all of them. Nevertheless, there are many possibilities and roadblocks one might encounter. Be it budgetary issues, past performance, or availability of candidates, these teams have not had success in putting a pin on one candidate. That said, the skipper market is abuzz!\n\nStarting With The Los Angeles Angels\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nAfter Joe Maddon was relieved of his managerial duties, Phil Nevin signed up as the interim manager for the remaining 106 games of 2022. Post that, he went on to sign a one-year contract to manage the Angels in 2023, and the interim tag was lifted. Nevin\u2019s 2024 club option was rejected by the Halos, who underwent partial two seasons of 119-149 (.444) play under his supervision. Since this was a non-negotiable, the seat stands vacant.\n\nThe biggest challenge in this scenario is that the Angels star, Shohei Ohtani is yet to reveal which team he would be joining. In case the Angels re-sign the two-way phenom, the manager would get to head the roster with the 2021 MVP and Mike Trout. A once in a lifetime opportunity. On the flip side, if they lose Ohtani, the roster would need a solid revamp. Not to mention the Angles are infamous for their below-par farm system and playoff drought spanning 9 seasons.\n\nWith that out in the open, what are the possible options for the Halos? Ray Montgomery could be an option, considering that he began his tenure with the Angels. Walt Weiss could potentially be a decent fit, too. Weiss has been a part of a successful team in the Atlanta Braves recently, having been their bench coach since before the 2018 season. Additionally, among other options are Ron Washington and Clayton McCullough. Though these options are open, no solid information has been revealed yet as to who would fill up the position.\n\nMoving On To The Houston Astros\n\nAfter his fourth season with the Astros and his 26th big league managerial season, Dusty Baker announced his retirement last week. Houston won the 2022 World Series and two pennants while the 74-year-old was in charge. Despite the starry possibilities of winning, the Texas Rangers defeated the Astros in the ALCS 2023.\n\nWith that seat now waiting to be warmed up, the future manager would manage a seasoned roster that appears ready to make another push at winning a World Series after winning six of the previous seven AL West championships. However, given Luis Garcia\u2019s Tommy John surgery and Lance McCullers Jr.\u2019s forearm surgery, the starting pitchers are expected to be shaky.\n\nThat said, there are some obvious options available to replace Dusty. One of the most sensible picks for a smooth transition would be Joe Espada, age 48. Since 2018, he has been the bench coach for the Astros. Baker relied on him in the dugout throughout his productive tenure as manager of Houston.\n\nApart from him, Buck Showalter, former New York Mets manager, Don Mattingly, Toronto Blue Jays bench coach, and A. J. Hinch, Detroit Tigers manager could be other possibilities.\n\nNext Up Is Cleveland Guardians\n\nFollowing an 11-year tenure with Cleveland that included leading the team to a 921-757 record (.549), six playoff trips, and the 2016 AL pennant, Terry Francona announced his resignation. The record made him the winningest manager in franchise history. He had managed the Guardians till the conclusion of the 2023 season, but now, owing to health concerns, he decides to put his wellbeing first.\n\nSince Cleveland usually has one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, the team\u2019s lineup won\u2019t be receiving a lot of outside reinforcement. It is clear that the Guardians are not keen on getting someone from within MLB; they are open to outside hires as well. As long as the new candidate can follow Terry\u2019s principles.\n\nOne applicant slated for an interview was Craig Albernaz. He is the catching and bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants, according to Paul Hoynes of Cleveland.com. Despite lacking Major League managerial experience, the 40-year-old has led two championship-winning Tampa Bay Rays teams. Another likely candidate could be Carlos Mendoza, who is the bench coach for the New York Yankees. Though he too lacks managerial experience in MLB, the 43-year-old is familiar with the Yankees system, suiting well for Cleveland.\n\nSpeaking Of NY, The New York Mets Are On The Lookout\n\nIn his first season as manager, Buck Showalter guided the Mets to a 101-61 record. With that, he earned him the 2022 NL Manager of the Year Award. However, despite having baseball\u2019s largest budget, the Mets ended their 2023 with a disastrous 75-87. Under the new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the organization is taking a fresh approach. The man who described 2023 as \u201cthe roller coaster of disappointment and hope\u201d presiding over the Mets views his limited options.\n\nGabe Kapler made the exit three days before the San Francisco Giants season\u2019s conclusion; he could post as a suited candidate. Another likely possibility would be Craig Counsell, who is nearing the end of his contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. Counsell is the guy to watch out for this summer because of his excellent relationship with David Stearns. This newest president of baseball operations for the Mets is a former Brewer himself.\n\nThe Fifth Team In The List Is San Diego Padres\n\nBob Melvin was said to be returning to the Padres as manager, despite the team\u2019s 82-80 record and 2023 postseason absence. But in a turn of events, the San Francisco Giants hired Melvin when San Diego gave permission to interview him for SanFran\u2019s managerial vacancy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nNow, the Padres\u2019 vacant position is linking to former Cardinals manager Mike Shildt multiple times. Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports reports that Shildt is the front-runner to take over. \u201cThe Padres will be hiring their sixth manager in just 10 years under (general manager) A. J. Preller. Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt is the favorite while associate manager Ryan Flaherty is getting strong consideration,\u201d Nightengale said. With that, one has to wait and watch who serves as the best fit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWith the facts broken down, it is a matter of time that the teams narrow down their best options. MLB world will welcome 2024 with high expectations. With new management, the fans expect teams to come back with great vigor and ferocity.\n\nWatch This Story: Every MLB Team That Has Never Won a World Series"

    "body": "There's something of a theme running through Teenage Engineering's recent products. That theme is you need more money. The Field range represents the Swedish company\u2019s most exclusive music making gear. So when its website teased a new product with a colorful countdown, the wallets of Teenies everywhere braced for impact. Once that timer hit all zeros, the big reveal turned out to be the EP-133 sampler. Or, to give it its full name, the EP-133 K.O. II 64MB Sampler Composer. The real surprise though, was that it both looked cool and, at $299, was reasonably priced.\n\nFadergate\n\nThe countdown was really just the start. Barely 24 hours after the K.O. II was revealed units started landing in buyers\u2019 hands. Within days, YouTube was awash with first look videos and tutorials. Before our review unit even showed up, several users were complaining that theirs had defective faders. Enough folks were having this problem that it quickly became known as \u201cfadergate.\u201d One brave creator even took their unit apart and, possibly, discovered the cause \u2014 the internal pins were bent and not making a connection. I asked Teenage Engineering about the issue and will update this story once I hear back.\n\nSome buyer\u2019s theorized that the issue might be caused by the fact that the K.O. II ships without the caps on its rotaries and fader. They come loose in the box to enable the packaging to be flatter, but the cap for the fader is unusually tight fitting. This led to speculation that the enthusiasm required to push this cap down might be putting too much pressure on components inside, opening up the cruel possibility of users breaking their own devices before they even got to play with them. I used extra caution, along with some needle-nosed tweezers to support the fader as I applied its cap and so far\u2026 so good?\n\nPhoto by James Trew / Engadget\n\nThe K.O. II name tells us that Teenage Engineering considers this something of a sequel to the original PO-33 K.O. Clearly the K.O. II isn\u2019t a Pocket Operator, but its retro desk calculator aesthetic does take subtle design cues from that series. At 12-inches diagonally, it\u2019s in iPad territory size-wise. The K.O. II also runs on AAA batteries (or USB power) which is another nod to the PO series. It\u2019s hard to say how long it\u2019ll run on those batteries and it\u2019ll vary from brand to brand, but I\u2019ve been using some cheap rechargeables for over a week and they seem to be going strong.\n\nPersonally, I was never particularly enamored with the Pocket Operators and much prefer the form factor of the K.O. II. It\u2019s still very portable, but feels a bit more \u201cserious.\u201d It\u2019s also just very nice to look at, which is something Teenage Engineering is quite good at. The model number, EP-133, indicates that we might see others in the line, so fingers crossed for giant calculator versions of other instruments, too.\n\nIn use\n\nFader fully checked and batteries in place, the K.O. II springs to life with a flourish of icons across its display. Those icons are actually fixed and not made up of pixels. Teenage Engineering calls it a \u201cSuper segment hybrid display\u201d which basically fuses the digital watch part with a bunch of colorful, cute custom icons to let you know when certain modes or features are activated. It reminds me of the old Game & Watch handhelds where you can see where all the icons are and they are simply switched on or off as needed. Some of the icons are pretty abstract but there is a guide on the website to let you know that, for example, the red umbrella means undo.\n\nPhoto by James Trew / Engadget\n\nSomething I like to do with music gear is to see how easy it is to use without reading the manual. This works for all gadgets of course, but with music gear there are common tasks like sequencing, timing adjustment, automation and so on. How you achieve these on a drum machine might be very different to a keys-based synth. Teenage Engineering in particular likes to do things its own way but I was pleasantly surprised with the K.O. II. Within minutes I had managed to figure out basic navigation and how things are organized (sample groups, accessing shift functions, what the fader does and when and so on).\n\nDuring this blind test I also got to know the K.O. II\u2019s buttons and faders. It was obvious from the launch materials that we weren\u2019t getting rubber MPC-esque pads here but I would describe the ones on the K.O. as keys rather than buttons. Fortunately they are satisfying to click and they\u2019re pressure sensitive so you can give your drum hits different velocities or play notes at different strengths, just be sure to focus on the lower part of the key as that seems to be where the sensor is.\n\nYou probably should read the manual though. If for no other reason than it\u2019s likely the prettiest one you\u2019ll use in a while. There\u2019s also a very cute tool for managing your samples which works via desktop browser. For the brave, you can also use this on your phone if you have Android (Chrome, Brave and Opera should all work). On iOS the same browsers can\u2019t access Web MIDI and therefore will not work. (There\u2019s the iOS Web MIDI Browser which crashes when I tried it with an iPhone but it does connect so your mileage may vary.) The K.O. II won\u2019t show up on your PC as either a drive or an audio interface, so the main uses for the USB port are power and sending/receiving MIDI.\n\nThe workflow for grabbing sounds is pretty straightforward. If you want to sample from either a PC or phone or other sound-making device then as long as you can connect it to a 3.5mm cable you\u2019re golden. For everything else, you\u2019ll be using the built-in mic, which is surprisingly good. I recorded a few short vocal phrases and other found sounds and they come out well, assuming you\u2019re in a quiet environment.\n\nPhoto by James Trew / Engadget\n\nDon\u2019t worry though, if you don\u2019t have a bunch of samples yet, the K.O. II comes with a bunch pre-installed, and they\u2019re pretty great. There\u2019s a good mix of drums, bass pads and lead sounds \u2014 certainly enough to get you going straight away. You\u2019ll definitely want to add your own though to make your projects unique. The presets use about half of the 64MB of memory, but you can back them up, delete them and free the slots up for your own. Max sample length is 20 seconds (same as on the OP-1 Field).\n\nIf 64MB doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, know that it translates to about 11 minutes of samples at the 46kHz/16bit in which the K.O. II records. You can halve that time if you sample in stereo. Even if you go all out, over five minutes of samples should be plenty enough for most songs (we hope). If there\u2019s going to be a bottleneck, it\u2019ll more likely be due to the 12-voice limit. This means the K.O. II can make 12 sounds at once, so if you have six stereo samples playing at one time, you\u2019ll hit that limit. My compositions aren\u2019t interesting enough to hit that threshold, but if you\u2019re a maximalist, then it\u2019s worth keeping in mind.\n\nA common technique to help avoid hitting the voice limit on other devices is resampling \u2014 basically merging separate sounds down into one new sample. This is also the technique for baking in any effects and modulation, which, given that the K.O. II can only manage one master effect at any one time makes the lack of resampling all the more obvious. Understandably, it\u2019s possibly the biggest complaint among users I\u2019ve seen so far (after fadergate of course).\n\nThere are ways around this, but it would involve recording out into another device and then sampling that back into the K.O. II and no one should have a sampler for their sampler, not in this economy. Teenage Engineering does have a decent track record of adding functionality via firmware updates \u2014 the company just added a new effect to the OP-1 Field as I wrote this \u2014 so fingers crossed.\n\nPhoto by James Trew / Engadget\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of features the K.O. II doesn\u2019t have, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of song mode. There are four sample \u201cgroups\u201d that you can think of as tracks (drums, bass, lead and so on). Each of these groups can hold up to 99 patterns and patterns can be up to 99 bars in length. The active patterns across the four groups can be saved as a \u201cscene\u201d and scenes can be triggered consecutively. But, importantly, there\u2019s no way for that to happen automatically right now. This means if you wanted to tease a whole recorded song out of the K.O. II you\u2019ll have to either get clever with MIDI or trigger scenes and patterns manually in real time.\n\nThis performative nature might be a burden for songs, but I found it to be a feature in other areas. On top of the master effects you also have 12 \u201cpunch in\u201d effects that can be applied \u2014 or punched in \u2014 by holding down the FX key and then any of the 12 black pads. Each is marked with its effect name (Level, Pitch and so on). These punch-in effects express themselves differently based on the amount of pressure you apply, making it a very expressive experience. The effects on these keys also correspond to modulation tools when used with the fader. So FX+7 adds the \u201cLevel\u201d punch-in effect (rhythmic gating) while Fader+7 will assign gain/level to the fader until you choose another modulator such as Attack or Low Pass Filter.\n\nI swear, half of the things you learn about how to use the K.O. II happen by accident. Yes, it\u2019s in the manual, but I discovered you can solo groups by pressing the FX button and the corresponding group. You can also press multiple buttons to \u201csolo\u201d multiple groups or sounds at the same time. With a group or group solo\u2019d you can then apply punch-in effects to create a lot of variations in real time. With so many touches like this, I am starting to assume that Teenage Engineering envisioned the K.O. II as a playful performative device rather than a linear song-making machine.\n\nPhoto by James Trew / Engadget\n\nI\u2019ve talked before about the sort of \u201cmagic\u201d factor that Teenage Engineering sometimes hides into its products. Just small, cute and often a bit hidden features that aren\u2019t necessary but are tons of fun. A common one is the inclusion of FM radio on the OP1/Field and OB 4 etc. Or the video making tool in the app for the OP-Z. There was a brief moment of excitement when I spotted \u201cloop mode from OB-4\u201d on the K.O. II\u2019s product page. The hope being the two devices would interact somehow, but it appears that\u2019s just a way of describing the looping feature that\u2019s been borrowed from the OB-4.\n\nAs I write these closing thoughts, the second official firmware update (v1.1.1) has just been released. There\u2019s nothing spicy in here like motion control or sampling the radio, but it\u2019s confirmation of what I mentioned earlier about Teenage Engineering adding features after a product hits the shelves \u2014 such as the OP-1 Field\u2019s vocoder synth that landed over six months after release or the fairly substantial 1.2.38 update for the OP-Z which came almost three years into its life.\n\nThe K.O. II represents an opportunity for Teenage Engineering to do the unthinkable and create a series of more capable instruments that don\u2019t cost Field-series levels of money. As a sampler, it\u2019s great for beginners or those who love a more performative style. It\u2019s not nearly as detailed and in-depth as something like Roland\u2019s SP 404 or Native Instruments\u2019 Maschine, but it was never going to be a rival to, well, anything really. Fadergate aside, this is a promising product from a company that has tested the loyalty of its fans more than usual in recent years.\n\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

    "body": "The PE (price to earnings ratio) of a stock is 18. Is that cheap or expensive? Well, it depends. On what? Many things! Welcome to the world of relative valuation.\n\nThe findings from research done a decade earlier by Aswath Damodaran indicated that around 85 per cent of valuation done by equity research analysts and 50 per cent of corporate M&A transactions were based on relative valuation. So, what exactly is this relative valuation?\n\nIt is the art of attempting to determine the fair value of a stock based on how it is valued relative to many factors. So, whether the PE of a stock is 15 or 18 or 30, the only way you can make an assessment of whether it is cheap or expensive is by analysing this one number \u2014 against its growth prospects, peer company multiples, industry trading range, historical average PE, the prevailing interest rates, etc.\n\nPortfolio podcast: The art of valuing stocks Portfolio podcast: The art of valuing stocks\n\nLet there be no doubt, valuation experts like Aswath Damodaran and many successful hedge fund managers believe that absolute valuation (which we discussed in the Big Story in bl.portfolio edition dated October 8) is the better way to arrive at the value of a stock.\n\nHowever, due to a combination of complexities involved in building appropriate models, insufficient information, time constraints and also the fact that there are hundreds of stocks you want to consider, it is just not possible to do a DCF ( discounted cash flow model) for all your stock investments, and hence relative valuation as an approach to picking stocks too is well accepted and widely prevalent.\n\nWhen you decide to buy or sell a stock based on its PE or P/B or EV/EBITDA or EV/Revenue or even EV/subscriber ratios, you are engaging in the art of relative valuation. And it\u2019s totally fine to be an investor relying on relative valuation to make your savings work for you, provided you approach it the right way and ensure adequate risk management. In relative valuation, the broader you assess the valuation, ie assess valuation multiple against more parameters, the better the perspective you get.\n\nIn simple words, one way to understand the difference between absolute valuation (explained in last week\u2019s edition) and relative valuation is this \u2013 absolute valuation is made up of an interesting story that is backed by credible and validated numbers, while relative valuation is made up of an interesting number backed by a credible and validated story.\n\nWhat are those numbers in relative valuation? Every number in relative valuation is the result of a number A divided by a number B. For example, PE is price of the stock divided by its earnings. These are all numbers that are used to compare against similar metrics of other stocks and assess the merits of the stock.\n\nBefore we proceed on using relative valuation to pick stocks, it is important to understand that you can do relative valuation using equity multiples or firm/enterprise multiples.\n\nEquity multiples\n\nIf you check the balance sheet of any company, the liabilities side is primarily made up of two line items \u2014 shareholder funds and borrowings. To the contrary, a Profit and Loss statement has many line items \u2014 starting with revenue, followed by variable costs and then fixed costs and taxes. The only claim that equity shareholders have for distribution or for appropriation amongst themselves is what is left after paying the taxes \u2014 net profit.\n\nSo, if you are doing relative valuation based on equity multiples, it is important to ensure you divide the equity \u2013 ie price per share or market cap of the company by line items that apply to equity shareholders.\n\nBased on this, there are only 3 items that can be attributed to equity shareholders \u2014 net profit from P&L statement, book value or shareholder funds from the Balance Sheet, and the free cash flows to equity (FCFE) from the cash flow statement. Any relative valuation multiples will be linked to these three items one way or the other. Any other metric could be wrong and misleading.\n\nFor example, price by revenue or price by EBITDA is incorrect. Why? How do you differentiate between two companies A and B \u2014 both having same market cap of \u20b9100 and similar in all means except for debt levels \u2014 same revenue (\u20b9100) and same gross margin and same EBITDA margins of 20 per cent and thus same EBITDA of \u20b920. But A has zero debt, while B has debt of \u20b910. Since revenue or sales and EBITDA are same, if you do a market cap/revenue or Price /Sales, or marketcap/EBITDA, both companies will have the same valuation.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s assume depreciation is \u20b910, interest cost is 10 per cent and taxes are zero. This means the net profit of A is \u20b910, while that of B is \u20b99. Thus although both companies are similar in terms of Price/Revenue and Price/EBITDA, A is cheaper on the PE ratio \u2013 ie PE of A is 10 and PE of B is 11.1. On a relative valuation basis, you must choose A instead of B, but you would not have spotted it if you had used incorrect metrics.\n\nHence it\u2019s very important to use the right multiples. When it comes to equity metrics, it always has to be price or market cap (or variations of the same) in numerator divided by line items attributable to equity holders (or variations of the same)\n\nThe accompanying table gives the commonly used equity multiples for relative valuation.\n\nOnce the metrics and importance are understood, there are, as such, no limits to how you can use them to pick stocks. You can use one or two metrics or a combination of many more metrics to assess which stocks are undervalued or overvalued.\n\nDepending on specific cases, you can use further variations to pick stocks. For example, during the 2003-2007 bull market, many textile stocks, for instance, Bombay Dyeing, turned out to be multibaggers. Was their textile business booming? Not really. But the stocks were zooming because there was real estate boom and many textile mills had manufacturing facilities in prime real estate locations. So the markets started to factor value of the company based on market value of their land. In such a case you can deviate from Price/Book multiple to price/market value of net assets (assets \u2013 net debt).\n\nSimilar is the case with holding companies. If you think there is a reasonable case for underlying value of assets to be unlocked and Holdco discount to shrink, like it has happened in bank holding companies in the last 2-3 years, then there is a case to move beyond book value to market value.\n\nEnterprise value multiples\n\nEnterprise value refers to total value of a company/business. This total value as perceived by the market is represented by the sum of its market cap + net debt (includes minority interest). What works in the case of EV is that it helps in doing a capital-agnostic analysis of a company. Whether a company is funded only with equity, or a combination of equity and debt, the total value of the business is the same. Sources of funding don\u2019t matter.\n\nUsing EV, the value of equity (share price) is derived from the value of the business. Since the capital structure of companies varies significantly, an EV approach enables valuing them on similar terms. One can arrive at the value of the business first and then subtract net debt, to arrive at the equity value. The advantage with EV-based metrics is that you have more options to value a company.\n\nBear in mind, valuation accuracy is better the lower down the P&L and cash flow statement one can get to. But there are many times when company profits are low, but its operational performance ie EBITDA is not bad. In such cases, as revenue and EBITDA continue to grow, operating leverage will result in PE growing much faster than the above two line items.\n\nFor example, take the case of Bharti Airtel: at the start of FY22 (April \u201821) its trailing PE was negative/invalid due to losses in FY21. The stock would have been avoided if one went by PE alone. However, on trailing EV/EBITDA basis, it was trading at 10 times EV/EBITDA. When this was considered against its estimated next 2 years EBITDA CAGR of over 20 per cent, the valuation, combined with qualitative factors, made it an interesting buy. Since then, net profits have improved substantially as operating leverage played out.\n\nAt bl.portfolio we had recommended a buy on the stock based on this in April 2021 and the stock has returned 80 per cent since. The stock would have been easily missed if PE was the metric used to spot the performers.\n\nHence EV-based metrics are options to consider as well when equity-based valuation multiples do not give a clear picture. Where even EBITDA multiples are not clear, as was the case with many new-age company IPOs that were reporting losses even at the EBITDA level, investors have no option but to go further up the P&L to metrics like EV/revenue, or even outside of P&L to use metrics like EV/subscriber.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, relative valuation represents a number backed by a credible and well-validated story. Hence, you can use non-P&L multiples. So when you compare companies and invest in one based on EV/Subscriber, there must be a credible story backing future monetisation of the subscriber in a profitable manner. But do bear in mind, the risks are higher and so may be the rewards or pain as the case may be. When the risks are higher, you must apply a higher margin of safety before choosing the stock.\n\nAnother thing to bear in mind when it comes to EV-based valuation \u2014 any change in EV will impact only the equity value. For example, if EV of a company is \u20b9100 and it has \u20b950 in debt, then the value of its equity is \u20b950. In this case, if you think EV can increase by 10 per cent, the value of equity will increase by 20 per cent, and the reverse is also true. The higher the leverage, more the impact of change in EV on the value of the stock (both ways).\n\nKeep a weather eye on Ketchup Economics\n\nGiven the fact that relative valuation is based on comparison with peer multiples, investors must take measures to check whether the peer multiples are reasonable as well. An overvalued peer cannot be used to justify expensive valuation in one stock. This is what economist Larry Summers termed as Ketchup economists/economics. It was his sarcastic take on some of the highly paid economists and finance professionals who are concerned only with inter-relationships between prices of different financial assets. Based on this approach, they conclude whether the price of an asset independently is efficient or not. If two bottles of ketchup sell for twice as much as one bottle (except for minor differences traceable to transaction costs), the market is efficient.\n\nThe risk in this \u2013 it ignores the aspect of whether one bottle of ketchup is priced rationally. Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman once explained how the US housing bubble that precipitated the global financial crisis reminded him of ketchup economists. Before purchasing a house during the bubble, buyers carefully compared prices with \u2018prices of other houses\u2019, but ignored whether the overall level of a home price made sense.\n\nHow to avoid pitfalls\n\nSo, what can you do to avoid pitfalls while using relative valuation? Here are a few pointers.\n\nOne, after comparing stocks based on relative valuation, you can do more layers of comparison by assessing how their valuation fares relative to growth prospects. This apart, many other factors can justify different valuations. For example, TCS has always commanded a valuation premium to peer stocks like Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech because of its superior margins and much more consistent growth. So just because the other stocks are cheaper on PE basis does not mean they are cheap compared to TCS. So you can also do one more layer of comparison by assessing each company\u2019s valuation against its long-term (5-10 years) mean and median valuations and assess how they fare relative to their own history.\n\nTwo, equity valuations do not function in a silo. Investors have many options \u2014 fixed deposits, bonds, real estate, etc. When other assets get more attractive one must assess scope for valuation change in equities as well. For example, interest rates and bond yields in many developed markets, including the US, are at their highest levels since 2007. This means investors may have to assess current valuations not just against last 10 years\u2019 valuations, but of prior periods as well.\n\nWhy? Near zero interest rates and low bond yields made stocks with earnings yield of mere 1-2 per cent attractive for an FPI \u2014 for example stocks such as Asian Paints, Nestle India and ABB India which today trade at PE of 65, 83 and 85 times respectively. This implies earnings yield of 1.5 per cent for Asian Paints and 1.2 per cent for Nestle and ABB. Such earnings yields of these stocks were fine for FPIs to hold when compared to zero interest income in their domestic market. But now, with US bond yields offering 5 per cent, these may not be so attractive even when considering the growth prospects. While Indian interest rates were always higher, investors in equities benefited from the global investors\u2019 hunger for yields. That advantage is diminishing today. This is not a recommendation on the stocks, but pointers on factors to consider to make your relative valuation process more foolproof.\n\nWith discipline and experience, the process will keep getting better."

    "body": "Greg Marcus has been in the movie business for years but he never expected to be urging moviegoers to take out their phones during a film \u2014 let alone to be crafting friendship bracelets in preparation for an opening weekend.\n\nBut there the chief executive and chair of the Marcus Corporation is in a promotion for his theater chain headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, stringing beads together while humming \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nMovie theaters are readying for an onslaught like they\u2019ve never seen before, beginning Friday when \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d debuts. The concert film, compiled from several Swift shows at Southern California\u2019s SoFi Stadium, is expected to launch with $100 million, or possibly more. Advance ticket sales worldwide have already surpassed $100 million.\n\nSwifties will descend. Dancing will be encouraged.\n\n\u201cThis is different,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cTake your phone out. Take selfies. Dance, sing, get up, have a good time. We want to create an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nConcert films, of course, aren\u2019t anything new. Just last month, the Talking Heads classic \u201cStop Making Sense\u201d returned to theaters for a decades-later encore. But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d heralds something new and potentially game-changing in the movie industry.\n\nTwo of the biggest stars on the planet \u2014 Swift and , in December under a very similar arrangement, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 are heading into cinemas in first-of-their-kind deals made directly with AMC Theaters that circumvent Hollywood studios and which, for now, leave streamers waiting on the sidelines.\n\nBut how did the once declared-for-dead multiplex become the go-to place this fall a pair of stars previously at home on Netflix?\n\nWhen studios began diverting some of their titles to streaming platforms, movie theaters began thinking harder about how they could fill their screens \u2014 a question exacerbated this autumn by an actors strike that\u2019s led to the postponement of big releases like \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d\n\nMovie theaters are increasingly not just a marquee of movie showtimes but a big-screen stage for a variety of visual media. BTS earlier this year released a concert film, with higher ticket prices and limited showtimes. The Metropolitan Opera has for years done popular live broadcasts in theaters.\n\nFew acts can do what Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 can. Their expected success is unlikely to be replicated. But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d could be the start of an expansion of what, exactly, a movie theater can be. Think the Sphere, only much cheaper and in most towns.\n\n\u201cYou could say we\u2019re in the movie business, but really we\u2019re in the getting-together-with-other-people business,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cThe more we do of it, the more the customers will think about it and the more talent will go: This is something I could do.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s camp was motivated to get the film out even as her stadium tour continues internationally. The tour, which is projected by Pollstar to gross some $1.4 billion, crashed Ticketmaster\u2019s site, saw sky-high resale mark-ups and left many fans priced out.\n\nThe movie, directed by Sam Wrench, would be a way for millions more to experience the Eras Tour. Adult tickets are being sold for $19.89, a reference to her birth year and 2014 album, a re-recording of which is due out Oct. 27. That\u2019s higher than the average movie ticket but several thousand less than many tickets to see Swift live.\n\nIt\u2019s arriving uncommonly fast, too, just a little over two months since the SoFi shows. Speed was one reason Swift\u2019s father, Scott Swift, is said to have sought out a direct deal with AMC. Swift produced the film, herself, and, with 274 million followers on Instagram, didn\u2019t need a studio to promote it.\n\nThe pop star\u2019s apparent relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has only further brightened the spotlight on the movie. According to ad tracking firm iSpot, TV ads for the film ran only a few dozen times as of Oct. 6, including several spots during NFL broadcasts. (A Marvel movie, by comparison, might run several thousand TV commercials.)\n\nTicket sales will be split 43% with theaters and 57% shared by Swift and AMC \u2014 with the lion\u2019s share of that going to Swift. The film will play exclusively in theaters for at least 13 weeks \u2014 longer than many Hollywood releases do now. AMC CEO Adam Aron has called the deal \u201ca coup for AMC\u201d on social media.\n\nBoth AMC and representatives for Swift declined to discuss the film\u2019s release.\n\nAfter a premiere in Los Angeles on Wednesday, there won\u2019t be any advance screenings until the movie begins playing at 6 p.m. local time Friday. Most wide-release movies open with Thursday showings and Friday daytime screenings. It\u2019s another wrinkle in a nontraditional release that\u2019s challenging Hollywood norms.\n\n\u201cInnovation comes out of challenging times in this business. We\u2019re seeing a lot of changes, some subtle, some not so subtle,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \u201cIt seems like, right now, there are no rules when it comes to being successful.\u201d\n\nDergarabedian believes the two concert films should help lift the North American box office to more than $9 billion in 2023, up from the $7.4 billion of last year and edging closer to the $11.4 billion of 2019.\n\n\u201cIt really opens up the idea that other types of content can play really well in a movie theater,\u201d he says.\n\nSome of those changes have been facilitated by the abolishment of long-held antitrust restrictions governing movie distribution. After more than 70 years of regulating divisions between exhibition and distribution, the Paramount consent decrees were terminated in 2020 at the urging of the Department of Justice, with a two-year sunset period that ran until last year.\n\n\u201cInnovation had effectively been stunted,\u201d says Makan Delrahim, the former antitrust chief at the Justice Department who proposed ending the consent decrees.\n\nDelrahim believes \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d \u2014 as a movie distributed by a theater chain, with nontraditional ticket prices \u2014 could \u201cfuel new business models to save the exhibitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be more appetite to experiment different models for theatrical distribution,\u201d Delrahim says. \u201cThe industry needs it and, frankly, so do consumers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is poised to become the biggest concert film ever in about two days of release. Not accounting for inflation, 2011\u2019s \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d holds that mark with $73.1 million across its entire run. Accounting for inflation, it will be harder for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d to catch \u201cWoodstock,\u201d which grossed $50 million in 1970, a total that translates to nearly $400 million today.\n\nIn Marcus\u2019 theaters, like many other chains, there will be friendship bracelet stations. Sound systems have been modified for more of a concert feel. And while Marcus grants it will be strange to see an AMC logo before a film playing in his theaters, he doesn\u2019t particularly mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy it\u2019s there,\u201d he says."

    "body": "For the next few weeks, TechCrunch\u2019s robotics newsletter Actuator will be running Q&As with some of the top minds in robotics. Subscribe here for future updates.\n\nPart 1: CMU\u2019s Matthew Johnson-Roberson\n\nPart 2: Toyota Research Institute\u2019s Max Bajracharya and Russ Tedrake\n\nPart 3: Meta\u2019s Dhruv Batra\n\nThis time it\u2019s Boston Dynamics CTO, Aaron Saunders. He has been with the company for more than 20 years, most recently serving as its vice president of Engineering.\n\nWhat role(s) will generative AI play in the future of robotics?\n\nThe current rate of change makes it hard to predict very far into the future. Foundation models represent a major shift in how the best machine learning models are created, and we are already seeing some impressive near-term accelerations in natural language interfaces. They offer opportunities to create conversational interfaces to our robots, improve the quality of existing computer vision functions and potentially enable new customer-facing capabilities such as visual question answering. Ultimately we feel these more scalable architectures and training strategies are likely to extend past language and vision into robotic planning and control. Being able to interpret the world around a robot will lead to a much richer understanding on how to interact with it. It\u2019s a really exciting time to be a roboticist!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the humanoid form factor?\n\nHumanoids aren\u2019t necessarily the best form factor for all tasks. Take Stretch, for example \u2014 we originally generated interest in a box-moving robot from a video we shared of Atlas moving boxes. Just because humans can move boxes doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re the best form factor to complete that task, and we ultimately designed a custom robot in Stretch that can move boxes more efficiently and effectively than a human. With that said, we see great potential in the long-term pursuit of general-purpose robotics, and the humanoid form factor is the most obvious match to a world built around our form. We have always been excited about the potential of humanoids and are working hard to close the technology gap.\n\nFollowing manufacturing and warehouses, what is the next major category for robotics?\n\nThose two industries still stand out when you look at matching up customer needs with the state of art in technology. As we fan out, I think we will move slowly from environments that have determinism to those with higher levels of uncertainty. Once we see broad adoption in automation-friendly industries like manufacturing and logistics, the next wave probably happens in areas like construction and healthcare. Sectors like these are compelling opportunities because they have large workforces and high demand for skilled labor, but the supply is not meeting the need. Combine that with the work environments, which sit between the highly structured industrial setting and the totally unstructured consumer market, and it could represent a natural next step along the path to general purpose.\n\nHow far out are true general-purpose robots?\n\nThere are many hard problems standing between today and truly general-purpose robots. Purpose-built robots have become a commodity in the industrial automation world, but we are just now seeing the emergence of multi-purpose robots. To be truly general purpose, robots will need to navigate unstructured environments and tackle problems they have not encountered. They will need to do this in a way that builds trust and delights the user. And they will have to deliver this value at a competitive price point. The good news is that we are seeing an exciting increase in critical mass and interest in the field. Our children are exposed to robotics early, and recent graduates are helping us drive a massive acceleration of technology. Today\u2019s challenge of delivering value to industrial customers is paving the way toward tomorrow\u2019s consumer opportunity and the general purpose future we all dream of.\n\nWill home robots (beyond vacuums) take off in the next decade?\n\nWe may see additional introduction of robots into the home in the next decade, but for very limited and specific tasks (like Roomba, we will find other clear value cases in our daily lives). We\u2019re still more than a decade away from multifunctional in-home robots that deliver value to the broad consumer market. When would you pay as much for a robot as you would a car? When it achieves the same level of dependability and value you have come to take for granted in the amazing machines we use to transport us around the world.\n\nWhat important robotics story/trend isn\u2019t getting enough coverage?\n\nThere is a lot of enthusiasm around AI and its potential to change all industries, including robotics. Although it has a clear role and may unlock domains that have been relatively static for decades, there is a lot more to a good robotic product than 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. For AI to achieve the physical embodiment we need to interact with the world around us, we need to track progress in key technologies like computers, perception sensors, power sources and all the other bits that make up a full robotic system. The recent pivot in automotive towards electrification and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is quickly transforming a massive supply chain. Progress in graphics cards, computers and increasingly sophisticated AI-enabled consumer electronics continues to drive value into adjacent supply chains. This massive snowball of technology, rarely in the spotlight, is one of the most exciting trends in robotics because it enables small innovative companies to stand on the backs of giants to create new and exciting products."

    "body": "Building a robot that\u2019s both human-like and useful is a decades-old engineering dream inspired by popular science fiction.\n\nWhile the latest artificial intelligence craze has sparked another wave of investments in the quest to build a humanoid, most of the current prototypes are clumsy and impractical, looking better in staged performances than in real life. That hasn\u2019t stopped a handful of startups from keeping at it.\n\n\u201cThe intention is not to start from the beginning and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re trying to make a robot look like a person,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Hurst, co-founder and chief robot officer at Agility Robotics. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make robots that can operate in human spaces.\u201d\n\nDo we even need humanoids? Hurst makes a point of describing Agility\u2019s warehouse robot Digit as human-centric, not humanoid, a distinction meant to emphasize what it does over what it\u2019s trying to be.\n\nWhat it does, for now, is pick up tote bins and move them. Amazon announced in October it will begin testing Digits for use in its warehouses, and Agility opened an Oregon factory in September to mass produce them.\n\nDigit has a head containing cameras, other sensors and animated eyes, and a torso that essentially works as its engine. It has two arms and two legs, but its legs are more bird-like than human, with an inverted knees appearance that resembles so-called digitigrade animals such as birds, cats and dogs that walk on their toes rather than on flat feet.\n\nRival robot-makers, like Figure AI, are taking a more purist approach on the idea that only true humanoids can effectively navigate workplaces, homes and a society built for humans. Figure also plans to start with a relatively simple use case, such as in a retail warehouse, but aims for a commercial robot that can be \u201citerated on like an iPhone\u201d to perform multiple tasks to take up the work of humans as birth rates decline around the world.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough people doing these jobs, so the market\u2019s massive,\u201d said Figure AI CEO Brett Adcock. \u201cIf we can just get humanoids to do work that humans are not wanting to do because there\u2019s a shortfall of humans, we can sell millions of humanoids, billions maybe.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, however, Adcock\u2019s firm doesn\u2019t have a prototype that\u2019s ready for market. Founded just over a year ago and after having raised tens of millions of dollars, it recently revealed a 38-second video of Figure walking through its test facility in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is also trying to build a humanoid, called Optimus, through the electric car-maker\u2019s robotics division, but a hyped-up live demonstration last year of the robot\u2019s awkwardly halting steps didn\u2019t impress experts in the robotics field. Seemingly farther along is Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas-based neighbor Apptronik, which unveiled its Apollo humanoid in an August video demonstration.\n\nAll the attention \u2014 and money \u2014 poured into making ungainly humanoid machines might make the whole enterprise seem like a futile hobby for wealthy technologists, but for some pioneers of legged robots it\u2019s all about what you learn along the way.\n\n\u201cNot only about their design and operation, but also about how people respond to them, and about the critical underlying technologies for mobility, dexterity, perception and intelligence,\u201d said Marc Raibert, the co-founder of Boston Dynamics, best known for its dog-like robots named Spot.\n\nRaibert said sometimes the path of development is not along a straight line. Boston Dynamics, now a subsidiary of carmaker Hyundai, experimented with building a humanoid that could handle boxes.\n\n\u201cThat led to development of a new robot that was not really a humanoid, but had several characteristics of a humanoid,\u201d he said via an emailed message. \u201cBut the changes resulted in a new robot that could handle boxes faster, could work longer hours, and could operate in tight spaces, such as a truck. So humanoid research led to a useful non-humanoid robot.\u201d\n\nSome startups aiming for human-like machines focused on improving the dexterity of robotic fingers before trying to get their robots to walk.\n\nWalking is \u201cnot the hardest problem to solve in humanoid robotics,\u201d said Geordie Rose, co-founder and CEO of British Columbia, Canada-based startup Sanctuary AI. \u201cThe hardest problem is the problem of understanding the world and being able to manipulate it with your hands.\u201d\n\nSanctuary\u2019s newest and first bipedal robot, Phoenix, can stock shelves, unload delivery vehicles and operate a checkout, early steps toward what Rose sees as a much longer-term goal of getting robots to perceive the physical world to be able to reason about it in a way that resembles intelligence. Like other humanoids, it\u2019s meant to look endearing, because how it interacts with real people is a big part of its function.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to provide labor to the world, not just for one thing, but for everybody who needs it,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe systems have to be able to think like people. So we could call that artificial general intelligence if you\u2019d like. But what I mean more specifically is the systems have to be able to understand speech and they need to be able to convert the understanding of speech into action, which will satisfy job roles across the entire economy.\u201d\n\nAgility\u2019s Digit robot caught Amazon\u2019s attention because it can walk and also move around in a way that could complement the e-commerce giant\u2019s existing fleet of vehicle-like robots that move large carts around its vast warehouses.\n\n\u201cThe mobility aspect is more interesting than the actual form,\u201d said Tye Brady, Amazon\u2019s chief technologist for robotics, after the company showed it off at a media event in Seattle.\n\nRight now, Digit is being tested to help with the repetitive task of picking up and moving empty totes. But just having it there is bound to resurrect some fears about robots taking people\u2019s jobs, a narrative Amazon is trying to prevent from taking hold.\n\nAgility Robotics co-founder and CEO Damion Shelton said the warehouse robot is \u201cjust the first use case\u201d of a new generation of robots he hopes will be embraced rather than feared as they prepare to enter businesses and homes.\n\n\u201cSo in 10, 20 years, you\u2019re going to see these robots everywhere,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cForever more, human- centric robots like that are going to be part of human life. So that\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\n\u2014-\n\nAP writer Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report."

The trade market is also expected to be active once more dominoes fall, with Dylan Cease, Corbin Burnes and Tyler Glasnow among starters who could be moved this winter.\n\nThe Winter Meetings are over, but because of the timeline of major decisions by Ohtani and Yamamoto, there could be a flurry of activity leading up to the end of the year.\n\nMORE: Why Shohei Ohtani signed with Dodgers over Blue Jays, other suitors\n\nSporting News is tracking the rumors, signings and trades as MLB free agency continues. Follow along below for the latest news.\n\nMLB free agency tracker, live updates\n\nPadres ink five-year deal with NPB star Matsui\n\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 23\n\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nAnother Japanese star is headed to the Sunshine State. Star reliever Yuki Matsui inked a five-year, $28 million deal to join the Friars on Saturday. Matsui was one of NPB's best arms out the pen, starring for Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles for nearly a decade. He tallied up 236 saves over the course of his career, posting a 2.40 ERA in 659.2 innings of work. The contract features opt-out clauses in Years 4 and 5, offering San Diego an out if Matsui deals with elbow trouble.\n\nDodgers sign Yamamoto to $325 million contract\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\n\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan, YES Network's Jack Curry\n\nThe Yamamoto sweepstakes are over, as the Dodgers have reportedly signed the Japanese ace to a 12-year, $325 million. It's the largest MLB deal for a pitcher, surpassing Gerrit Cole's deal with the Yankees by $1 million. Los Angeles' incredible offseason continues, as Yamamoto joins Shohei Ohtani on the defending NL West champs.\n\nGiants out of Yamamoto sweepstakes\n\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 21\n\nSource: Alex Pavlovic, NBC Sports Bay Area\n\nThe Giants made a hard push to land Yamamoto, but according to NBC Sports Bay Area's Alex Pavlovic, San Francisco has been notified that the team is out of the bidding to land the Japanese ace. Pavlovic added that it is very likely that Yamamoto ends up either in Los Angeles with the Dodgers, or New York with the Mets or Yankees.\n\nYamamoto met with Giants, won't decide on team until after Christmas\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\n\nSource: Andrew Baggarly, The Athletic and Bob Klapisch, Newark Star-Ledger\n\nSan Francisco has been among the teams most heavily believed to be in on Yamamoto, and according to The Athletic's Andrew Baggarly, the team met with him in San Francisco last week. Baggarly reported the Giants have been willing to \"blow teams out of the water\" to land Yamamoto, but noted he believes the crowded picture for the Japanese ace could make it more challenging for the Giants to be the winner of the Yamamoto sweepstakes.\n\nAnd fans will have to wait a bit longer before hearing a final resolution on his decision. The Newark Star-Ledger's Bob Klapisch reported Yamamoto isn't expected to make a decision until after Christmas, and that it could run until around Jan. 1-4.\n\nPirates re-sign franchise legend Andrew McCutchen\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\n\nSource: Jason Mackey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nThe Pirates have been making a few veteran free-agent signings to bolster the rotation. Now, they're bringing back a franchise icon. Pittsburgh has reportedly inked Andrew McCutchen to a one-year, $5 million.\n\nMcCutchen enjoyed a solid return to Pittsburgh in 2023, slashing .256/.378/.397 with 12 home runs in 112 games. It was his first season in Pittsburgh since 2017.\n\nAngels discussing Blake Snell\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nThe Angels came up empty on bringing back Ohtani. Now, they're looking to land another splashy name on the free-agent market. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported Los Angeles has had discussions with two-time Cy Young winner Blake Snell.\n\nPer Morosi, the Angels are not believed to be a strong contender for Yamamoto, thus allowing them to put more of an effort on landing Snell rather than waiting for Yamamoto to make a decision.\n\nCody Bellinger looking for package starting at $200 million\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 18\n\nSource: Jesse Rogers, ESPN\n\nWith Ohtani signed to Los Angeles, Bellinger remains the top free-agent bat on the market. And he is clearly looking for a top-of-the-market contract. Rogers reported sources indicate Bellinger's agent, Scott Boras, is seeking a deal worth well over $200 million for Bellinger, with one source saying he is \"not budging.\"\n\nRogers went on to note that some believe the Cubs won't be a team willing to pay a player that type of money until he's 40 years old, while a team like the Blue Jays might given their desperation to round out the roster.\n\nPadres closing in on contract for Yuki Matsui\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 18\n\nSource: Yuki Yamada, Sankei Sports\n\nThe Padres are nearing a deal for one of the top Japanese pitchers on the market. Per Sankei Sports' Yuki Yamada, the Padres are \"close to signing\" Rakuten Golden Eagles' reliever Yuki Matsui to a deal. In 10 years in Nippon Professional Baseball, Matsui has a 2.40 ERA across 659.2 innings of work.

The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reported San Francisco has agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract with the Giants. Murphy appeared in only 47 games for the Mariners in 2023, but had a standout year at the plate, slashing .290/.335/.538 with eight home runs. He joins a catching room that also features breakout 2023 rookie Patrick Bailey and Joey Bart. Bart is out of minor-league options, and could be on the outside-looking-in to a 2024 Opening Day roster spot if the Giants decide to have only two catchers on the active roster.\n\nPirates add to rotation, sign Martin Perez\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\n\nSource: Jason Mackey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nPittsburgh continues to add to its rotation this offseason.

The Pirates also added another left-hander who pitched in 2023 for an AL West team in Marco Gonzales, though he had an offseason stop in Atlanta in the middle.\n\nBidding for Yamamoto begins Monday\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation about offers sent over to Yamamoto to this point, but Passan reports he has yet to receiver any formal offers. However, that will start to change on Monday, with the bidding slated to begin.\n\nBraves cut Matt Carpenter after trying to trade him\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\n\nSource: Robert Murray, FanSided\n\nAtlanta reportedly was hoping to trade Matt Carpenter after acquiring him in a deal earlier this offseason from the Padres. The team acquired him and took on $4 million along with trading for Ray Kerr, but was looking to deal away his contract to someone else, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal.\n\nTwins could trade Max Kepler, Jorge Polance\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 17\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nThe Twins are coming off an AL Central title, but could be looking to deal away two of their key players form the team. Max Kepler and Jorge Polanco could both reportedly be on the trade market, per MLB Network's Jon Morosi, though their market could hinge on the status of other infield free agents.\n\nKepler appeared in 130 games for the Twins, and posted an impressive .260/.332/.484 slash line with 24 homers for Minnesota. Polanco was moved to an infield utility role with Edouard Julien and Royce Lewis emerging into regulars, but was still solid in 80 games, logging a .255/.335/.454 slash with 14 homers.\n\nYamamoto requests meeting with Yankees\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 17\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nYamamoto has been making the rounds with MLB teams, and per Heyman, he reportedly asked to meet with the Yankees for a second time. The meeting with New York comes a day after he met with the Mets at team owner Steve Cohen's Connecticut home.\n\nLourdes Gurriel Jr. re-signs with Diamondbacks\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 17\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nThe Diamondbacks acquired Lourdes Gurriel Jr. last offseason in a trade involving Daulton Varsho and Gabriel Moreno. And after helping Arizona get to the World Series, Gurriel is ready to come back to Arizona.

Cohen and other top Mets officials previously flew to Japan to meet with Yamamoto on his home turf, so this is at least the second time the key players have met face-to-face.\n\nSherman reports the bidding process for the 25-year-old \"is supposed to intensify this week,\" with the Yankees, Dodgers, Giants, Red Sox, Phillies and Blue Jays also in the mix.\n\nRoyals sign pair of veterans\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 15\n\nSource: MLB.com's Anne Rogers\n\nThe Royals continue to splurge in the offseason. Per MLB.com's Anne Rogers, Kansas City signed outfielder Hunter Renfroe to a one-year, $5.5 million deal with a player option for 2025 worth $7.5 million, as well as right-hander Michael Wacha to a two-year, $32 million deal with an opt-out after 2024.\n\nThe moves are the latest for the Royals, who already signed Seth Lugo, Will Smith and Garrett Hampson this offseason. The total commitments are now up to $82 million.\n\nTyler Glansow inks extension with Dodgers\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 15\n\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nThe only question mark left in the Glasnow trade was the figures on the extension he'd wind up signing with the Dodgers. Now, the numbers are in, and the deal is set to be completed.\n\nPer Passan, Glasnow will be signing a five-year, $135 million deal with the Dodgers. Passan reported the deal begins in 2024, and could reach up to $145 million if the Dodgers pick up a $30 million option at the end of the contract. He also reported that unlike Ohtani's deal, there will be no deferred money.\n\nTyler Glasnow traded to Dodgers from Rays\n\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 14\n\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nAs had been reported for a few days, the deal between the Dodgers and Rays for Tyler Glasnow is coming to fruition. Los Angeles has reportedly acquired the right-handed starting pitcher, along with outfielder Manuel Margot, for RHP Ryan Pepiot and OF Jonny Deluca.\n\nGlasnow is expected to sign a contract extension with the Dodgers as a result of the trade. The 30-year-old is in the final year of a two-year deal he sinked with the Rays in 2023, and was set to be free agent in 2025.\n\nJack Flaherty signs with Tigers\n\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 14\n\nSource:ESPN's Jeff Passan\n\nJack Flaherty has a new home. The right hander is signing a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers, according to Passan.\n\nAfter undergoing shoulder surgery in 2022, Flaherty was traded from the Cardinals to the Orioles last year at the 2023 deadline. In total, he made 27 starts last year, posting a 4.99 ERA with 148 strikeouts in 144.1 innings.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto meets with Phillies\n\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 14\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nThe Phillies have not been one of the more frequent names connected to Yamamoto, however the Japanese free agent reportedly met with the team. The starting pitcher has met with a number of teams, including the Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Red Sox.\n\nPhiladelphia re-signed ace Aaron Nola this offseason, bringing back the powerful duo of Nola and Zack Wheeler. Adding Yamamoto would immediately give the Phillies' one of the best rotations in baseball.\n\nCubs, Blue Jays the favorites for Cody Bellinger\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 13\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nThe Blue Jays and Cubs were believed to be among the favorites to land Ohtani. But with the star two-way talent off to Los Angeles, the two are now believed to be the favorites to land Cody Bellinger, according to Heyman.\n\nBellinger would be returning to the Cubs, the team with which he rebuilt his value after a down year with the Dodgers. If he signed with the Blue Jays, he'd be bringing the powerful left-handed bat the team sought when it pursued Ohtani.\n\nDodgers send stars to meet with Yamamoto\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 13\n\nSource: Fabian Ardaya, The Athletic\n\nThe Dodgers added one Japanese star this offseason. They're now looking to add another. Los Angeles reportedly sent Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith to meet with Yamamoto, trying to convince the standout starting pitcher to join the National League superpower.\n\nSigning Yamamoto would be a major boost for the Dodgers, who still have a need at starting pitcher.\n\nRays-Dodgers working on a Tyler Glasnow trade\n\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 13\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\n\nThe Rays and Dodgers are reportedly working on a trade that would send starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow to L.A. Rosenthal reports that the proposed deal would also include OF Manny Margot going to the Dodgers, while the Rays would receive RHP Ryan Pepiot and OF Jonny Deluca.\n\nRosenthal clarified that the deal is not complete and changes are possible, but the base of the deal is Glasnow to the Dodgers.\n\nRowdy Tellez inks one-year deal with Pirates\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\n\nSource: Robert Murray, FanSided\n\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $3.2 million contract with Rowdy Tellez. The deal includes an additional $800,000 in incentives.\n\nTellez hit 35 home runs as a centerpiece of the Brewers' lineup in 2022, but he took a significant step back in 2023 after starting the season on a roll. Between first base and the DH role, however, the Pirates figure to give Tellez near-everyday playing time in hopes his power bat finds its form.\n\nGiants, Jung-Hoo Lee agree to six-year deal\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nThe Giants have struggled to land big-name free agents over the last two offseasons, but they reeled in a pretty significant fish on Tuesday by inking Korean outfielder Jung-Hoo Lee to a six-year, $113M contract. Lee can opt out after 2027.\n\nLee is just 25 and was an on-base machine in Korea, batting .340 in his KBO career. While his power was inconsistent between seasons, Lee was a sought-after bat in free agency and drew heavy interest from the Padres as well.\n\nDodgers meeting with Yamamoto on Tuesday\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\n\nSource: Russell Dorsey, Bally Sports\n\nBally Sports' Russell Dorsey reports the Dodgers met with Yoshinobu Yamamoto on Tuesday, extending Yamamoto's free agent four.\n\nYamamoto has already met with four teams and still plans to meet with the Red Sox and Blue Jays in the coming days.\n\nRoyals finalizing deal with SP Seth Lugo\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\n\nSource: Anne Rogers, MLB.com\n\nThe Royals and starter Seth Lugo are finalizing a 3-year, $45 million contract, according to MLB.com's Anne Rogers.\n\nThe Padres stretched Lugo back into a full-time starter in 2023, and the 34-year-old posted a 3.57 ERA across 146.1 innings. Kansas City can use plenty of rotation help after a dismal 2023 season, so Lugo figures to be one of the Royals' top arms in 2024 and perhaps beyond.\n\nYamamoto to meet with Red Sox, Blue Jays\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\n\nSource: Mark Feinsand, MLB.com\n\nMLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto will meet with both the Red Sox and Blue Jays in the coming days.\n\nYamamoto has already met with the Mets, Giants and Yankees, with the Dodgers also believed to be involved in the bidding. With both meetings still upcoming, the report is an indication the Yamamoto sweepstakes aren't on the verge of a conclusion.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best fits for Japanese star Yoshinobu Yamamoto\n\nDodgers formally announce Ohtani signing\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 11\n\nSource: Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nThe Dodgers have officially announced their signing of Ohtani, calling him a \"once-in-a-generation talent and one of the most exciting professional athletes in the world.\"\n\n\"Dodger fans, thank you for welcoming me to your team.

The Giants have missed out on some of the most prominent free agents over the last two offseasons, so there might be incentive to make Yamamoto a massive offer to try and stay relevant in the NL West after the Dodgers' Ohtani signing.\n\nMORE: What to know about Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto as he moves to MLB\n\nRoyals agree to 1-year deal with reliever Will Smith\n\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 10\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nThe Royals have agreed to a 1-year, $5 million contract with reliever Will Smith, who spent this past season with the Rangers.\n\nSmith has won the World Series in each of the last three seasons, but Kansas City's expectations in 2024 don't quite extend to a championship. Instead, the Royals will hope the veteran Smith, who had solid underlying numbers in 2023, can serve as a reliable late-inning arm after both Scott Barlow and Aroldis Chapman were traded before the deadline this past season.\n\nShohei Ohtani agrees to mega contract with Dodgers\n\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 9\n\nSource: Shohei Ohtani, Jeff Passan\n\nTwo-time MVP Shohei Ohtani announced on Instagram that he is signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, spurning the Blue Jays and remaining in the city where he became a sensation with the Angels.\n\nESPN's Jeff Passan reports Ohtani has agreed to a colossal 10-year, $700 million contract shattering the MLB record for both total value and average annual value.\n\nOhtani joins a Dodgers lineup that already features two former MVPs in Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, both of whom were NL MVP finalists in 2023. While he won't pitch again until 2025, Ohtani's power and on-base ability gives Los Angeles the most dangerous trio of hitters in the sport.\n\nMORE: How Dodgers' 2024 payroll looks after handing out monster deal to Shohei Ohtani\n\nRed Sox swing deal for Cardinals' Tyler O'Neill\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nDays after trading Alex Verdugo to the Yankees, the Red Sox have acquired OF Tyler O'Neill from the Cardinals in a deal that sends pitching prospects Nick Robertson and Victor Santos to St. Louis.\n\nO'Neill enjoyed a breakthrough 2021 season with the Cardinals, batting .286 with 34 home runs and a .912 OPS, but he's struggled to recapture that level of production over the last two seasons and is set to be a free agent after 2024."

    "body": "The Los Angeles Angels have gone through a tough year. After a heartbreaking 2023 season, they now have to cope with the impending exit of their star two-way star, Shohei Ohtani. The team is also open to trading their nine-time Silver Slugger hitter Mike Trout, should he request it. In a huge miss, a team that couldn\u2019t do well even with two of the league\u2019s biggest talents on their roster may lose said stars at the same time. Will they choose to stay in LA?\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nThe Halos\u2019 cross-town rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, have been eyeing the dynamic Troutani duo for a long time. However, despite fans\u2019 expectations, the Dodgers\u2019 Ohtani-Trout conquest might not take place\u2014and for good reasons.\n\nDo the Dodgers have the budget to afford Ohtani and Trout on the same roster?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nShohei Ohtani\u2019s next projected contract value is predicted to be around $500\u2013$600 million. If it goes through, he will break Trout\u2019s biggest MLB deal record of 12 years, $426.5 million. Now, we all know that the Dodgers have deep pockets; they have managed to maintain quite a costly lineup this season valued at $283 million. But can they afford two of baseball\u2019s biggest superstars at full value?\n\nNow, with Trout\u2019s $426.5 million tagline, the slugger has an annual salary of about $35.45 million. He still has seven years left on his Angels contract, so get him in blue, the Dodgers will have to pay $248.15 million plus any extension value. Shohei Ohtani\u2019s predicted $535 million for 11 years (according to a Sports Illustrated segment) will bring the Dodgers down to pay him a good $48.63 million annually.\n\nThe Dodgers already have six players whom they have to pay above $10 million a year: Freddie Freeman ($27 million), Mookie Betts ($25 million), Clayton Kershaw ($20 million), Chris Taylor ($15 million), Max Muncy ($13.5 million), and J.D. Martinez ($10 million). Among the top-paid players, Clayton Kershaw is exiting the team this season. That, along with a few other player offloads, will free up enough space in the Dodgers payroll to support two $25 million or three $10 million p/a players on their team. Neither Trout nor Ohtani falls within that price range, so keeping both together at the same time would not be a feasible option for the Dodgers right now.\n\nPitchers or Hitters? Who Will the Dodgers Prioritize This Free Agency?\n\nThe Dodgers have been in dire need of pitchers for a few seasons. Their current highest strikeout rate by a pitcher in a single postseason is 137 SOs by Clayton Kershaw, followed by 119 SOs by Bobby Miller and 117 SOs by Julio Urias. With Shohei Ohtani\u2019s high strikeout rate of 167 this season, he\u2019ll be an invaluable addition to the team. However, there\u2019s a little hiccup that could keep that from happening.\n\nOhtani will not be available to pitch throughout the 2024 season due to an elbow ligament injury he\u2019s currently recovering from. Given the pitcher\u2019s unavoidable absence, it will not be advisable for the Dodgers to hire him until 2025. Yes, Ohtani does have magnificent hitting form as well. However, the team already has hitters like Freeman and Betts, who have scored 211 and 179 hits this regular season, respectively. Speaking of hitters, why will they still want Trout to join the team despite having better-than-average hitters on the team?\n\nWhy will the Dodgers sign an injury-prone Trout?\n\nMike Trout might have been absent for most of the 2023 season, but his career records boast the story of a legendary hitter who has given more than his salt\u2019s worth to his current team. He has bagged 1624 hits and 940 RBIs with an 85.2 WAR and .301 BA across his 12-year-long baseball career. Unfortunately, Trout has become a victim of an injury streak, starting in 2022. He got his hands, left groin, back, and foot injured five times in the entire season; in 2023, he faced two hand injuries in two consecutive months.\n\nDespite his injury-prone history, the more logical option for the Dodgers would be to choose Trout over Ohtani; the team will not be able to afford them both at the same time. Trout comes with a cheaper price tag of $35.45 million compared to Ohtani\u2019s projected $48.63 million. The Dodgers could use his All-Star form in between injuries if he still keeps getting them in 2024. With Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers would be wasting a year letting him play at-bat, with a high chance of getting him further injured and missing more pitching time. Isn\u2019t it better to have a consistently wounded soldier than risk losing an overperforming one in a game of chances?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWhy would Mike Trout switch to another Los Angeles team?\n\nTrout has been pretty persistent about sticking with the Los Angeles Angels from the very start. The team has been transparent about not stopping him should he choose to play for another team, but he does not want to do that. However, it seems that the Angels will have a hard time affording a player like Trout in the foreseeable future, as they have to win a good number of games to stay in the playoffs and keep a steady income of revenue throughout the seasons. Considering their 73-game win record this season, that seems like a pipe dream right now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTrout is 32 years old, which means that he has already hit the MLB average retirement age of 30. He still has a lot left to give to the diamond for approximately 6 more years. If the Dodgers have the chance to draft them, should they go with Ohtani, Trout, both, or neither? Let us know your opinions in the comment box.\n\nWatch This Story: Shohei Ohtani\u2019s Two-Way Dream: Before Injury, He Always Wanted Both!"

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIt was the sequel Newcastle United did not want, the second cruel comeback in as many Champions League games. For some 45 minutes, including half-time, they could savour the sight of a table that showed them in second, permitting them to imagine a date with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the knockout stages. And then, little more than half an hour, they were ejected from Europe altogether.\n\nChristian Pulisic\u2019s equaliser threatened to condemn them to the Europa League. Samuel Chukwueze\u2019s winner instead meant that spot goes to AC Milan. The group of death went down to the dying minutes, but Newcastle have perished. They had savoured a return to Europe but there will be no continental trips for them in the spring of 2024.\n\nAnd, after Kylian Mbappe\u2019s controversial 98th-minute leveller in Paris, they can rue the loss of another lead. Once again, they may feel entitled to believe they should have won, but for different reasons. For much of the night, they were rampant and had Milan reeling. Yet, last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists hung in the game, scored twice and hit the woodwork twice more. For Newcastle, a third consecutive defeat may come with the sense that their injuries came at a cost. Theirs was another colossal effort, a far better performance than at Everton or Tottenham, but while Eddie Howe had the luxury of one attacking substitute \u2013 in Alexander Isak \u2013 three replacements combined for Milan\u2019s decider: first Luka Jovic found Noah Okafor and he picked out Chukwueze, who placed a shot past Martin Dubravka.\n\nIt was a sign of Newcastle\u2019s determination to win, not to settle for the point and the Europa League place, that they were short-staffed at the back because centre-back Fabian Schar had charged into the Milan box in open play. Likewise, in a frantic finale, they almost conceded a third: with Dubravka out of his goal, Theo Hernandez almost scored from the halfway line and Fikayo Tomori hit the post.\n\nAs they wonder what might have been, they can reflect on the turning point of Pulisic\u2019s strike, around the time Warren Zaire-Emery drew Paris Saint-Germain level against Borussia Dortmund. Newcastle failed to clear as the ball ricocheted around their box before Olivier Giroud found Pulisic to poke in a shot. The American had been a target for Newcastle last January; how they must now regret the fact he joined Milan in the summer.\n\nThen, with 11 minutes remaining, Rafael Leao sprinted clear and shot against the post. If this had threatened to be the derby of the depleted, Milan had Leao back for the first time in a month. Newcastle had Callum Wilson able to start, but their goal came from a less regular source, with a thunderbolt from Joelinton.\n\nJoelinton thumped home Newcastle\u2019s goal (Reuters)\n\nOne of the great success stories of Howe\u2019s reign, the misfit forward who was reinvented as a talismanic midfielder gave Newcastle a deserved lead. Joelinton\u2019s rasping, rising shot from the edge of the box flew past Mike Maignan. He had taken Miguel Almiron\u2019s pass and teed himself up. His initial non-celebration may have reflected his own surprise at the unerring accuracy of his strike.\n\nTheirs was the right response to the disappointment in Paris, a stirring effort. At this level, Newcastle do not possess a talent advantage but they can seek to outwork anyone. They rattled Milan by running at them. It took two astonishing interventions to stop them scoring both before and after Joelinton\u2019s strike.\n\nAt 0-0, Fikayo Tomori made a magnificent goal-line tackle to stop Miguel Almiron applying the finishing touch to Joelinton\u2019s low cross. It was a remarkable rescue act but pressure told when the Brazilian struck. Another almost joined him on the scoresheet at 1-1.\n\nNewcastle saw their European dreams slip away (Getty)\n\nMaignan tipped Bruno Guimaraes\u2019 20-yard shot onto the bar. As Nick Pope had denied Milan victory in San Siro with a string of saves, Stefano Pioli\u2019s team could testify to the difference brilliant goalkeeping can make. Now they benefited from it. Newcastle had 17 shots, eight on target, but Maignan was only beaten once. Milan had two shots on target but Dubravka conceded twice.\n\nThe loss of the injured Pope may have proved pivotal. But perhaps seven-time winners, and a side who reached the last four last year, displayed greater knowhow. Maybe they simply had greater strength in depth on a night when Kieran Trippier and Anthony Gordon were taken off because they seemed exhausted.\n\nNewcastle can nevertheless depart the competition with heads held high. One win and five points seem meagre tallies for their contribution to the competition. They have proof it can be unforgiving, reasons to return. Their first Champions League campaign for two decades will surely not be their last for another 20 years. But it is over, and they are left to wonder about what might have been."

    "body": "All eyes since the start of the offseason have been on Shohei Ohtani. And for the most part, there hasn't been much to see.\n\nThe two-way phenom is the most sought-after free agent in MLB history, with his combination of talent and marketability making him a franchise-changing player.\n\nAnd the bidding for Ohtani could be winding down soon. Multiple reports have indicated Ohtani could sign at some point during the winter meetings, which are scheduled to take place from Dec. 3 through Dec. 6.\n\nMany of the top teams are expected to be in the mix for Ohtani. The Dodgers and Cubs are among the top teams expected to be aiming to sign the two-time AL MVP, and plenty of others should continue to compete through the end to land him.\n\nHere's the latest on Ohtani's free agency pursuits.\n\nMORE: Projecting Shohei Ohtani's contract in free agency\n\nShohei Ohtani news: Latest updates, rumors for MLB free agency\n\nOhtani agrees to 10-year, $700 million deal with Dodgers\n\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 9\n\nShohei Ohtani announced Saturday that he has agreed to a contract with the Dodgers. It's a colossal 10-year, $700 million deal with \"significant deferrals,\" so while Los Angeles won't pay him $70 million per year, the franchise will be paying him beyond those 10 seasons.\n\nWhile rumors connected Ohtani to the Blue Jays on Friday, it's the Dodgers who hand him a record-shattering contract and pair the two-time MVP with two former MVPs in Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman.\n\nOhtani not headed to Toronto, at his home in Southern California\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\n\nSource: Bob Nightengale, USA Today; Ben Nicholson-Smith, Sportsnet\n\nOhtani had a change of plans, apparently. Hours after MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported that the two-way star was headed to Toronto for a meeting on Friday, USA Today's Nightengale and Sportsnet's Nicholson-Smith reported that Ohtani is at his home in Southern California.\n\nThe Blue Jays are still finalists to land Ohtani but his landing spot is not official yet.\n\nOhtani headed to Toronto on Friday\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nOhtani might not have officially picked a team, but he is headed to Toronto, per MLB Network's Jon Morosi. It had been previously reported he had picked the Blue Jays, though several reports have since denied that he has made a decision.\n\nReport: Ohtani picks Blue Jays over Dodgers\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\n\nSource: J.P. Hoornstra, Dodgers Nation\n\nThe Blue Jays have reportedly won the sweepstakes for Ohtani. According to Dodgers Nation's J.P. Hoornstra, Ohtani has selected the Blue Jays. The official details have not been reported, though the report indicated it will shatter Mike Trout's record 12-year, $426.5 million deal.\n\nHowever, Sportsnet's Ben Nicholson-Smith reported Ohtani has not yet made his decision, and there is not a timeline, though he noted Toronto is a finalist.\n\nDecision from Ohtani 'imminent'\n\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nThe wait could soon be over. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported Ohtani is expected to make his decision soon, reporting it could come as early as Friday. Coincidentally, Ohtani made his original decision to sign with the Angels on Dec. 8, 2017, six years to the day.\n\nDave Roberts says Dodgers met with Ohtani\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Alden Gonzalez, ESPN\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Tuesday that the team met with Ohtani for 2-3 hours over the weekend. Roberts said Ohtani is \"clearly\" the Dodgers' top priority, adding that the team is confident the two-time MVP will pitch again. Roberts wasn't able to offer a timeline for Ohtani's decision.\n\nCubs losing optimism in signing Ohtani\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Bob Nightengale, USA Today\n\nThe Cubs have been viewed as one of Ohtani's likeliest destinations for a while. It appears that might no longer be the case. USA Today's Bob Nightengale reported one high-ranking executive believes the Cubs' optimism of signing Ohtani \"has now significantly wanted.\" The report stated that leaves the Dodgers, Blue Jays, Angels and Giants as the remaining finalists.\n\nOhtani has 'positive feeling' about Blue Jays\n\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, The New York Post\n\nThe Blue Jays reported met with Ohtani on Monday, but even before he went to talk with the team, Ohtani reportedly had a \"positive feeling about Toronto,\" along with other cities and teams, including the Dodgers. He has been linked to Toronto and Los Angeles throughout the process.\n\nBlue Jays 'believed' to have met with Shohei Ohtani\n\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\n\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\n\nWhile one report earlier Monday indicated Ohtani isn't expected to sign before the end of the Winter Meetings, the process seems to be moving along.\n\nThe Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports Ohtani is \"believed\" to have met with the Blue Jays at the team's complex in Florida on Monday, far away from the meetings in Nashville. The Blue Jays have been pursuing Ohtani and Juan Soto in hopes of striking a deal for one of the two stars.\n\nBraves are reportedly 'engaged' with Ohtani's camp\n\nDate: Dec. 4\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nIt's not surprising that any and all teams should be interested in Ohtani's services, but imagine the Braves landing the superstar? According to MLB Network's Jon Morosi, the Braves are \"engaged\" in talks with Ohtani's camp. Imagine a lineup consisting of Ohtani, Ronald Acuna Jr., Ozzie Albies, Austin Riley and Matt Olson?\n\nSources: Braves are among the teams still engaged with Shohei Ohtani\u2019s camp, as I reported in this @MLBNetwork segment. @MLB pic.twitter.com/lP4lISzttN \u2014 Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) December 4, 2023\n\nOhtani has already received several $500+ million offers\n\nDate: Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, NY Post\n\nIt's no surprise the bidding for Ohtani is heating up, with the star expected to sign soon. And New York Post's Jon Heyman reported Ohtani has already received several deals that have topped $500 million, which could mean he winds up being the first $600 million player in MLB history. He added there are believed to be five teams in the running for Ohtani.\n\nOhtani decision coming this week\n\nDate: Dec. 3\n\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\n\nWith the winter meetings set to begin in Nashville, it seems a resolution is near for Ohtani. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reports the superstar is \"likely to decide on a team within the next week,\" according to a source.\n\nOhtani race starting to clear up\n\nDate: Dec. 1\n\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\n\nTwo days before the start of the winter meetings, the picture on Ohtani is beginning to clear a bit more. ESPN's Jeff Passan reported the Rangers, Red Sox and Mets appear to be out of the running for Ohtani, while the Dodgers, Cubs, Blue Jays and Angels remain in the mix. The Giants are considered to be an unknown.\n\nIn addition to the teams, Passan also reported Ohtani is expecting a contract somewhere between $550 and $600 million, which would be the largest guaranteed contract in North American sports.\n\nBlue Jays could alter roster with Ohtani signing\n\nDate: Nov. 30\n\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\n\nThe Blue Jays are one of the teams believed to still be among the strongest in the mix for Ohtani. The New York Post's Jon Heyman reported there could be some changes if Ohtani signs with the Blue Jays, however, reporting that some rivals believe Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. could hit the trade block if Toronto lands the star.\n\nTrading the two infielders might seem counterproductive to signing Ohtani in the first place. Those two would be the biggest supporting bats in the lineup around Ohtani. However, both are free agents after the 2025 season, and given the added payroll of signing Ohtani, it's possible Toronto would view keeping the other two phenoms as too pricey."

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/17/new-alzheimers-drugs-bring-hope-of-slowing-disease-for-uk-patients",
    "body": "People in Britain could benefit from a key medical breakthrough next year. They may be given access to the first drugs ever developed to slow the impact of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe first of these medicines \u2013 lecanemab \u2013 was recently approved in the US and Japan, where treatments using it have already been launched. A second drug, donanemab, is expected to follow soon, and next year it is anticipated that the UK medical authorities will consider both of them for approval in Britain.\n\nThe prospect has raised hopes that, after years of effort, scientists may be closing in on ways to directly tackle the UK\u2019s dementia crisis. About a million people are living with the condition in this country, and this is expected to rise to about 1.7 million by 2040 \u2013 with potentially grim consequences. Last year dementia took the lives of 66,000 people in England and Wales, and it is now the leading cause of death in Britain, with Alzheimer\u2019s accounting for two-thirds of cases.\n\nUntil now doctors have only been able to prescribe medicines that help patients manage their symptoms, so the arrival of the first drugs that treat the actual cause of the condition has been welcomed \u2013 although experts have warned that their use should be treated with some caution.\n\nAfter decades of research, these are the first drugs to improve patients\u2019 lives directly. If nothing else, they suggest we\u2019re on the right road to tackling Alzheimer\u2019s\n\n\u201cThe new drugs slow down the development of Alzheimer\u2019s by six months to a year and are useful only for those in the early stages of the condition, so they are certainly not miracle medicines,\u201d said David Thomas, head of policy at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK.\n\n\u201cHowever, after decades of research, they are the first to improve patients\u2019 lives directly, and that is a justifiable cause for excitement. If nothing else, they suggest we are probably on the right road to tackling Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThis point was backed by neurologist Cath Mummery, of the Dementia Research Centre at University College London. \u201cIt has been a very long, hard road, but finally we have something positive to look at. That is very welcome.\u201d\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is triggered by the buildup of a protein called amyloid in the brain, although symptoms may not appear for decades after this accretion has started. Scientists have tried for more than 20 years to find ways to stop amyloid from forming these plaques, in the hope this would stop the progression of the disease.\n\nLecanemab, which is produced by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai, and donanemab, produced by Eli Lilly of the US, are the first medicines to achieve this aim \u2013 though they only slow but do not ultimately halt the disease\u2019s progression.\n\nGraeme Armstrong with wife Trina, who has a rare form of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nBoth drugs are to be considered for approval in the UK next year. The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will first decide if they are safe and effective, then the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) will rule on whether they offer value for money.\n\nBoth medicines are expensive \u2013 lecanemab costs about $25,000 (\u00a319,700) a year \u2013 and are given by regular intravenous infusions. \u201cThat is a challenge from a health-service point of view, because you need to find the space and time to put someone in an infusion suite to treat them,\u201d added Thomas.\n\nHowever, the main problem facing doctors is the difficulty involved in pinpointing dementia not just in its early stages but even in its later phases. Most cases are first presented to GPs, who will then refer patients to memory clinics for a dementia test. However there are long waiting times \u2013 up to two years on average \u2013 for appointments at these centres.\n\nIn addition, diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia is usually based on pen-and-paper tests, followed by lumbar punctures and brain scans before a final diagnosis.\n\nAbout 65% of cases are confirmed this way. The remaining third of dementia cases are never diagnosed. Yet patients can only expect to receive treatments \u2013 including the new drugs \u2013 if their condition is identified.\n\nEleanor Mackenzie-Smith\u2019s father, Mike, has young-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. His first symptoms were spotted 17 years ago, when Eleanor was 11. \u201cHowever, it took over 10 years from the start of his symptoms and four separate tests between 2009 and 2017 to get my dad\u2019s final diagnosis, when he was 65. It was distressing not knowing what was happening. Too many families, like mine, have had to watch as dementia takes hold of our loved ones while we are left without a diagnosis and the support and access to treatments.\u201d\n\nIt took 10 years for Mike Mackenzie-Smith to get a diagnosis of young-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAnother grim illustration of the problem facing patients is provided by Graeme Armstrong. His wife, Trina, began having trouble recognising faces and reading telephone numbers in 2006 and was told, after a CT scan three years later, that she had probably had a stroke \u2013 although her symptoms did not suggest such a diagnosis. It took another three years before she was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy, a rare variant of Alzheimer\u2019s disease that affects the way the brain interprets information from the eyes.\n\n\u201cHad we had an accurate diagnosis four years earlier, Trina could have been placed on the correct medication, which may have been more effective and helped her day to day,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nOne solution sought by doctors involves the creation of blood tests which could pinpoint the disease quickly and effectively. \u201cThese are under research, but we are several years away from having them in widespread use,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cMeanwhile, we have got to get the NHS to a state where it is much more focused and better organised in getting better and earlier dementia diagnoses. That will be crucial in our battle against the condition.\u201d\n\nMummery agreed: \u201cBy the time you have dementia, you will have had Alzheimer\u2019s disease developing in your brain for at least 20 years. Dementia is the latest stage; we need to pick up signals much earlier. So we need to be thinking about how to diagnose people at the very earliest stages of disease, when they may only have very, very subtle symptoms.\n\nWe are now exploring ways of helping drugs get into the brain much more efficiently, and that could have a major impact Cath Mummery\n\n\u201cOur current service isn\u2019t good for doing that, and we need to develop brain health clinics where we can pinpoint the disease much earlier, then help to build resilience against dementia in a patient when it is only in a very early stage.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, scientists also point to a number of recent developments which have raised hopes that it may be possible to tackle dementia more directly and effectively. One major challenge they have faced is the problem of getting drugs to pass through the blood-brain barrier, which controls the movement of ions and molecules from our bodies to our brains. That makes it difficult to get drugs into the central nervous system to tackle problems such as amyloid plaques.\n\n\u201cHowever, researchers are developing active transport methods for getting drugs across the blood-brain barrier,\u201d said Mummery. \u201cFor example, we are now exploring ways of helping drugs get into the brain much more efficiently, and that could have a major impact.\u201d\n\nSuch developments will take years to realise, scientists caution, and a great deal needs to be done in the short term to deal with dementia.\n\n\u201cIt is clear we have taken a step in the right direction but there is much more to do before we can have successfully dealt with these processes that are happening to our brains,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cIt is a challenge, and a very important one.\u201d"

We\u2019ve collected some of our favorite titles that allow for good old-fashioned local play.\n\nIt\u2019s also my preferred play style, as the last few years have given me more excuses to stay in and try new games. Local multiplayer makes ass-kicking games much more approachable, thanks to friends respawning my character. I also love building something together in real time, like a farm in Stardew Valley, or causing communal chaos like with Untitled Goose Game\u2019s treacherous honking. Sure, couch co-op can also mean getting revived just to get ragdolled across spikes in Spelunky 2. But it sure beats dying alone.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for more platform-agnostic couch co-op recommendations, here are our favorite local multiplayer games, games to play with a Valentine\u2019s Day beau, and a Dear Polygon column about couch co-op. Our last update added Escape Academy.\n\nFor two players\n\nThis modern-classic farming sim game takes its cues from the Harvest Moon series, and running a farm with your friends only adds to the fun. You can work together to plant and harvest crops or spend your days doing different activities, like fishing or mining. Local co-op is available for two players \u2014 just don\u2019t forget to build an extra cabin on your farm. (Up to four can play with online multiplayer.)\n\nThis Switch remaster includes both Portal and Portal 2, seminal games well worth the revisit. You\u2019ll explore and solve puzzles by using a portal gun; experimenting within the game\u2019s physics is even more fun with a friend in tow. (Plus, when playing local co-op, the number of portals that can be placed is doubled.)\n\nCongrats, you are the new CEO of a large corporation, and your wisdom is required to help employees stay on task. Good Job! has a lot in common with Untitled Goose Game. In this isometric game, you\u2019ll be given a list of tasks \u2014 like bringing a projector into the conference room. But no one said you couldn\u2019t do it by launching it like a projectile through the window.\n\nThis Wii U game\u2019s Switch port is full of charm. Play together in local co-op as Captain Toad and Toadette, and explore and solve your way through a series of bite-size puzzles. Each self-contained course has little nooks and crannies to pop in and out of, and Koopas to navigate around.\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely morning in the village and you are a horrible goose! Cause mayhem and honk to your heart\u2019s content in this charming game. With local co-op you and one friend can each be horrible geese, using teamwork to terrorize the townspeople. Honk honk HONK!!\n\nIn this melancholy game, you play as Stella the ferrymaster, who guides spirits into the afterlife. Meet wonderful characters and help them find closure. Spiritfarer combines exploration on the seas with management sim elements, as you build housing, kitchens, and more, and learn to farm, cook, and craft. Player two is Stella\u2019s cat Daffodil, who can do most management sim tasks \u2014 she just can\u2019t talk to characters, and thus, can\u2019t trigger quests.\n\nScrew playing as the plumber in the red hat \u2014 it\u2019s time to be his taller counterpart. In Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, you can play local co-op with player two as Gooigi (a spooky goo Luigi) after finishing the intro walkthrough and getting E. Gadd\u2019s briefcase. Platform your way through the haunted hotel to save your friends Mario, Peach, and numerous Toads.\n\nThis modern-day, punishingly difficult platformer has the beautiful look of vintage animation. The art direction and soundtrack are wholly unique, making the game a joyride from start to finish, despite the challenge. Mugman, Cuphead\u2019s sibling, can join on a local co-op journey.\n\nPlay as a Yarny (a living ball of yarn that looks like a small sprite) and solve puzzles with a friend by using your spare yarn to pull, yank, and swing. It requires quite a bit of teamwork. Where other local co-op games might allow players to wander and do their own thing, this game is all about solving puzzles using each other\u2019s momentum.\n\nKirby games tend to be perfectly chill and incredibly adorable, and this one is no exception. In Forgotten Land you and another player run, float, and fight through 3D levels. In addition to Kirby\u2019s classic inhale powers, Forgotten Land also gifted us \u201cmouthful mode,\u201d which lets Kirby stretch like a glove over enormous objects like cars and huge lightbulbs. (By the way, Kirby Star Allies is also fun with local co-op.)\n\nPlay as characters named \u201cNobody\u201d as you work together to attempt to cure the world of a poisonous blight, and figure out why you have no memory of your past life. But there\u2019s another twist: Instead of a classic perk tree, your characters will unlock various forms \u2014 like a turtle, ghost, knight, or ninja \u2014 each with its own set of moves. What\u2019s more, the forms can synergize with one another, making for some incredibly absurd skill combos.\n\nCat Quest 2\n\nThis criminally underrated action game puts you in the shoes of a cat fighting their way through the pun-filled land of Felingard. And player two gets to be a dog! Playing is a simple grind in this approachable and silly RPG. Fight your way through dungeons, meet necromancer cats, and try on lots of outfits.\n\nPlay as an automaton that needs a gem substance to survive, and fight against the clock to keep your friends from becoming \u201cunsighted\u201d and turning into shells of their former selves. This Metroidvania has an incredible map with three interwoven floors of levels, and tons of Zelda-like puzzles. A couch co-op buddy makes these challenges much more surmountable.\n\nThis pixel art Metroidvania has the feel of a great NES game, with its retro aesthetic and excellent platforming and battling. The definitive edition (which includes the original Shovel of Hope campaign), available on Nintendo Switch, supports local co-op for two players.\n\nThe Lego games are always a great laugh, and they have reliable couch co-op modes (see also: Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2). They\u2019re accessible, family-friendly, and give a silly spin to some of the most recognizable films of our time. The Skywalker Saga is no different, with Lego versions of a whopping nine movies from the behemoth franchise and 200-plus minifigs to unlock.\n\nA silly collaboration between Nintendo and Ubisoft became one of the sleeper hits of its release year. This squad tactics game pairs Mario and friends with their own doppelganger Rabbids against a veritable sea of evil Rabbids. While local co-op is limited to five specific challenges \u2014 so we wouldn\u2019t recommend buying it specifically for co-op play alone \u2014 these levels are especially fun. Working together changes the tactical dynamics.\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is the perfect combination of dungeon crawler and rhythm game \u2014 with some sweet tunes, to enliven the whole experience. But dancing through the game\u2019s levels is even more fun with a friend, even if having someone else there doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easier. You both still have to stay on beat!\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted an escape room experience but in a video game, Escape Academy absolutely scratches that itch. Up to two couch co-op players can go to this school for puzzle enthusiasts. Players find solutions and crack codes to avoid legitimately perilous fates \u2014 like a tower flooding with water as you climb. Hints (and red herrings) are everywhere. Are you smart enough to escape each room?\n\nFor two or more players\n\nSuper Mario Bros. has always been one of Nintendo\u2019s most beloved franchises, and Wonder is another banger. Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings together so many delightful ideas: platforming shenanigans, silly power-ups, and lots of map secrets. The best part? Four people can play local multiplayer, picking from so many classic characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toad, Toadette, and more.\n\nI\u2019ve donated hours and hours of my life to this deceptively simple roguelike bullet-hell \u2014 min-maxing various buffs in order to avoid waves of mob attacks. But multiplayer changes everything. Having more reinforcements to fight waves of attacks means each player can try out unique combinations of weapons and buffs. Just make sure you and your teammates stay in the same screen; there isn\u2019t split screen.\n\nThough packing up and moving is a pain in the neck in real life, Moving Out 2 turns the experience into a goofy, whimsical group experience. Play as a member of the F.A.R.T. moving crew (yes, you read that correctly) attempting to move furniture, and other items, around some highly inconvenient spaces.\n\nNow more than a decade old, Diablo 3 is still a great local multiplayer choice, especially on the Switch. The action RPG, which felt bombastic when it first came out, has become a very comforting grind game that I get to share with friends. (Especially as Diablo 4 hasn\u2019t made its way to Nintendo Switch.)\n\nThis one is not for the faint of heart. Work with a friend to excavate cave levels, avoid the dangers within, and ration supplies. In local co-op, if one of you dies, you can bring them back to life by finding a coffin. Ragdoll physics \u2014 not to mention turkey riding \u2014 add challenge and humor to one of the best platformer roguelikes.\n\nThis edition of Rayman Legends has all of the platforming and hijinks that the series is known for. Play through delightful levels and time trials, and collect to your heart\u2019s content. Having multiple players is particularly helpful for respawning, as the game ramps up in difficulty in its later levels.\n\nSure, racing games and soccer games are fun on their own \u2014 but mashing the two together results in something bizarre and unforgettable. Rocket League asks what other games don\u2019t dare to: What if you played soccer? And what if you did that with rocket-powered vehicles?\n\nTowerfall Ascension is the gold standard for 2D arena games. Players are archers and must fight each other with well-placed arrows, or by stomping from above. Movement is a dream with dodging and dashing in the air, lending each character a spry and agile feel. Different multiplayer variants, like starting with just one arrow and having to scavenge for others, keep rounds feeling fresh.\n\nThis bestseller is a no-brainer for anyone looking to spend time with friends in a sandbox world. Mine, build, dig, fish, plant crops, and protect yourself from the monsters that come out at night \u2014 and most of all, survive.\n\nThis definitive remaster bundles Overcooked and Overcooked 2 (both excellent games) into one delicious package. Prepare orders for hungry customers while facing ridiculous odds \u2014 like cooking in a hot air balloon with cooktops that sometimes catch on fire, or while crossing a busy street.\n\nIf you\u2019re searching for that classic Super Mario feeling in a modern 3D world, look no further. (Or if you\u2019ve always wanted to play as Mario in a cat suit.) Play as Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Toad \u2014 each of them has a slightly different perk. Luigi can get a bit more air in his jump, while Toad is a bit faster.\n\nThe Mario Party series reigns supreme as a family-friendly, chill party time. In this board game-style title, players pick their favorite Nintendo character and then roll the dice to land on a spot on the board. Players compete in minigames, including a baseball-bat-swinging rhythm game, rowboat race, snow catching, and so many more.\n\nWii Sports\u2019 legacy will never be forgotten (nor will its banging soundtrack). Nintendo Switch Sports gracefully takes up the mantle of its predecessor, along with many of the same classic sports, like bowling, golf, and tennis. It also adds some new ones to the mix, like volleyball and chambara (a great complement to Wii Sports\u2019 boxing). Just make sure you have enough space around you so you don\u2019t accidentally hit your television.\n\nNo multiplayer Nintendo Switch list would be complete without mentioning the most recent edition of 20-year series Mario Kart. Though the game came out in 2017, it still reigns supreme, as far as kart racing goes \u2014 and it still gets new courses, like the recent addition of Mario Kart 7\u2019s Rainbow Road.\n\nScramble with your friends to operate a spaceship hurtling through outer space. Each of you can only pilot one of the ship\u2019s eight total control panels at any given time. We hope you like your partners, because you\u2019ll be shouting directions and trying not to lose it as you work together.\n\nThe premise is simple: Each of you is a piece of paper, and you can cut shapes out of one another in order to accomplish tasks. Some of these challenges involve working together to create a specific shape. Others require teamwork to shoot a ball into a hoop or fill up a basin with water. Bring your most levelheaded (or, alternatively, chaotic) friends.\n\nAnother Switch take on a stone-cold classic, Nintendo\u2019s fight-to-the-death brawler is stocked with all of your favorite characters. Play with up to seven other people and survive to be the last one standing.\n\nTMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge is a return to the halcyon days for any TMNT fan, and a truly excellent beat-\u2019em-up brawler. Players can choose between the four Turtles \u2014 Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael \u2014 along with April O\u2019Neil, Master Splinter, or Casey Jones."

    "body": "The baseball season for the New York teams didn\u2019t turn out to be their most successful one. Both the New York Mets and the New York Yankees failed to make it to the playoffs and came under scrutiny as the highest spenders in the league. But the level of accounting has come higher for the 27-time winners because of the highest expectations. The management has comprehended the situation and is actively seeking to make changes for the 2024 season. Be it trimming the squad and releasing a few players, including superstar Gleyber Torres, they look to bring about changes. But given that they are already short on options, it brings up the question: Is the move justified?\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nAlthough it was a decent season for the second baseman, the lack of consistency brought Torres under scrutiny for changes for the upcoming season. Also, given he is currently in arbitration with the Yankees, it adds to his trade chances. The reason is that the team won\u2019t want to lose the opportunity to cash in some money from his trade. The decision appears promising as the team seeks a shift, but the data tells a different story. Gleyber Torres\u2019s Exit Becomes the Talk of the Town as the Yankees Look for a Rebuild The New York Yankees have been in the news since the league stage ended. First, because of the possibility of a third-party audit, which was later shunted out. Later, the comments from Aaron Judge brought a lot of attention to the workings of the team, conflicts, and divisions between the core four. Now it\u2019s the assumptions of changes with the idea of cutting down the $300 million budget for the next season. One name that is making the rounds for an exit is Gleyber Torres. Notably, the 26-year-old avoided arbitration ahead of the 2023 season and signed a $9.95 million contract. It was a brilliant move, given the requirements of the Bronx Bombers. Torres fulfilled it for most of the season to finish it on a high, scoring 90 runs, 25 home runs, and 68 RBIs at an average of 0.273 and an OPS of 0.800. Torres also finished at the top of the batting charts for the team, alongside captain Aaron Judge, clinching the most hits and recording an OBP of 0.347. The infielder also finished second in the fielding department behind the team\u2019s Gold Glove prospect, Anthony Volpe. The seasoned player made 80 double plays, with 563 chances created at a fielding percentage of 0.975. The performance from Gleyber has been crucial in a season filled with injuries on both fronts. But the Yankees are not favoring his services for the upcoming season. There are two reasons behind the interest of the Miami Marlins and the push for lower spending. As mlbtraderumors.com suggests, Torres is expected to earn $15.3 million next year; his trade could save the Yankees some money. The Marlins have been interested in him for a long time, and the Pinstripes can have a good deal for the outfielder. Considering the advantages, this appears promising. However, is it a worthwhile endeavor? Should the New York Yankees Trade Gleyber Torres Ahead of the New Season? Nothing has worked well for the New York Yankees this season. They had their worst finish in seven years, even after having all the resources. The Yankees are seeking a shift in their strategy, which has exceeded their initial expectations. This shift encompasses alterations in both offensive and defensive personnel, and surprisingly, it involves Gleyber Torres. Although it is a reboot button from Brian Cashman for a better 2024, should the Yankees refraining from including Torres? The answer is simple: they should indeed because of his worth as a player. It may sound huge as they expect Torres to earn $15 million, but it is not a big ask for the multibillion-dollar Yankees. The 2009 champions can easily fulfill this request without constraining their spending.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nPlus, Torres is the sole option for the Yankees at second base. With limited options available in the market, the team is in the circumstances to spend more. And if the Yankees are for other infielders, they may have to reshuffle to make their place in the squad. It will include the shift of Oswaldo Peraza from third baseman to second. However, Peraza could not do well this season, even after all the positives. His involvement in unique positions could be a risk for the team.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nMoreover, free agents Whit Merrifield and Adam Frazier have not done well. Given that the Yankees finished second last in total hits and had over 1400 strikeouts, losing a player with the best record in both parameters will not be ideal. Notably, Torres has a 14.6% strikeout rate, with only a handful of players recording a lower rate. He also covered a lot of bases this season to finish second to Judge. All these factors make him a player that the Yankees should keep as they look for a change in 2024.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nnot in the best shape, losing Torres could haunt the Yankees further. It will be interesting to see how the most successful team approaches this. Will they be able to find genuine replacements on the market? Only time will tell. His trading is not worth it for the Yankees, which will further reduce the options in the outfield. With rookies and the farm not compensating for the demand, it would be a big ask for them to fulfill.

    "body": "The United States has long had an affordable housing crisis, but it\u2019s been exacerbated as of late by a surge in mortgage interest rates and low inventory.\n\nThe problem is especially acute for lower-income families.\n\nOne Portland, Maine-based startup is out to help address the problem by buying single-family homes in blighted neighborhoods, renovating them and then renting them out to very low-income families, the elderly and the disabled (or Section-8 voucher holders). That startup, Simply Homes, has recently secured $22 million in funding to further its efforts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping to solve the affordability crisis for people who struggle with housing stability the most,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Brian Bagdasarian. \u201cWhile there are groups that have attempted to tackle programmatic buying of homes in the past \u2014 to varying degrees of success \u2014 the reality is no one is operating in our market, providing well-maintained affordable homes to the people most in need.\u201d\n\nIndeed, most iBuyers are focused on buying, renovating and either selling or renting homes in middle to upper class neighborhoods. And most home builders are \u201cout of touch and building homes that no one who needs affordable housing could ever afford,\u201d Bagdasarian told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nThe opportunity to help people overcome poverty and improve their chances for social and economic mobility was what attracted Bagdasarian and co-founder and CFO Robert Kavanagh to build Simply Homes\u2019 model.\n\n\u201cChildren that are able to move into lower-poverty neighborhoods can see a 31% increase in lifetime earnings,\u201d Bagdasarian said.\n\nAnd the pair are firm believers that you can still make money and do good at the same time.\n\nFounded in 2020, Simply Homes spent its first couple of years developing its platform and associated models before buying its first home in January of this year. By the end of this month, the startup is expected to have 108 units, or homes, in its portfolio. Since its first-quarter launch, it\u2019s seen its revenue grow by more than 50% quarter over quarter.\n\nOver 80% of Simply Homes\u2019 tenant base are single parents who would need to work an estimated 150 hours a week to afford market-rate rent on a home, notes Bagdasarian. Utilizing HUD\u2019s HCV program through Simply Homes, these families are paying no more than 30% of their income for rent, claims Bagdasarian.\n\nCurrently, Simply Homes operates in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cleveland, Ohio. Its goal is to expand into Baltimore, Maryland and parts of the Midwest, including additional markets throughout Ohio and in St. Louis, Missouri, among other cities. The company looks for stable markets that aren\u2019t susceptible to wild fluctuations in the housing industry.\n\nSimply Homes operates in an operating company/property company structure, with the operational company using its technology platform and operational teams to source, acquire, renovate and manage the properties. The property management company holds them long term.\n\nMany proptech companies have struggled, or outright shut down, this year, in large part due to the sky-high interest rates. But Simply Homes, according to Bagdasarian, factored in the possibility of high interest rates very early on in its model so it has been less affected by the macro environment.\n\n\u201cEverything is underwritten to a worst-case scenario. A lot of first generation ibuyers never underwrote interest rate risk. But we started with that,\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cWe made sure our large return rates were inclusive of high interest rates that still allowed us to operate profitably. The other piece of that is we have highly stable income \u2014 because the way that Housing Choice Voucher works is that the tenant pays 30% of their adjusted monthly income. The voucher covers the balance. So it\u2019s highly predictable income.\u201d\n\nInitially, the company set out to solve the automated underwriting part of the process for third parties, and then for itself by leveraging Bagdasarian\u2019s AI background and Kavanagh\u2019s real estate experience. Bagdasarian has two decades of experience in human process automation and machine learning, and previously was with HubSpot, having joined as part of the founding team of Motion. Kavanagh previously led the acquisition of Ireland\u2019s largest social housing portfolio, and spent 10 years as an investment banker at Jefferies and Cantor Fitzgerald in New York and London, specializing in infrastructure and ESG assets.\n\n\u201cWe know what we can rent the homes for because the housing authority (or HUD) gives us that information. This means we can underwrite \u2014 using that data and machine learning \u2014 very accurately, very effectively and very rapidly,\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cThis eliminates a lot of the friction that has kept other institutions out of the space and gives us this sort of first-mover advantage.\u201d\n\nSimply Homes collects the rent on its properties, which helps cover the cost of managing the properties. It takes a transaction fee, and a 3% fee on an ongoing basis to manage the portfolio.\n\nBesides expanding into new markets, the company plans to use its new capital in part toward developing a series of AI-powered virtual analysts that \u201crapidly\u201d interpret massive amounts of data that Simply Homes aggregates and leverages to make its acquisitions.\n\nGutter Capital and Watchung Capital co-led the company\u2019s recent $22 million funding round, which included participation from Village Global, Ambush Capital, RavenOne Ventures, Neil Parikh, Gabe Flateman, Luke Sherwin and others.\n\nJames Gettinger, managing partner at Gutter Capital, told TechCrunch that he believes Simply Homes is doing something \u201cthat very sorely needs to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy rejuvenating the aging housing stock, they\u2019re able to make homes available to people who are affected by the affordability crisis the most,\u201d he said. \u201cOne facet of the housing shortage that I think doesn\u2019t get enough attention, frankly, is the fact that starter homes are no longer built. The average size of new construction homes has gone from something like 1,400 square feet 50 years ago to 2,200 square feet today. The downstream consequence of that is\u2026basically, none of the new homes that are coming on market are affordable to the majority of Americans..\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone who\u2019s addressing affordability for the bottom end of the market like this,\u201d he added."

    "body": "The purpose of the Amazon Echo Frames is obvious: to provide quick access to Alexa no matter where you are because it\u2019s on your face. But generally speaking, that\u2019s not why anyone wants smart glasses, let alone a pair that costs $389.99 like the Carrera Cruiser model I\u2019ve been wearing for the past week.\n\nFor better or worse, most people\u2019s vision of smart glasses is informed by Tony Stark, James Bond, and other iconic sci-fi and spy movie characters: sleek, discreet devices that have some sort of hidden mixed reality display or the ability to capture the world around you. The original Google Glass cemented that image, while successors like the Snap Spectacles and the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have leaned heavily into content creation. But the Echo Frames hasn\u2019t really ever been quite that ambitious. Like the Bose Frames, Amazon\u2019s approach to smart glasses has primarily been as a pair of open-ear headphones that you can take calls on, listen to music with, and ask the occasional Alexa query. There\u2019s no camera, no screen, and nothing to clue anyone in that you\u2019re not just wearing ordinary glasses.\n\n6 Verge Score Amazon Echo Frames Carrera Cruiser $ 314.99 The Good More stylish and more options\n\nImproved battery life and audio\n\nCan use with multiple devices The Bad Bass still isn\u2019t great and audio leaks\n\nDoes less or sounds not as good as others in this category\n\nAlexa still isn\u2019t the best assistant when you\u2019re on the go\n\nPricey for the category $315 at Amazon How we rate and review products\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t straying too far from that formula with these third-gen Echo Frames. The big thing now is that they\u2019re lighter, the battery lasts longer, the bass is more bassy, and they look a lot more stylish than previous iterations. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to turn the Echo Frames into a must-have gadget \u2014 but it\u2019s a half-step in the right direction.\n\nStrike a pose\n\nIt\u2019s a big deal that Amazon\u2019s latest Echo Frames look nicer than before. Style is one of the most underrated criteria for smart glasses, and put simply, you\u2019re just not going to wear something that makes you look like a dweeb. Everyone\u2019s face and vision is different, and a successful pair of smart glasses is going to account for that by offering a wide range of styles, colors, and fits.\n\nIt\u2019s a vibe.\n\nWith the third-gen Echo Frames, you can choose between clear, prescription, blue light filtering, and sunglass lenses. They also come in multiple shapes, including round, cat eye, square, rectangle, and \u201cmodern\u201d rectangle. These start at $269.99 for the most basic clear lenses, $299.99 for blue light filtering lenses, and $329.99 for sunglasses.\n\nThese are all subtler options, but if you like a flashier style, Amazon is also continuing its partnership with Carrera. That extra pizzazz comes with a heftier price tag. The Cruiser (the one I have) and Sprinter model will both set you back $389.99. The latter is more of a boxy, Wayfarer-esque frame and gives you the option of sunglass or blue light filtering lenses.\n\nI have a low nose bridge, so I had to keep pushing these up after a few seconds.\n\nBecause the Cruiser only comes with sunglass lenses, I wore these during my commute and on outdoor walks. They are a vibe. I\u2019ve been described as channeling Yeezy, a Kardashian reject, a card-carrying member of the Jersey Shore mafia, and a time traveler from the \u201980s. I most definitely have turned heads while on the street. I had fun wearing these, and most folks could pull this off so long as they put a little swagger in their step \u2014 but personally, this isn\u2019t the style I\u2019d pick for my day-to-day sunnies, mostly because they didn\u2019t fit my face well. While these are made of a lightweight acetate weighing 46.3g, I have a low nose bridge, and these were slipping down my face every five seconds. The other thing I didn\u2019t love about the Cruiser glasses was the build quality. While they look high fashion, they feel plasticky in my hands and not befitting of their nearly $400 price tag.\n\nForget the bass\n\nAs I said, these are less smart glasses than they are a pair of open-ear headphones. On that front, the Echo Frames are alright for the category but are nothing mind-blowing.\n\nBass is purportedly three times better on the new Echo Frames, but they\u2019re still not going to bring the thump of even standard AirPods. I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of Stray Kids lately, and Felix\u2019s TikTok-breaking rumbly baritone is absolutely lost on these. In God\u2019s Menu, the song\u2019s famous \u201ccookin\u2019 like a chef I\u2019m a 5-star Michelin\u201d line is reduced to zero-star Michelin. On a loud train, I couldn\u2019t even hear it despite turning the volume up to the max.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem limited to the Echo Frames \u2014 it\u2019s a common problem with any open-ear audio headphones. That said, the same song on the Meta smart glasses sounded a bit richer. These were a lot better for podcasts or less bass-heavy songs, but you still can\u2019t get away from the feeling like you\u2019re listening to something from a few feet away instead of right next to your ear.\n\nI don\u2019t love the charging stand, but battery life has been improved.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a fair amount of audio leakage. No one asked me to turn things down while I was commuting. Trains and city noises are loud. But at the same volume in the office, all of my co-workers could hear that I was listening to something. They might not have been able to discern the song, but it was loud enough to be distracting.\n\nAs for call quality, these were good enough. I called a friend during an hour-long walk, and she was able to hear me despite beeping trucks and wind. In her words, I sounded \u201cecho-y,\u201d and she could hear a lot of the ambient noise around me, but at no point was she unable to hear me. I do like that you can pair the glasses to multiple devices and have them switch between the two \u2014 that\u2019s something the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses weren\u2019t really capable of. However, this is only useful if you\u2019re getting clear glasses, as you shouldn\u2019t be wearing sunglasses indoors while on your laptop.\n\nThe right side has two action buttons. The volume rocker is on the left side. You can also see some of the directional speakers and mics.\n\nThe controls are at least easy to navigate. On the left arm, you\u2019ve got a self-explanatory volume rocker. (Though, I found myself reaching for the volume rocker on my phone far more often. Habits are hard to break, especially if you often have your phone in hand anyway.) On the right side, there are two action buttons that you can use to take or decline calls, put the device into pairing mode, or mute Alexa. If you press the back action button twice, you can launch a personalized playlist on the music streaming service of your choice. For me, I\u2019d think that\u2019d be a list full of K-pop and sad indie artists like Phoebe Bridgers and Mitski. Instead, the glasses played a list full of artists I didn\u2019t know and songs that I would never listen to.\n\nLike I said, these are more headphones than smart glasses.\n\nAlexa on your face\n\nThe main thing that\u2019s supposed to set the Echo Frames apart is the fact that they have Alexa built in. My problem here is that Alexa has never been and still isn\u2019t a particularly good voice assistant when you\u2019re on the go. It\u2019s fine at answering odd queries, setting timers, and telling you the weather \u2014 but it\u2019s much better at controlling your smart home than replacing Siri or Assistant.\n\nIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t do things. You can now use this to make non-Alexa calls and, if you have an Android phone, reply to text messages. Directions are also possible, but it\u2019s clunky. Alexa told me I\u2019d get a notification on my phone to start... but that meant tweaking my notification settings to a less preferred option. When I did get it working, it suggested I go to Bowling Green in Kentucky instead of the Manhattan train station five minutes away. Most things are still just easier (and faster) on my phone. As a result, I didn\u2019t have a lot of reasons to actually use Alexa on these glasses. That was only exacerbated by the fact that I had a pair of sunglasses instead of regular glasses.\n\nIt relies on your phone for a connection, and that\u2019s a pro and a con. So long as you have a stable Bluetooth connection and your phone has signal, you can use Alexa reliably while on the go. On the flip side, you don\u2019t have much offline usability on that front. Plus, you need to make sure the Alexa app is always open and running in the background.\n\nIt says to just ask Alexa, but I didn\u2019t find much to ask beyond the weather and timers.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s just weird to say \u201cAlexa\u201d in public. (You can change the wake word to Echo if that feels better, but for me, it did not.) This is an issue I have with nearly every pair of smart glasses with some kind of voice assistant. Earbuds are a visual and cultural signal that we all implicitly understand. If I\u2019m talking to midair with AirPods in, you can be confident I\u2019m on a call. Me talking to myself with no phone or AirPods in sight got me some odd looks from strangers \u2014 and confused looks from some of my friends.\n\nIn terms of notifications, I like that you have some control over when you get notified. There\u2019s a VIP Filter you can curate so that only select apps and contacts will notify you. The glasses will play a sound whenever you get a notification, and then you can pull your phone out to check. It won\u2019t read your texts, but I appreciate that. I don\u2019t love it when Siri takes 10 years to read out the URL to a funny link my friends send me, for instance. It does mean you have to be ruthless when setting up your VIP list, however.\n\nYou can set a VIP Filter to curate your notifications, but it\u2019s best to be ruthless here since you only hear a ping.\n\nFor testing purposes, I did try issuing a few Alexa commands while I had these at home. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn\u2019t trip up any of my Echo speakers. There is a feature where you can ask any Echo speaker you have to locate your Frames. That\u2019s nice, but at the same time, I doubt it\u2019s something most people will frequently use. As a lifelong glasses wearer, mine are always either in a case or on my nightstand because. I have a specific drawer for sunglasses. Plus, this feature relies on your glasses having a decent charge.\n\nSpeaking of charge, these held up well over the past week. My commute is around 60\u201380 minutes, depending how much the MTA wants to test me. I\u2019ve gotten about five hours of media playback and calls thus far and have about 30 percent battery left. Meanwhile, a roughly 50-minute call drained the battery about 20 percent. Charging from zero to 100 percent takes about 2.5 hours, though I\u2019m not a big fan of the charging stand\u2019s design. It took me a hot second to figure out that you\u2019re supposed to place them on the stand vertically so that the lenses are pointed straight up at the ceiling. The way the stand is designed, I\u2019d expected you\u2019d plop them in horizontally. I missed the charging case of Meta\u2019s smart glasses, which killed two birds with one stone and was a much more elegant charging solution overall.\n\nPay more for less\n\nIf you\u2019re a heavy Alexa user, I can see paying the $270 for the base model and maybe using FSA or HSA funds if you need prescription lenses. But while I like the look of the Carrera Cruiser model, this is not nearly $400 worth of tech and style, especially not when the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses start at $299 \u2014 a mere $30 more than the cheapest Echo Frames. Those get you better build quality, a surprisingly good hands-free camera for photos and video, the ability to livestream to Instagram, better audio quality, and a much better mic. Those get you the option of transition lenses, too, though the third-gen Echo Frames are at least on a similar playing field when it comes to style. Likewise, the Bose Frames Tempo and Soprano have a retail price of $249 \u2014 and can be found on sale for around $200. Those have similar battery life and better sound quality.\n\nAudio definitely leaks on these in quieter spaces.\n\nThese make some small moves in the right direction. Again, improving the range of available styles was a much-needed change. It\u2019s good to beef up the audio, but it wasn\u2019t enough of a change to make these stand above the competition or a compelling alternative to wireless earbuds. But perhaps most crucially, I wasn\u2019t convinced to use Alexa more than I otherwise would have. As it stands, I think Amazon\u2019s getting there with form. It\u2019s just not quite there with function."

Currently, two of them, on a rotating basis, act as the semifinal games for the CFP.\n\nHowever, that will expand to include quarterfinal games as of the 2024-25 season when the CFP expands to a 12-team format.\n\nHow does a team qualify for the NY6 bowl games?\n\nA selection committee ranks the best four teams in the country and selects them for the College Football Playoff semifinal games. Those teams compete for a chance to play in the National Championship.\n\nThe other four NY6 bowl games are typically given to champions from the Power Five conferences and the top-rated teams and champions from the Group of Five conferences.\n\nWhat is the College Football Playoff National Championship?\n\nThe CFP National Championship is the final game in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision season, crowning the country\u2019s best team. The winners of the two CFP semifinal games square off in this contest, usually slated for a Monday in early January.\n\nThe game, which started in 2014 after replacing the Bowl Championship Series, attracts millions of viewers. That popularity also makes it one of the most-wagered-on sporting events in the country.\n\nThe championship games are scheduled as follows for the next few years:\n\n2023-24: Jan. 8 in Houston\n\nJan. 8 in Houston 2024-25: Jan. 20 in Atlanta\n\nJan. 20 in Atlanta 2025-26: Jan. 19 in Miami\n\nAgain, you can see the schedule being pushed later into January once the CFP field expands to 12 teams in 2024-25.\n\nWhich schools have won the CFP National Championship?\n\nThe College Football Playoff National Championship has been taking place since 2015. Here are the previous winners.\n\n2022-23 season: Georgia Bulldogs\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs 2021-22 season: Georgia Bulldogs\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs 2020-21 season: Alabama Crimson Tide\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide 2019-20 season: LSU Tigers\n\nLSU Tigers 2018-19 season: Clemson Tigers\n\nClemson Tigers 2017-18 season: Alabama Crimson Tide\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide 2016-17 season: Clemson Tigers\n\nClemson Tigers 2015-16 season: Alabama Crimson Tide\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide 2014-15 season: Ohio State Buckeyes\n\nCollege bowl games FAQ\n\nHow many college bowl games are there annually?\n\nThe bowl game season lasts three weeks and consists of 43 games, including the NCAA football national championship.\n\nWhat are the New Year\u2019s Six bowl games?\n\nThe New Year\u2019s Six is a series of high-profile bowl games. They include:\n\nRose Bowl Game presented by Capital One (Pasadena, California)\n\nAllstate Sugar Bowl (New Orleans)\n\nPlayStation Fiesta Bowl (Glendale, Arizona)\n\nChick-fil-A Peach Bowl (Atlanta)\n\nGoodyear Cotton Bowl Classic (Arlington, Texas)\n\nCapital One Orange Bowl (Miami Gardens, Florida)\n\nWhat is the best time to bet on the College Football National Championship?\n\nChoosing when to bet on the NCAA football national championship comes down to risk versus reward. Making your bets when the lines are first released gives you the best odds and potential winnings but with precious little information.\n\nYou might back a team that\u2019s clearly not going to win by Week 4.\n\nThe longer you wait, the clearer the picture becomes, thanks to data and team performance, but the odds tighten up because sportsbooks are using that same information to make adjustments. You\u2019ll have a more educated choice, but the odds will be less favorable and your payout smaller."

    "body": "Walt Disney Animation\u2019s newest movie, Wish, is the culmination of the studio\u2019s celebration of its own centennial. That project stretched throughout 2023, through projects like the short Once Upon a Studio, specialized merchandise drops centered around each decade the company has been around, and the rebrand of the iconic Disney castle logo. But Wish leans so hard on celebrating the better Disney films that came before it that it doesn\u2019t have much identity of its own. It\u2019s openly a nostalgia-fest, pretty much on par with the other ways the company celebrated its 100-year anniversary.\n\nIn 2023, Disney drilled in harder than ever on looking admiringly at its own history. And why shouldn\u2019t it? The company has a full century of beloved movies, characters, and storytelling to mine for big emotion. Even people who\u2019ve outgrown Disney probably still have residual fondness for at least one of the animated movies they watched in their youth. But nostalgia-bait isn\u2019t limited to Disney\u2019s big birthday celebration: It\u2019s basically what the company has been selling for decades now.\n\nWhile living in and echoing its own past has been profitable for Disney, it isn\u2019t sustainable. And ultimately, harping so hard on its own glory days is pretty antithetical to Disney\u2019s legacy. In order to move forward, it needs to shed the nostalgia \u2014 or at least not make it the company\u2019s primary selling point.\n\nNostalgia is safe\n\nFrom a moneymaking standpoint, it\u2019s easy to see why Disney sticks to legacy-linked projects: They\u2019re all but guaranteed to make bank. Disney\u2019s live-action remakes and sequels consistently get mixed to poor reviews, but they make hundreds of millions of dollars. People will pay to see their faves on screens again, or to try to share their happy childhood memories with their own children.\n\nAt least, they will until they get tired of the diminished returns. The live-action remakes might make a lot of money in the short run, but all they\u2019re really doing is reiterating what Disney has done in the past, without meaningfully adding to the original movies\u2019 legacy.\n\nRemember the Disney sequel era? When Disney pumped out cheap direct-to-home-video titles based on every beloved Disney movie from The Fox and the Hound to The Lion King? Disney tries not to. After John Lasseter took over as Disney\u2019s chief creative officer in 2006, he canned the whole DTV department a year later, reportedly denouncing the way cheaply made sequels diminished the Disney brand. Even though Disney loves to celebrate its past, the studio rarely references this era.\n\nEven with a much higher budget and flashier visuals, the live-action remake fad Disney has been riding for the past decade is still contributing to the feeling of nostalgia oversaturation. And the studio\u2019s many spinoffs and reboots don\u2019t help, either. Some of these legacy projects have been good, but even so, the sheer volume of them just doesn\u2019t seem built to last.\n\nOne of the most recent Disney live-action projects announced is a rendition of 2016\u2019s animated hit Moana \u2014 a great movie that hasn\u2019t even really had a chance to build its own legacy. The kids who watched it when it first came out are mostly still kids. But Disney is now assuming that anything it makes will have an instant legacy, without actually letting the nostalgia naturally brew on its own.\n\nDisney\u2019s brand management of Star Wars, Marvel, Fox, the Muppets, and a host of other properties only emphasizes this oversaturation. The Disney empire stretches far and wide these days, and characters like Baby Yoda and Tony Stark sit alongside Mickey Mouse and Cinderella in theme parks, on Disney Plus promotional material, and on Bob Iger\u2019s X header. Disney plays up \u201cDisney Magic\u201d as part of its brand. But when every major franchise in America is lumped together as Disney magic, what\u2019s left?\n\nInnovation is Disney\u2019s real legacy\n\nOver the past 100 years, Disney has taken some big, risky swings, and has fumbled many, many times. From the dark and dreary Black Cauldron, which almost bankrupted the studio in 1985, to the off-kilter adventure movies of the early 2000s, the studio\u2019s mold-breaking passion projects have often been megaflops. But at the same time, some of the company\u2019s most memorable movies have stemmed from these risks.\n\nThe original 1940 Fantasia was one of Walt Disney\u2019s most ambitious passion projects turned box-office failures, but the Sorcerer Mickey short is as iconic as the mouse himself. Lilo & Stitch was so damn weird that the filmmakers basically hid it from the rest of the company; it ended up making back more than three times its budget, and more importantly, turning Stitch into one of the studio\u2019s most memorable characters. And even The Little Mermaid, the film that kickstarted the Disney Renaissance, was a risk; a big Broadway-style musical of its type just hadn\u2019t been done in animation before.\n\nAfter all, Walt Disney himself famously pushed for progress and innovation, especially in the studio\u2019s creative endeavors, even when that translated into poor financial decisions. What\u2019s made his studio so special over the past century is how it\u2019s looked forward, trying new things even in the face of failure and taking chances that other production houses couldn\u2019t afford or risk. The company\u2019s biggest legacy isn\u2019t the princesses, the theme parks, or even Mickey Mouse: It\u2019s how all those elements started out as daring projects that no one else was doing.\n\nAnd yet Disney and its fans apparently keep forgetting that, and keep clinging to the past with such ardor that it does their idol\u2019s legacy a disservice.\n\nThere\u2019s a time and place for the past\n\nNostalgia isn\u2019t a bad thing, nor is it entirely at odds with Walt Disney. Even in his quest for innovation, Walt was a nostalgic guy who idealized \u201cthe good old days,\u201d to the point where he modeled the entrances of his theme parks after how his hometown looked at the turn of the 20th century. I, certainly, am not immune to Disney nostalgia. I love Disney. I have multiple Disney-themed plushies. I teared up when I watched Once Upon a Studio. I launched an entire yearlong content package so I could celebrate Disney.\n\nBut nostalgia is a potent ingredient, and it works best in the Disney recipe for success when it\u2019s on the side: in celebratory shorts, theme-park parades, and collectible merchandise. Not when it\u2019s the main offering. For most of the past century, Walt Disney Studios was a movie studio first, and a storefront, streaming service, and theme-park empire second.\n\nIt feels like that balance has shifted over the last decade. And if Disney wants to last another century, and make things that actually spark new nostalgia down the line, it should go back to embracing fresh, different ideas.\n\nHardcore Disney fans aren\u2019t always keen on new things. They cry out for a return to their favorites, the memory of watching a Disney movie for the first time. Maybe that means demanding animated Disney movies have proper villains again. Maybe it means asking for more musicals \u2014 or fewer of them. Maybe it\u2019s lamenting the loss of traditional 2D animation. Maybe it\u2019s specifically missing the animated musical sequences of the Disney Renaissance. There are even people who yearn for a return to the animal-focused movies of the 1970s. Whatever that Disney draw is, it\u2019s different for every single person.\n\nAnd because Disney fans have so many separate, individualized desires, it\u2019s impossible for the company to focus on meeting every single one of them. Besides, more often than not, even though people cry out for the good old days, what they\u2019re really missing is the feeling of discovering something new \u2014 that first viewing of a movie that will become a lasting favorite. Trying to check off all the items on a checklist that doesn\u2019t even really describe what people want\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make good movies. It barely makes tolerable ones.\n\nWith 100 years of creative life under its belt, Walt Disney Studios has a lot to be proud of. But Mickey Mouse didn\u2019t become a staple overnight. Before Mickey was an icon, before the Disney Princess brand was even a thing, before Disney owned a million other entertainment companies, Disney filmmakers were trying daring things, while making a lot of costly mistakes along the way. But each of those mistakes was an opportunity, a legacy of its own that helped usher in the great movies the studio is known for.\n\nThat\u2019s not a message that executives and shareholders want to hear. But you don\u2019t get to a hundred-year legacy by playing it safe. You need to have faith and trust in storytelling, in the creative minds behind the great movies, in the power of progress. And a little pixie dust doesn\u2019t hurt, either."

    "body": "Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch\n\nShare All sharing options for: Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch\n\nNeed a new way to watch sports? Twitch might be exactly what you\u2019ve been looking for.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that fans have historically consumed sports through live events and cable TV, but as media consumption has shifted, many \u2014 especially in younger generations \u2014 have sought out sports content on social platforms.\n\nTwitch in particular has become a platform where sports streamers and fans have flocked. During the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020, athletes and sports leagues around the world joined the platform to stream video games when live sports were temporarily on hiatus \u2014 and years later, some of them are still active. WNBA player Aerial Powers regularly streams herself playing games like NBA 2K and Apex Legends, while Argentinian former soccer player Sergio Ag\u00fcero uses his channel to livestream Kings League and Queens League games. Organizations like the NBA, the NFL, and the UFC have their own Twitch channels where they promote and share content. For instance, the UFC runs watch-along streams hosted by former mixed martial artist, boxer, and kickboxer Jens Pulver.\n\nPolygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!\n\nIn recent years, Twitch has introduced a TwitchSports channel as well as a stand-alone sports category to help users find live sporting events and sports-related content. On the stand-alone sports category page \u2014 which, as of publication, has 2.7 million followers \u2014 users can find creators commentating and analyzing various sports, reaction and watch-along streams, some live sports feeds, and streams of creators playing sports video games. Take a look and you\u2019ll see everything from motorsports and soccer to tennis, volleyball, and even pickleball.\n\nEnterpriseAppsToday reported that in 2023, Twitch\u2019s \u201cSports\u201d category registered around 8 million hours of watch time. YPulse survey research from April found that 66% of Gen Zers are tuning into platforms like Twitch to follow their favorite sports. \u201cIn contrast to the more spectator-oriented sports watching of earlier generations, Gen Z has evolved the experience into an interactive digital experience through social and streaming platforms,\u201d says Anastasia Pelot, YPulse\u2019s content marketing manager.\n\nWhile livestreams of major league games are less common to find on Twitch due to broadcast rights, some leagues \u2014 nationally and globally \u2014 have experimented with streaming games in recent years. The NBA signed a deal with Twitch in 2017 to stream minor league games while giving fans the chance to interact with each other. The two also teamed up in 2019 for a separate deal to exclusively stream USA Basketball games globally. When Amazon began airing Thursday Night Football games last fall, Nielsen reported a total viewership figure of 13 million for its first exclusive game, which included U.S. Prime Video subscribers who streamed on Twitch.\n\nTwitch creator EsfandTV, who requested to go by Esfand for this story, is a streamer with 1.2 million followers who follow not only for gaming content, but for his sports streaming as well. He says that broadcast rights are one of the aspects hindering Twitch from becoming a full-blown sports streaming platform. Leagues still own the rights when it comes to where sports are aired, and Esfand says they need to adapt if they want to reach young and international sports fans.\n\n\u201cThe NBA is king,\u201d Esfand says. \u201cWhen it comes to hockey, the NHL is king. But what\u2019s happening is these different leagues, they are the boss. They\u2019re the governing body. They have all the rights to everything and when it comes to content, they can be in control.\u201d\n\nEsfand says if done properly, a league can partner with a streamer that has a large audience and find a way to allow rights to reduce the barrier to entry for users. \u201cYou can\u2019t just block it out in certain markets,\u201d Esfand says. \u201cWhen I did a stream [of a football game], I think Canada couldn\u2019t watch. Most of Europe couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d\n\nSome leagues have partnered with streamers and have yielded successful results: LiveMode and FIFA partnered with Brazilian streamer Casimito to broadcast the 2022 World Cup on Twitch in Latin America, while the Men in Blazers podcast hosted its popular live watch-along shows for some World Cup matches in the U.S. Earlier this year, Casimito also struck a deal to stream the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup on his channel. The NBA also signed a deal in 2021 with Alexandre \u201cGaules\u201d Borba Chiqueta and Budweiser to stream games in Brazilian markets.\n\n\u201cThese are the things that, if they\u2019re done the right way, you are now attracting the younger audience who is not watching cable TV as much anymore,\u201d Esfand says.\n\nIn place of regularly streaming games, Esfand has found other ways to engage with fans on his channel. Esfand\u2019s Tailgate Tour, where he visits college towns and showcases college football culture \u2014 everything from the tailgating atmosphere to the energy inside the stadium \u2014 resonates strongly with young and global fans, especially those who might not be familiar with American college traditions.\n\nIn April, he livestreamed Esfand\u2019s Draft Night Extravaganza on Twitch. The broadcast coincided with the first day of the NFL draft and featured a mix of Twitch creators like Will Neff and Erobb221 as well as current and former NFL players including Austin Ekeler, Micah Parsons, and Kenny Vaccaro, where they provided analysis and commentary on draft picks.\n\n\u201cI have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn\u2019t football, but they\u2019re actually huge football fans\u201d\n\nIn some cases, fans preferred Esfand\u2019s show to the traditional broadcast. \u201cI havent watched or cared about football in like 10 years but i still watched this whole stream and loved it,\u201d one viewer commented on YouTube, where the Twitch stream was uploaded after airing.\n\nAnother user wrote, \u201cI love all things football and I pretty much had the draft on TV muted while watching your stream.\u201d\n\nEsfand says he feels fortunate he\u2019s been able to stream more sports content on his channel over the last few years, to the point where people have recognized him solely for his football content. He adds that it\u2019s been interesting seeing fans evolve from those that were fans of his gaming streams to ones who are sports fans, or discovering gaming fans who are also sports fans.\n\n\u201cI have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn\u2019t football, but they\u2019re actually huge football fans,\u201d Esfand says. \u201cA big part of Twitch is that people like watching streamers they can relate to. Because what happens is, it\u2019s not just about the streamer; it\u2019s also about the streamer\u2019s chat. Now they are getting involved in the community, whether it\u2019s just through chat itself or through Discord.\u201d\n\nAlex Casassovici, founder and CEO of Azarus, a company that works with online creators to enhance the streaming experience, says that livestreaming sports and sports-related content on platforms like Twitch creates a more intimate experience for streamers and fans alike.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re looking at is either a very curated kind of managed channel, and more grassroots-like, creator-led experiences,\u201d Casassovici says. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly something that can be differentiated when it comes to streaming.\u201d\n\nTwitch seems to see value when it comes to investing in sports streamers. A few years ago, the platform launched the Sports Accelerator Program to support sports content creators wanting to get into \u201csports talk,\u201d like podcasts, talk shows, reaction streams, sidecasts, watch-alongs, and more, through live workshops and by providing opportunities to network and expand their viewership.\n\nU.K.-based Keira Megan, who goes by keirameganxx on Twitch and was previously part of the Sports Accelerator Program, has been on the platform for about a year and a half with a focus on soccer and motorsports like Formula 1. While Formula 1 has always been primarily popular in Europe, it\u2019s seen growth among new fans in the United States in recent years, thanks in part to docuseries like Netflix\u2019s Drive to Survive.\n\nWhile she doesn\u2019t stream actual races or games due to broadcast rights, Megan hosts watch-along streams for fans who want to hear her commentary. Megan says that while she doesn\u2019t have as many followers on Twitch as she does on her YouTube channel, there are elements of Twitch she prefers to YouTube, including the ability to be herself and engage with fans more closely.\n\n\u201cPeople want to know what you want to say,\u201d Megan says. \u201cThey come into my Twitch channel and ask me about the race. They asked me three days later about a [soccer] match. They want to talk about it. I think Twitch is good for that. I think it\u2019s good for one-on-one. I find that Twitch is where I\u2019m the most engaged with my audiences, and they feel closest to me.\u201d"

    "body": "Listen to this story: Have feedback on the audio version of this story? Let us know!\n\nTypically, matter made of the same kinds of atoms arranged in the same way has the same properties. But tiny specks called quantum dots are special. They can contain the same molecules yet have different colors and other qualities depending on their size. The ability to make a whole rainbow of quantum dots simply by tweaking their size makes the dots highly useful. They light up TV screens and help doctors see inside the body. Now, the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry honors three scientists who discovered and created quantum dots.\n\nOne of those scientists is Moungi Bawendi. He\u2019s a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. The second winner is chemist Louis Brus. He\u2019s based at Columbia University in New York City. The final winner is Alexei Ekimov. This physicist now works at Nanocrystals Technology, Inc., in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.\n\nThe trio will split a prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or about $1 million. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the honor October 4.\n\nChemist Moungi Bawendi (left), chemist Louis Brus (middle) and physicist Alexei Ekimov (right) have split the 2023 Nobel prize in chemistry. MIT, Columbia University, Nexdot\n\nA new kind of material\n\n\u201cQuantum dots are a new class of materials, different from molecules,\u201d said Heiner Linke. A member of the Nobel committee, he spoke at the award announcement.\n\nQuantum dots are each a few billionths of a meter across. At such a tiny scale, their qualities are governed by the weird laws of quantum mechanics. Those quantum laws rule that changing the dots\u2019 size alters their properties. That includes how the dots interact with light and electricity. It also includes their magnetic properties and at what temperature they melt.\n\nOne useful quality that changes with a quantum dot\u2019s size is its color. Usually, \u201cif you want to make different colors with molecules, you would choose a new molecule,\u201d Linke said. That is, a new set of atoms arranged in a different structure.\n\nBut changing a quantum dot\u2019s size can change its color without changing its molecules. Quantum dots give off fluorescent light of different colors when they are bathed in laser light. Smaller dots give off bluer light. Bigger dots give off redder light.\n\nDots of the same size made from different materials may give off slightly different colors. Quantum dots are usually made from semiconductors. Such materials include graphene, selenite or metal sulfides. By adjusting the sizes and materials of quantum dots, chemists can alter their properties for a huge range of uses.\n\nPossible after all\n\nScientists suspected that nanoparticles\u2019 sizes could alter their properties nearly a century ago. But at the time, it seemed impossible to actually make such particles. To do that, researchers would need a material with a perfect crystal structure. They\u2019d also have to be able to control the size of that tiny speck extremely precisely. So precisely, in fact, that they\u2019d have to sculpt the particle one layer of atoms at a time.\n\nThen, in the early 1980s, Ekimov and Brus each showed this could be done. The two did not work together. Ekimov created quantum dots with glass. Adding copper chloride to the glass produced tiny crystals. Ekimov then showed that the size of those crystals was linked to the color of the glass.\n\nBrus made a similar discovery. He showed that there was a link between size and color for nanosize particles floating in a solution or in a gas.\n\nThose discoveries stirred up intense interest in how such dots could be used. But making quantum dots for specific uses would require precisely controlling the dots\u2019 size.\n\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nA decade later, Bawendi devised a method to do just that. His technique allowed him to stop the growth of tiny crystals in a solution when they reached a desired size. Here\u2019s how it worked. He first injected chemicals into a solution that instantly formed tiny crystals. Then, he tweaked the temperature of the solution to halt the crystals\u2019 growth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply honored and surprised and shocked by the announcement this morning,\u201d Bawendi said October 4. He spoke at an MIT news conference. \u201cI\u2019m especially honored to share this with Lou Brus,\u201d Bawendi said of his mentor. \u201cI tried to emulate his scholarship and his mentoring style as a professor myself when I came to MIT.\u201d\n\nBawendi started working on quantum dots after meeting Brus. The two worked at Nokia Bell Labs, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J. There, researchers needed high-quality quantum dots to study the physics of nanoparticles.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I wanted to make the best quantum dots possible for application,\u201d Bawendi said. \u201cIt was because we needed to make the best possible quantum dots to study them.\u201d It took years of trial and error to work out the method.\n\nIn this microscope image, quantum dots light up mouse intestines. Red and green represent proteins illuminated by fluorescing quantum dots. Provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Image by Thomas Deerinck and Mark Ellisman/National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research\n\nApplications abound\n\nBawendi\u2019s work made it possible to manufacture quantum dots with specific sizes \u2014 and therefore specific properties. This opened up a world of possible uses for the dots.\n\nFor one thing, quantum dots can be used to subtly change the color of LED lights. This can dramatically improve the lights\u2019 energy efficiency.\n\nQuantum dots are also useful in medicine. They can be injected into the body and attached to cells from the body\u2019s immune system. Such cells swarm cancerous tissues. By tagging the cells with fluorescent quantum dots, surgeons can spot even hard-to-see tumors inside the body.\n\nQuantum dots can also be tuned to absorb different colors of light. So they could be used to build solar panels that soak up sunlight well in different conditions. The dots may even be used to build quantum computers. Such computers promise to run much faster than any normal computer ever could.\n\nThis year\u2019s chemistry Nobel is well-deserved, says Warren Chan. He\u2019s a biomedical engineer and chemist at the University of Toronto in Canada. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who built the foundation,\u201d Chan says of the winners. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that the field is getting credit for really changing the world.\u201d\n\nChan and his colleagues found one of the first uses for quantum dots in the 1990s. Their group used quantum dots to tag cells in lab experiments. But the Nobel committee doesn\u2019t just look at past impacts of a discovery, Chan notes. They also consider the effects a discovery may have in the future. And quantum dots could have a whole medley of uses not yet explored. Chan\u2019s team, for instance, is now using quantum dots to detect infections such as flu and HIV.\n\n\u201cI was absolutely thrilled to see this,\u201d says Judith Giordan. She\u2019s the president of the American Chemical Society. \u201cWe have three people recognized who brought this technology from a dream, a hope, a theoretical construct \u2026 all the way through synthesis and manufacture.\u201d"

No seats, however, may be more sizzling than those occupied by two head coaches in the NFC South, one in the NFC North and another (surprisingly) in the NFC West.\n\nHere is the hottest seat on each NFC team as determined by Yardbarker NFL writers.\n\nNFC East\n\nDALLAS COWBOYS | Cornerback Trevon Diggs: In September, Diggs suffered a season-ending ACL injury. His replacement, DaRon Bland, has wowed us with an NFL-record five pick-sixes. There's no way Bland can go back to slot corner in 2024, so the heat will be on Diggs next season as a probable replacement for Stephon Gilmore at left cornerback.\n\nNEW YORK GIANTS | Quarterback Daniel Jones: Out for the season with an ACL injury, Jones has no way to dissuade Giants ownership from taking a quarterback high in the QB-rich 2024 NFL Draft. New York can (and will) get out of his $160M contract in 2025.\n\nPHILADELPHIA EAGLES | Wide receiver Quez Watkins: Philadelphia\u2019s supposed No. 3 receiver has a measly four catches for 21 yards. While he missed five games with a hamstring injury, Olamide Zaccheaus and Julio Jones combined for 132 yards receiving and three touchdowns.\n\nWASHINGTON COMMANDERS | Owner Josh Harris: He oversaw the controversial \u201cProcess\u201d as owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. He\u2019ll need a better plan this offseason when \u201cI\u2019m not Dan Snyder\u201d stops working. At 4-8, the Commanders are floundering in his first season of ownership. \u2014 Bruce Ewing\n\nNFC West\n\nARIZONA CARDINALS | Quarterback Kyler Murray: The inconsistent Murray has five more games this season to prove to a new front office and coaching staff that he is the long-term answer at quarterback. If he doesn\u2019t show them what they want to see, the Cardinals have the draft capital (including two first-round picks) to land a franchise quarterback at the top of the QB-rich 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nLOS ANGELES RAMS | Wide receiver Cooper Kupp: At his peak, he was one of the best offensive players in the league, but age (30) and injuries (appearing in 16 of a possible 28 games the past two seasons) have hurt his production. He has been a non-factor over the past five games (12 catches for 127 yards) while young receivers Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell have stepped up.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO 49ERS | Head coach Kyle Shanahan: The 49ers have done almost everything possible under Shanahan except win a Super Bowl. Fair or not, not winning a title with a stacked roster \u2014 especially on offense (Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Brock Purdy, George Kittle) \u2014 would be a massive disappointment. His job is in zero danger, but his rep may be.\n\nSEATTLE SEAHAWKS | Quarterback Geno Smith: The Seahawks passed on drafting a QB in 2023 and re-signed Smith, but he has taken a significant step back. Entering Thursday's game against Dallas, his completion percentage was down from 2022 (69.8 to 65.4 percent) despite the impressive offensive weapons around him. Seattle has an out in his contract after this season that would only carry a $17.4 million dead-cap number, per Spotrac. \u2014 Adam Gretz\n\nNFC North\n\nCHICAGO BEARS | Head coach Matt Eberflus: The Bears have only one division win during Eberflus' tenure and his seven wins are the fewest by a Bears head coach through his first 29 games. In his second season as HC, the defense has improved, but positive results are hard to come by behind a lackluster offense ranked 19th in yards (323.2) and 21st in points per game (20.2).\n\nDETROIT LIONS | Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn: The Lions finished near the bottom of the NFL in points against (31st and 28th) the past two seasons and are on pace to do so again for the third time in as many years under Glenn (24th, 23.5). Furthermore, the unit has regressed in 2023, with opponents averaging 29 points per game since Week 7 (five games).\n\nGREEN BAY PACKERS | Wide receiver Christian Watson: The popular choice to emerge as the team's No. 1 wideout, he has underachieved in his second season, outshined by fellow 2022 draftee Romeo Doubs (seven TDs) and rookie Jayden Reed (five TDs). Watson had his best game in Week 12 (five receptions, 94 yards, one TD), but was nearly invisible before that, recording 16 catches (257 yards) and two TDs over seven games.\n\nMINNESOTA VIKINGS | Running back Alexander Mattison: He has floundered in his first season as the starter, producing zero rushing TDs on a career-best 13.2 attempts a game and ranking 22nd among qualified backs in yards per carry (3.8). He's still getting more snaps than second-year RB Ty Chandler, but the Vikings will likely look for a replacement this offseason if Mattison doesn't show more. \u2014 Mike Santa Barbara\n\nNFC South\n\nATLANTA FALCONS | Quarterback Desmond Ridder: The Falcons have a golden path toward a division crown, but Ridder\u2019s two-interception performance against the Saints in Week 12 was another reminder Atlanta isn\u2019t a legitimate contender with him. He\u2019ll finish the season leading the Falcons, who will probably get a home playoff game, but the clock is ticking on Ridder\u2019s time as an NFL starter.\n\nCAROLINA PANTHERS | General manager Scott Fitterer: Owner David Tepper should have the hottest seat, but he isn\u2019t going to fire himself. Instead, when he runs out of people on the sidelines to fire, he\u2019ll take out his frustration on a GM (partly) responsible for constructing the least impressive roster in football.\n\nNEW ORLEANS SAINTS | Head coach Dennis Allen: New Orleans' 5-6 record against the league\u2019s easiest schedule is bad. What's worse, however, is running back Alvin Kamara\u2019s concerning claim after a 24-15 loss to the Falcons that the team doesn\u2019t have an identity. Allen \u2014 who has a 20-44 record as head coach of the Raiders and Saints \u2014 needs a playoff appearance or there could be big changes in New Orleans.\n\nTAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS | Head coach Todd Bowles: At 4-7, the Bucs are only a game back of first in the division, but they are fading fast, going 1-6 in their past seven games. The team\u2019s lapses on defense (363.7 YPG/27th) \u2013 supposedly Bowles' area of expertise \u2013 are most concerning. \u2014 Eric Smithling"

    "body": "As we trot into Turkey Day week, only three more regular-season weeks remain until the fantasy football playoffs. Every decision \u2014 from the tough starts to the difficult sits; the savvy waiver adds to the costly drops \u2014 can ultimately decide whether your team is a contender or a pretender. Our Week 12 fantasy RB rankings for standard leagues will help guide you to the right moves and hopefully land you a big \"W\" for which to be thankful.\n\nTrade deadlines have passed in most leagues, so the majority of fantasy owners must soldier on toward the home stretch with the main core they have built to this point. On a positive note, we have no byes to worry about this \u2014 just plenty of short turnarounds, some potential weather concerns, and of course, the dreaded injury bug. Fortunately for us, we have been ahead of the curve with sleepers and breakouts all season, so we're more prepared to weather any storm than the average fantasy Joe.\n\nLet's get right to our Week 12 RB rankings so you can fully prepare for Thanksgiving week and put out a lineup with backs who will feast like the rest of us.\n\nMORE: Watch NFL RedZone live with Sling (50% off first month)\n\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 12?\n\nNone! It's a Thanksgiving miracle! Not only do we not have any byes to worry about this week, but we also have NFL action on four different days (Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday).\n\nWEEK 12 STANDARD RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nIn some ways, however, a bye-free week at this stage of the season presents more challenges than ever. Whereas byes make some start 'em, sit 'em decisions no-brainers, 16-game weeks make it a lot easier to get lineup decisions wrong. Don't worry \u2014 we'll steer you in the right direction and keep you apprised of all the information you'll need throughout the week.\n\nWEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS:\n\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers\n\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 12?\n\nAs always, Christian McCaffrey (@ Seahawks in Week 12) heads the list as the most matchup-proof running back in the NFL. Right behind him, Austin Ekeler (vs. Ravens) will look to bounce back after an uncharacteristically rough showing in Green Bay last week.\n\nAgainst the Commanders last week, Saquon Barkley (vs. Patriots) looked as good as we've seen him this season (140 total yards, two TDs). The Pats have surrendered 116 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs this season, so we like Barkley to pick up where he left off this Sunday (drive up that free-agency value, 'Quon!).\n\nYou don't see running mates cracking the top five very often, but we had to make the exception for David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (vs. Packers). Entering Week 11, Green Bay had surrendered nearly 140 all-purpose yards per game to RBs. Between Detroit's o-line, the Lions' high-flying offensive attack, and the ruthless 1-2 punch DMont and Gibbs have been this season, the feast could be on very early for Dan Campbell's guys.\n\nTake a collective sigh of relief, Tony Pollard (vs. Commanders) owners! TP looked solid against Carolina last week, averaging 5.1 yards per carry and finally getting into the end zone for the first time since Week 1. We have the Cowboys back just outside our top five with a juicy matchup against a Washington D that just got lit up by Saquon and the G-men.\n\nRaheem Mostert (@ Jets) should continue to eat for Miami, with rookie De'Von Achane (knee) unfortunately getting hurt almost immediately after returning from IR (more on that later). Gang Green hasn't been nearly as good against the run as it has been against the pass, as Jets opponents have averaged 139 rushing yards per game over the past two weeks. 'Fins backup Salvon Ahmed also landed on the IR with a foot injury, so consider stashing Jeff Wilson Jr. as a handcuff.\n\nRounding out the top 10, the trio of Travis Etienne (@ Texans), Josh Jacobs (vs. Chiefs), and Breece Hall (vs. Dolphins) will be looking to bounce back from disappointing Week 11 outings on the ground. All three of these backs have been mostly solid, and none have much to worry about in terms of backfield competition.\n\nWEEK 12 FANTASY ADVICE:\n\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\n\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 12?\n\nSleep on Rhamondre Stevenson (@ Giants) at your own peril. 'Mondre has accumulated 231 yards from scrimmage and a TD over New England's past two games, and the Pats are coming off bye. Washington just carved the G-men up like a turkey on the ground last week, surrendering a whopping 174 yards and a TD. Gobble gobble.\n\nGet Kyren Williams (@ Cardinals) right back into your lineup the moment Los Angeles activates him from IR. Arizona just made Devin Singletary look like Barry Sanders, so Williams (ankle) should enjoy a triumphant return to the field. Keep rolling with Alexander Mattison (vs. Bears), too, against another below-average run defense.\n\nWelcome to the top 25, Zach Charbonnet (vs. 49ers)! With Kenneth Walker III's oblique injury comes opportunity for the rookie, who already looked strong in the month leading up to Seattle's narrow Week 11 loss to the Rams. Sure, Charbs' 69-yard effort in Los Angeles last week was a bit underwhelming, but we love his upside with a full game as the Seahawks' bell-cow.\n\nSpeaking of bell-cow backs, things are looking very promising for the short-term workload of Green Bay's AJ Dillon (@ Lions). Veteran Aaron Jones (knee) and rookie Emanuel Wilson (shoulder) both got hurt in Week 11, so Dillon should be the main man in Motown for the Pack. Power backs have enjoyed the most success against the Lions, as evidenced last week by Chicago's Roschon Johnson averaging 5.0 yards per carry and D'Onta Foreman finding paydirt.\n\nWEEK 12 DFS:\n\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\n\nWho are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 12?\n\nWe don't quite have the intestinal fortitude to bench Derrick Henry (vs. Panthers), but we must absolutely temper our expectations with the dude at this point. Over the past two weeks, he has tallied just 64 total yards on 23 touches (2.8 yards per touch). Carolina served as Tony Pollard's get-right game last week, so fire King Henry up if you have him. If he falters against the Panthers, you better have a backup plan moving forward (picking up Tyjae Spears as insurance is a good place to start).\n\nBoth Darrell Henderson and Royce Freeman (@ Cardinals) would be decent dart throws in a week filled with byes, but their floors in a zero-bye week seem too low to trust them if Kyren Williams is back and at 100 percent. The matchup is juicy, but we have no idea what to expect from a touch-share perspective, so these guys are no better than desperation, TD-dependent flexes.\n\nSpeaking of guys coming back from injury, we saw Khalil Herbert (@ Vikings) return to the field for Chicago against the Lions last week. However, his performance left a lot to be desired. He finished with just 35 yards on 16 carries and wound up vastly overshadowed by Justin Field's 100-yard rushing effort. Even worse, D'Onta Foreman scored the Chi's lone rushing TD on the afternoon.\n\nI don't care what your team looks like \u2014 you shouldn't be starting Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Titans). They weren't awful against Dallas last week on a per-touch basis, but neither finished with more than 12 touches. Even worse, no Carolina back has enjoyed a 60-yard rushing game since Oct. 15. Bad offensive line, negative game scripts, awful coaching \u2014 it's all bad, man!\n\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 12?\n\nSecond-year Seahawks back Kenneth Walker III suffered an oblique injury in Week 11 that the ever-hip Pete Carroll referred to as \"legit.\" KW3 has a better chance of missing multiple weeks than he does at suiting up for Seattle's Thanksgiving Day game against Fred Warner and the 49ers. If Zach Charbonnet somehow finds himself on your waiver wire, an early Merry Christmas to you if you have the FAAB or a high waiver priority.\n\nThe hits just keep on coming for the Packers' Aaron Jones, who suffered a knee injury but seems to have at least caught a break in the sense that he didn't tear his ACL. However, even a moderate MCL sprain could mean a multi-week absence for the injury-prone veteran back, especially in a lost season for the 4-6 Pack. Rookie Emanuel Wilson also hurt his shoulder in Week 11, so AJ Dillon could be getting the keys to Green Bay's backfield castle (although it's more of an oversized shack, at this point).\n\nDolphins rookie De'Von Achane, who looked like the runaway Offensive Rookie of the Year earlier this season, looked to have aggravated his MCL injury upon his Week 11 return against the Raiders. Achane has a chance to return for Miami's Week 12 tilt with the Jets on Friday, but we wouldn't be surprised if the 7-3 'Fins play it safe and keep him out until he's back to 100 percent. Meanwhile, Miami placed backup Salvon Ahmed on IR with a foot injury, so Jeff Wilson Jr. could be back in play as a handcuff stash.\n\nBears veteran D'Onta Foreman injured his ankle in Week 11. He could miss some time now that Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson are both back in action for Chicago. The best runner on the Bears, however, is QB Justin Fields when he's active.\n\nTexans back Dameon Pierce returned to practice late last week, but he remained out with his ankle injury against the Cardinals. We could see him return to the field this weekend, but for now, we're keeping him off our rankings until we hear more positive news. Either way, it seems Devin Singletary is the new RB1 in this breakout offense.\n\nWe'll be updating these standard RB rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.\n\nFantasy RB Rankings Week 12: Who to start, sit at running back\n\nRankings based on standard, non-PPR scoring\n\nRank Player\n\n1 Christian McCaffrey, 49ers @ Seahawks\n\n2 Austin Ekeler, Chargers vs. Ravens\n\n3 Saquon Barkley, Giants vs. Patriots\n\n4 David Montgomery, Lions vs. Packers\n\n5 Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions vs. Packers\n\n6 Tony Pollard, Cowboys vs. Commanders\n\n7 Raheem Mostert, Dolphins @ Jets\n\n8 Travis Etienne, Jaguars @ Texans\n\n9 Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. Chiefs\n\n10 Breece Hall, Jets vs. Dolphins\n\n11 Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots @ Giants\n\n12 Alvin Kamara, Saints @ Falcons\n\n13 Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs @ Raiders\n\n14 Brian Robinson Jr., Commanders @ Cowboys\n\n15 Bijan Robinson, Falcons vs. Saints\n\n16 Jonathan Taylor, Colts vs. Buccaneers\n\n17 James Conner, Cardinals vs. Rams\n\n18 D'Andre Swift, Eagles vs. Bills\n\n19 Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Steelers\n\n20 Derrick Henry, Titans vs. Panthers\n\n21 Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Colts\n\n22 Kyren Williams, Rams @ Cardinals\n\n23 Alexander Mattison, Vikings vs. Bears\n\n24 Gus Edwards, Ravens @ Chargers\n\n25 Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks vs. 49ers\n\n26 Javonte Williams, Broncos vs. Browns\n\n27 AJ Dillon, Packers @ Lions\n\n28 Jerome Ford, Browns @ Broncos\n\n29 Devin Singletary, Texans vs. Jaguars\n\n30 Kareem Hunt, Browns @ Broncos\n\n31 James Cook, Bills @ Eagles\n\n32 Jaylen Warren, Steelers @ Bengals\n\n33 Najee Harris, Steelers @ Bengals\n\n34 Khalil Herbert, Bears @ Vikings\n\n35 Tyler Allgeier, Falcons vs. Saints\n\n36 Chuba Hubbard, Panthers @ Titans\n\n37 Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots @ Giants\n\n38 Latavius Murray, Bills @ Eagles\n\n39 Roschon Johnson, Bears @ Vikings\n\n40 Joshua Kelley, Chargers vs. Ravens\n\n41 Keaton Mitchell, Ravens @ Chargers\n\n42 Ty Chandler, Vikings vs. Bears\n\n43 Dameon Pierce, Texans vs. Jaguars\n\n44 Royce Freeman, Rams @ Cardinals\n\n45 Jeff Wilson Jr., Dolphins @ Jets\n\n46 Rico Dowdle, Cowboys vs. Commanders\n\n47 Antonio Gibson, Commanders @ Cowboys\n\n48 Miles Sanders, Panthers @ Titans\n\n49 Tyjae Spears, Titans vs. Panthers\n\n50 Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Chiefs @ Raiders\n\n51 Dalvin Cook, Jets vs. Dolphins\n\n52 Zack Moss, Colts vs. Buccaneers\n\n53 Kenneth Gainwell, Eagles vs. Bills\n\n54 Tony Jones Jr., Cardinals vs. Rams\n\n55 Elijah Mitchell, 49ers @ Seahawks\n\n56 Jaleel McLaughlin, Broncos vs. Browns\n\n57 Justice Hill, Ravens @ Chargers\n\n58 Chase Edmonds, Buccaneers @ Colts\n\n59 Boston Scott, Eagles vs. Bills\n\n60 Tank Bigsby, Jaguars @ Texans\n\n61 Jamaal Williams, Saints @ Falcons\n\n62 Samaje Perine, Broncos vs. Browns\n\n63 Matt Breida, Giants vs. Patriots\n\nWeek 12 RB fantasy projections, rankings from Draft Sharks\n\nDraft Sharks projections for the new week will update every Tuesday and be constantly adjusted throughout the week\n\nWe're proud to offer SN Fantasy readers an exclusive look at Draft Sharks\u2019 award-winning projections and rankings every week.

Gray was fantastic in a surprise relief appearance, throwing three scoreless innings with three strikeouts and just one hit allowed.\n\nThe Diamondbacks' offense struggled to string together hits and couldn't cash in when they had runners in scoring position.

Mitch Garver flew out to center and Jonah Heim grounded out to third, where Evan Longoria made a nice play and throw to get the runner in time.\n\n9:35 p.m.: Top of 6th \u2014 Corey Seager flew out to center to start the inning but Brandon Pfaadt's night will be over after he issued a free pass to Adolis Garcia.

Despite an impromptu appearance, the Rangers pitcher has sent down the first six batters he has faced. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Alek Thomas both grounded out and Evan Longoria popped out to first in foul play.\n\n9:19 p.m.: Top of 5th \u2014 Brandon Pfaadt survives a lead-off walk to Nathaniel Lowe unscathed. He struck out Josh Jung, then Leody Tavares lined out to third and Marcus Semien grounded out to third to end the inning.\n\nFourth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0\n\n9:07 p.m.: Bottom of 4th \u2014 Jon Gray didn't need much time to settle in. He struck out Gabriel Moreno, Christian Walker grounded out to third and Tommy Pham flew out to center for an easy 1-2-3 inning.\n\n9:03 p.m.: Bottom of 4th \u2014 An interesting development: Max Scherzer is being pulled from the game after just 36 pitches and three scoreless innings. Scherzer tried to take the mound for the bottom of the fourth but it appears he is being bothered by a lower back injury. It is unknown if the injury is correlated to the comebacker he took off of his lower back in the second inning. RHP Jon Gray will get the ball.\n\nMax Scherzer left tonight's game with back tightness pic.twitter.com/JQOP6WvlkC \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 31, 2023\n\n8:58 p.m.: Top of 4th \u2014 Brandon Pfaadt bounces back the way Arizona needed him to. He sends Evan Carter, Mitch Garver and Jonah Heim down in order, striking out Garver for Pfaadt's third K of the day.\n\nThird inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0\n\n8:51 p.m.: Bottom of 3rd \u2014 Max Scherzer assures the Diamondbacks don't answer right away, getting through the bottom of the 3rd with little resistance. He struck out Evan Longoria and got Geraldo Perdomo to fly out to right before issuing a two-out walk to Corbin Carroll. Carroll advanced to second on a wild pitch, but Scherzer got Ketel Marte to fly out to left to end the frame.\n\n8:45 p.m.: Top of 3rd \u2014 Brandon Pfaadt got Adolis Garcia to strike out swinging to end the inning. The damage was limited to three runs.\n\n8:43 p.m.: Top of 3rd \u2014 Corey Seager rips a two-run home run! The Rangers produce some two-out magic as Seager smokes an inside changeup 421 feet over the right field wall to give Texas a 3-0 lead.\n\n8:41 p.m.: Top of 3rd \u2014 Marcus Semien comes up clutch with a single to left center! The star 2B has been struggling this postseason but he delivered here, driving in Nathaniel Lowe to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.\n\n8:39 p.m.: Top of 3rd \u2014 Brandon Pfaadt struck out Josh Jung swinging and got Leody Tavares to ground out to second but Nathaniel Lowe advanced to third. He is 90 feet away with two outs and Marcus Semien is coming to the plate.\n\n8:36 p.m.: Top of 3rd \u2014 Nathaniel Lowe gets the Rangers going right away with a double to right center field.\n\nSecond inning: Rangers 0, Diamondbacks 0\n\n8:30 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd \u2014 Lourdes Gurriel Jr. popped out to second, bringing Alek Thomas to the plate with two outs. Thomas ripped a line drive back at Max Scherzer, which ricocheted perfectly to 3B Josh Jung who made a laser throw to first to get Thomas out in time. What a bizarre inning.\n\n8:27 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd \u2014 Adolis Garcia on the defensive end! Tommy Pham singled to right field and Christian Walker tried to score from second, but Garcia \u2014 who has one of the best outfield arms in baseball \u2014 hosed him at home plate to save a run. Pham advanced to second on the throw.\n\nChristian Walker is thrown out by Adolis Garcia after blowing through the stop sign! \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\uded1\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: FOX pic.twitter.com/wXM9RbieFp \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 31, 2023\n\n8:25 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd \u2014 Christian Walker smoked a first-pitch fastball off the wall to right center for a double to lead off the bottom of the second.\n\n8:22 p.m.: Top of 2nd \u2014 Rangers star rookie Evan Carter led off the top of the second with a hard-hit single to right center, but Mitch Garver topped a grounder to Brandon Pfaadt for a 1-4-3 double play. Jonah Heim flew out to center to end the inning. Pfaadt has only needed 18 pitches to get through his first six batters.\n\nFirst inning: Rangers 0, Diamondbacks 0\n\n8:15 p.m.: Bottom of 1st \u2014 Max Scherzer got Corbin Carroll to ground out to short, but he walked Ketel Marte to give the Diamondbacks the first baserunner of the game. Scherzer almost immediately avoided any trouble, forcing Gabriel Moreno to ground into a 5-4-3 double play two pitches later to end the inning.\n\n8:08 p.m.: Top of 1st \u2014 Brandon Pfaadt breezes through the top of the Rangers' order with ease. Marcus Semien popped out to right, Corey Seager grounded out to first base on a first-pitch sinker and Adolis Garcia flew out to center. Pfaadt only needed 10 pitches to get through the top of the first.\n\nPregame\n\n3:29 p.m.: After only scoring one run in Game 2, the Rangers will make a slight tweak to the lineup. Adolis Garcia will slide up to the No. 3 spot, with Evan Carter hitting clean-up. As Texas PR mentioned, Carter is the fifth-youngest player in World Series history to bat fourth, joining Juan Soto, Ty Cobb, Miguel Cabrera and Claudell Washington.\n\nRHP Max Scherzer will get the start.\n\n3:10 p.m.: The Diamondbacks will have Corbin Carroll return to the top of the lineup after leading off with Ketel Marte in Game 2. RHP Brandon Pfaadt will get the ball to start.\n\nBrandon Pfaadt and Game 3.

    "body": "Product design is in a moment of profound change and redefinition as technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and spatial computing dramatically affect computing experiences. AI, especially, may have only minor impacts on interface design but will significantly impact the holistic product or ecosystem experience. Spatial computing, on the other hand, will change human-computer interactions and unmoor our understanding of what a computer is.\n\nIn this innovation cycle, product design requires a wider perspective of platforms and interconnections between technologies, creating a strong need for technologists and designers to be in the process together.\n\nFor successful products and businesses, innovation is perpetual. There is a never-ending search to find the next new thing that enhances the user experience, extends product reach, expands revenue, or all three simultaneously. Product design makes innovation less daunting and increases chances for success because it is a multidisciplinary process with structures and frameworks to catalyze innovation. Technologists have a role in the process that expands beyond simply validating the technology or concept, which is their customary responsibility. Before discussing the nontraditional ways technologists participate in product innovation, let\u2019s conceptually examine innovation and product design.\n\nThe word innovation has a simple meaning \u2014 to introduce something new or a novel method of doing something \u2014 yet we frequently inflate it to mean something magical, grandiose, and world-changing. Innovation can just as easily be mundane and straightforward. The key to innovation is being \u201cnew.\u201d The \u201cnew\u201d can be localized to a team, product, process, or business unit. The \u201cnovel\u201d can be well-known and established practices not incorporated into your workflow or product. Sometimes, innovation comes from closing small gaps and isn\u2019t always a grand eureka moment.\n\nInstead of forcing a technology onto a product, the design process flows to the technologies. In this way, the technology becomes a natural solution.\n\nProduct design is a process and not a discipline or deliverable. It is (understandably) easy to limit the scope of product design to color choices, content layout, and aesthetics. Too often, design is minimized to only the act of making user interfaces pretty. Product design is much deeper and broader in scope than visual design assets. For example, product design can give direction and focus to a business strategy, user experience strategy, or technology explorations.\n\nThe process establishes a guide rail throughout any innovation initiative. The core of product design is decision-making with an astute instinct for making the best decisions at the most opportune time. Product design helps reduce risk and leads to more effective innovation through quality decision-making.\n\nA progressive role for technologists\n\nTechnologists play a strategic role in product innovation and should bring a metaphysical perspective in addition to being punctilious. Our job is to communicate the essence of a technology and think strategically about the application of technologies to problem spaces. We are most constructive when we translate the technicals of \u201chow to make X do Y\u201d to \u201cthese are the types of products and services realizable with technology X.\u201d\n\nFor most technical leads and software developers, this is a mode inversion from our traditional tactical and direct interaction with technology. The context switch from daily build-and-operate is challenging but is paramount to developing successful and innovative products. We are uniquely positioned to generate strategic insights translated from dense technical minutiae that drive innovative business cases and product experiences.\n\nA technology innovation must solve a business problem, such as improving operational efficiency, growing existing revenue streams, or generating new ones. The problem space may be customer-facing (e.g., how can we deliver a new feature?) or internal-facing (e.g., how can we make a process more efficient?). The problem is the paramount concern. The specific technologies or innovations used to solve the problem are often less critical. We cannot lose perspective of the business needs; otherwise, the activities become too academic or a paid hobby.\n\nAn ordinary domestic analogy is hanging a picture. The hole size, bracket, or tools used to hang the picture are immaterial as long as the picture is on the wall and straight. The specifics of the process and technologies are only important as they pertain to how well they solve the problem, the costs to do so, and the overall end user experience.\n\nProduct innovation is experimental and should not always be expected to yield productive results. It requires a learning curve and patience, as the outcomes are often ambiguous and unknown. Business leadership can struggle with this perspective because it is indefinite (in terms of results and timelines), and it is challenging to translate pure technology innovation into value creation. A gap opens between technology and product teams wherein technology teams strain to articulate the capabilities and value of a technology innovation, leading to unfilled promises and the perception of \u201ctechnology for the sake of technology\u201d or quips like \u201ca solution looking for a problem.\u201d\n\nThe current hype cycle in AI serves as a great concrete example. For technology or product executives, the challenge is how to do more than check the AI box \u2014 it\u2019s about how to meaningfully incorporate AI into a product. Instead of forcing a technology onto a product, the design process flows to the technologies. In this way, the technology becomes a natural solution.\n\nAs experts on a technology or technology stack, we can communicate abstract insights or contribute in more conceptual contexts. Technologists add value to the product design process by sharing their expertise on a technology\u2019s characteristics. Designers use this information to shape and exploit technologies in the visual and interaction design process. In this way, technologists inform new interaction models, interface metaphors, and product channels. This involvement gives confidence and conviction to the promises of design.\n\nThink of digital technologies as a material like paint, stone, or wood. For artisans to create with materials, they must understand the material\u2019s ontology and phenomenology. An artist must know the differences between oil, acrylic, or watercolor paints because each material has different properties that affect how and what can be created. Technologists must \u201cfind the grain\u201d of a technology. In this way, they become an intermediary between the abstract nature of design and the pedantic nature of technology. This philosophical perspective is especially important when a product is in a growth stage or when using emerging technologies.\n\nRegardless of whether your product is growing or in a stable stage or employs established or emerging technologies, integrating technologists into the product strategy and design process enriches the final outcome. There is a technology perspective extending beyond the operations and mechanics of the code \u201cfactory floor,\u201d which provokes innovation. Sometimes this leads to small, impactful moments of innovation \u2014 and sometimes it is a brilliant revolution."

    "body": "The NBA is one of the most popular sports to bet on in the US. NBA prop bets are an easy way to jump into basketball betting.\n\nProposition bets, or props, are easy to understand, numerous, and cover both player props and team props to give you plenty of variety.\n\nBelow, we look at betting NBA props at the best NBA betting sites and share some key information to make informed bets.\n\nWhat are NBA props?\n\nA prop bet is a side wager on an aspect of a game that usually doesn\u2019t tie directly to the result. In the NBA, prop bets deal with both players and teams.\n\nSome examples of NBA player props are:\n\nHow many points a player will score\n\nNumber of rebounds a player will have\n\nHow many assists a player will get\n\nRebounds and assists combined\n\nPoints, rebounds, and assists combined\n\nHow many steals a player will get\n\nNumber of three-pointers made\n\nSome examples of NBA team props include:\n\nWhich team will reach 10 points first\n\nWhich team will have the highest-scoring period\n\nWhich team will score first\n\nWhich team will win the first half\n\nWhich team will win the second half\n\nWill there be a fourth-quarter comeback victory\n\nAll of the best sports betting sites have their selection of prop bets for each NBA game, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best suit your needs.\n\nHow to bet on NBA props\n\nThe first step to betting on NBA props is opening an account at an online sportsbook. The process is simple, free, and doesn\u2019t take very long. Below are the steps to opening a new account at an online sportsbook.\n\nChoose your sportsbook: Any state with legal online sports betting has a variety of sportsbooks. If you aren\u2019t sure which sportsbooks best fit your needs, research and read our reviews on each. And don\u2019t forget that you can have an account with more than one. Once you decide which sportsbook you\u2019re interested in, follow the link from our site to qualify for the best new customer welcome bonus.\n\nRegister for an account: At the top of the homepage of the sportsbook website, you will find a button that says \u201cregister\u201d or \u201csign up.\u201d Click that, and you\u2019ll be taken to a form you must fill out. It will ask for personal information such as your name, phone number, email address, last four digits of your Social Security number, and more.\n\nAccept the terms and conditions: Before finalizing your account information, you must accept the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions. We recommend you read through these to understand the rules your sportsbook will enforce regarding bets, especially for the sports you intend to wager on. The terms and conditions are also available on the sportsbook website for you to read at any point.\n\nGet your bonus: At this point, you can accept your welcome bonus. Be sure to read through the bonus requirements before accepting anything. If a bonus code is needed, which you can find on our website, this is where you will input it during the registration process.\n\nMake a deposit: Now that you\u2019ve signed up for an account, you can start funding your bankroll by making a deposit. Most legal sportsbooks have a variety of ways you can add funds to your account, such as through your bank or an e-wallet.\n\nStart betting: Go to the basketball section of your sportsbook and select the NBA. From there, you can choose individual games and make bets like money lines, point spreads, totals, props, futures, and more.\n\nHow to read NBA props odds\n\nAt first glance, all the positive and negative numbers at US sportsbooks can be daunting. The good news is they are easy to read once you understand what you see.\n\nNegative numbers, such as -110, represent how much money you need to wager to win $100. In many cases, such as a moneyline bet, the negative number also indicates which side of the bet is the favorite to win.\n\nFor example, if you were to bet on LeBron James scoring over 15.5 points in a contest at -125 odds, you\u2019d need to wager $125 to win $100. If you did and your bet was correct, then you\u2019d take home $225, which is your original $125 stake returned to you plus your $100 in profit.\n\nPositive numbers, like +145, show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. If you were to bet $50 on Giannis Antetokounmpo to have over 7.5 rebounds and the odds were +130 at the time you finalized your bet slip, you would win $65 in profit if your bet wins.\n\nPositive numbers also indicate which side of the bet is the underdog in the eyes of the oddsmakers.\n\nRemember that you can bet as little or as much as you want, and your payout will be calculated based on your wager amount and the odds at the time you make your bet.\n\nTypes of NBA props\n\nYou can make two main prop bets on the National Basketball Association:\n\nTeam props\n\nPlayer props\n\nTeam props are typically focused on statistical accomplishments by a particular team and rarely on the game\u2019s result. You\u2019ll often come across NBA team prop bets that are based on a team\u2019s points, such as the first team to reach 20 points, the first team to score in a game, or whether the total points by both teams in a contest will end up being odd or even.\n\nTeam props, also known as \u201cgame props,\u201d don\u2019t rely on individual players but rather on the team as a whole. Player props, on the other hand, are driven by individual performance.\n\nThese individual props are focused on statistical milestones during a game. The most popular bets typically focus on points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goals. You can also bet on combination wagers, such as points and rebounds together.\n\nIn most cases, you can bet on traditional statistics for the five starters on each team.\n\nSee more:\n\nTips for betting on NBA props\n\nEvery bettor should develop their strategies, but we do have three tips you can use for NBA props.\n\nPay attention to player and team news: Oddsmakers use various information to develop their lines for games and players, and you should, too. Keep tabs on player news and injuries, when top players are being rested, how they performed in recent games, and more. You can find value in player and team props by gathering information from multiple sources and tracking how players and their teammates perform. For example, if one of the starting guards is questionable for a game, you might want to consider the other guard for increased points or assists since they\u2019ll likely handle a heavier load.\n\nKeep an eye on usage and minutes: Even slight increases to a player\u2019s average minutes can make a difference when betting player props, especially later in the season when aging veteran players tend to rest more. Keep yourself informed on usage and minutes trends for the players you\u2019re considering betting on, and use them to your advantage. Remember that some of the best players in the NBA were once on the bench for most games until small increases in their playing time gave them a chance to shine.\n\nShop for the best lines: This tip applies to every bet you make. Using multiple sportsbook accounts lets you find the best odds for every NBA prop bet. Even the smallest differences, like one sportsbook having odds at +125 and another at +135, can make a difference in your profit. By shopping for the best lines, you can make smarter bets and find the best value.\n\nRelated Pages:"

    "title": "The UK just laid out new rules for the internet \u2014 it only gets harder from here",
    "author": "Jon Porter",

    "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952736/uk-online-safety-act-ofcom-illegal-harms-guidelines",
    "body": "After the Online Safety Act\u2019s arduous multiyear passage through the UK\u2019s lawmaking process, regulator Ofcom has published its first guidelines for how tech firms can comply with the mammoth legislation. Its proposal \u2014 part of a multiphase publication process \u2014 outlines how social media platforms, search engines, online and mobile games, and pornography sites should deal with illegal content like child sexual abuse material (CSAM), terrorism content, and fraud.\n\nToday\u2019s guidelines are being released as proposals so Ofcom can gather feedback before the UK Parliament approves them toward the end of next year. Even then, the specifics will be voluntary. Tech firms can guarantee they\u2019re obeying the law by following the guidelines to the letter, but they can take their own approach so long as they demonstrate compliance with the act\u2019s overarching rules (and, presumably, are prepared to fight their case with Ofcom).\n\n\u201cWhat this does for the first time is to put a duty of care on tech firms\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat this does for the first time is to put a duty of care on tech firms to have a responsibility for the safety of their users,\u201d Ofcom\u2019s online safety lead, Gill Whitehead, tells The Verge in an interview. \u201cWhen they become aware that there is illegal content on their platform, they have got to get it down, and they also need to conduct risk assessments to understand the specific risks that those services might carry.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to require that sites be proactive to stop the spread of illegal content and not just play whack-a-mole after the fact. It\u2019s meant to encourage a switch from a reactive to a more proactive approach, says lawyer Claire Wiseman, who specializes in tech, media, telecoms, and data.\n\nOfcom estimates that around 100,000 services may fall under the wide-ranging rules, though only the largest and highest-risk platforms will have to abide by the strictest requirements. Ofcom recommends these platforms implement policies like not allowing strangers to send direct messages to children, using hash matching to detect and remove CSAM, maintaining content and search moderation teams, and offering ways for users to report harmful content.\n\nLarge tech platforms already follow many of these practices, but Ofcom hopes to see them implemented more consistently. \u201cWe think they represent best practice of what\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s not necessarily applied across the board,\u201d Whitehead says. \u201cSome firms are applying it sporadically but not necessarily systematically, and so we think there is a great benefit for a more wholesale, widespread adoption.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also one big outlier: the platform known as X (formerly Twitter). The UK\u2019s efforts with the legislation long predate Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, but it was passed as he fired large swaths of its trust and safety teams and presided over a loosening of moderation standards, which could put X at odds with regulators. Ofcom\u2019s guidelines, for example, specify that users should be able to easily block users \u2014 but Musk has publicly stated his intentions to remove X\u2019s block feature. He\u2019s clashed with the EU over similar rules and reportedly even considered pulling out of the European market to avoid them. Whitehead declined to comment when I asked whether X had been cooperative in talks with Ofcom but said the regulator had been \u201cbroadly encouraged\u201d by the response from tech firms generally.\n\n\u201cWe think they represent best practice of what\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s not necessarily applied across the board.\u201d\n\nOfcom\u2019s regulations also cover how sites should deal with other illegal harms like content that encourages or assists suicide or serious self-harm, harassment, revenge porn and other sexual exploitation, and the supply of drugs and firearms. Search services should provide \u201ccrisis prevention information\u201d when users enter suicide-related queries, for example, and when companies update their recommendation algorithms, they should conduct risk assessments to check that they\u2019re not going to amplify illegal content. If users suspect that a site isn\u2019t complying with the rules, Whitehead says there\u2019ll be a route to complain directly to Ofcom. If a firm is found to be in breach, Ofcom can levy fines of up to \u00a318 million (around $22 million) or 10 percent of worldwide turnover \u2014 whichever is higher. Offending sites can even be blocked in the UK.\n\nToday\u2019s consultation covers some of the Online Safety Act\u2019s least contentious territory, like reducing the spread of content that was already illegal in the UK. As Ofcom releases future updates, it will have to take on touchier subjects, like content that\u2019s legal but harmful for children, underage access to pornography, and protections for women and girls. Perhaps most controversially, it will need to interpret a section that critics have claimed could fundamentally undermine end-to-end encryption in messaging apps.\n\nThe section in question allows Ofcom to require online platforms to use so-called \u201caccredited technology\u201d to detect CSAM. But WhatsApp, other encrypted messaging services, and digital rights groups say this scanning would require breaking apps\u2019 encryption systems and invading user privacy. Whitehead says that Ofcom plans to consult on this next year, leaving its full impact on encrypted messaging uncertain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not regulating the technology, we\u2019re regulating the context.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another technology not emphasized in today\u2019s consultation: artificial intelligence. But that doesn\u2019t mean AI-generated content won\u2019t fall under the rules. The Online Safety Act attempts to address online harms in a \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d way, Whitehead says, regardless of how they\u2019ve been created. So AI-generated CSAM would be in scope by virtue of it being CSAM, and a deepfake used to conduct fraud would be in scope by virtue of the fraud. \u201cWe\u2019re not regulating the technology, we\u2019re regulating the context,\u201d Whitehead says.\n\nWhile Ofcom says it\u2019s trying to take a collaborative, proportionate approach to the Online Safety Act, its rules could still prove onerous for sites that aren\u2019t tech juggernauts. BBC News notes that Ofcom\u2019s initial set of guidance is over 1,500 pages long. The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit behind Wikipedia, tells The Verge that it\u2019s proving increasingly challenging to comply with different regulatory regimes across the world, even if it supports the idea of regulation in general. \u201cWe are already struggling with our capacity to comply with the [EU\u2019s] Digital Services Act,\u201d the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s VP for global advocacy, Rebecca MacKinnon, says, pointing out that the nonprofit has just a handful of lawyers dedicated to the EU regulations compared to the legions that companies like Meta and Google can dedicate.\n\n\u201cWe agree as a platform that we have responsibilities,\u201d MacKinnon says, but \u201cwhen you\u2019re a nonprofit and every hour of work is zero sum, that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\nOfcom\u2019s Whitehead admits that the Online Safety Act and Digital Services Act are more \u201cregulatory cousins\u201d than \u201cidentical twins,\u201d which means complying with both takes extra work. She says Ofcom is trying to make operating across different countries easier, pointing toward the regulator\u2019s work setting up a global online safety regulator network.\n\nPassing the Online Safety Act during a turbulent era in British politics was already difficult. But as Ofcom begins filling in its details, the real challenges may be only beginning."

Developer Niantic has said once you have spent 70 Pumpkin Tickets on Jack-o\u2019-Head armor upgrades, further improvements will then only regular crafting materials. As such, this is a good number to aim for if you prefer to continue upgrading after the event ends.\n\nJack-o\u2019-Head armor skill explained\n\nOnce equipped, the Jack-o\u2019-Head armor has the skill Solidarity (Pumpkin Hunt). This is a party-based skill where having multiple players with the skill active increases attack power. During the Halloween event, this effect is increased by five.\n\nAs such, this is a rather situational skill, as not only do you need to be hunting with other players, but doing so during the Halloween event (which ends after Oct. 31) will see the most benefit.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible this skill will appear in future armor pieces to increase its potency (such as during next year\u2019s Halloween event), so crafting one now could be a sound investment for those looking to play with other hunters. Otherwise, for solo players, it might be simply a piece to add to your collection, especially if the ability to transmog (change the appearance of your armor) comes to the game one day.\n\nWhere to find pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku in Monster Hunter Now\n\nA Halloween-themed Kulu-Ya-Ku holding a pumpkin rock will \u201cappear in larger numbers than usual\u201d from Saturday, Oct. 28 at 9 a.m. local time until the end of Oct. 31.\n\nBy its very nature, Kulu-Ya-Ku appears in all three habitats (Forest, Desert, and Swamp) meaning they can appear anywhere on the map.\n\nBeyond the novelty of battling a Halloween-themed monster, taking down these special pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku will reward you with Pumpkin Tickets.\n\nNiantic has confirmed any pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku tagged with paintballs during the event will continue to drop Pumpkin Tickets after the event ends \u2014 giving you extra time if needed.\n\nLooking for more guides?

    "title": "49ers cap space 2024: Why Chase Young trade may not be a pure rental for San Francisco",
    "author": "Jacob Camenker",

    "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/49ers-cap-space-2024-chase-young-trade/924c310ff72c00dd54a9cf2c",
    "body": "The 49ers made the biggest move ahead of the 2022 NFL trade deadline when they acquired running back Christian McCaffrey from the Panthers. They once again made a splash ahead of the 2023 trade deadline when they traded for Commanders pass rusher Chase Young.\n\nYoung was among the most notable players dealt ahead of the 2023 trade deadline. The No. 2 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft is in the midst of a breakout season, totaling five sacks in eight games and generating a solid 18 pressures while getting into the backfield often for the Commanders.\n\nBut as Washington jettisoned its top two defensive ends, Young and Montez Sweat, the 49ers found themselves positioned to pounce. They traded a 2024 third-round pick to get the talented defender and reunite him with his college teammate and fellow No. 2 pick, Nick Bosa.\n\nYoung should provide a boost to a 49ers defense that ranks just 22nd this season in sacks per game at 2.3. But many are wondering whether Young will end up being a rental for the 49ers or more of a long-term investment.\n\nThat will all depend on how San Francisco manages its salary cap in 2024.\n\nMORE DEADLINE: Live tracker | Grading every trade\n\nOn the surface, it may look hard for the 49ers to re-sign Young long-term; in reality, the team has more flexibility to do so than it would initially appear. Here's why.\n\n49ers cap space 2024\n\nAs it stands, the 49ers don't project to have much cap space in 2024. In fact, OverTheCap lists San Francisco as having just $1,479,772 in available space. That is good for the seventh-least in the NFL.\n\nThat said, the 49ers are equipped to increase their cap space with relative ease. How? Well, they have at least one player on their roster, Randy Gregory, who has an eight-digit salary but doesn't have any guaranteed money left on his deal. That means that the 49ers could release him without taking a dead-cap hit, which is a financial term for when a player no longer on the roster is still owed guaranteed money; that would open up $14 million more in cap space.\n\nElsewhere, the team has 10 other players on the active roster set to have cap hits of at least $14.1 million who could restructure or extend their contracts.\n\nWhen NFL teams restructure contracts, they typically take a player's base salary \u2014 which is accounted for in a one-year duration \u2014 and turn it into some sort of signing bonus. That bonus is allowed to be prorated over the duration of the contract, so it spreads what would be a high, one-year cost out into a moderate cost over several years.\n\nTypically, players who have their contracts restructured have high cap hits and high base salaries. So, in looking at the 49ers' highest-paid players for 2024, there are a few options for restructures, as you can see below.\n\nPlayer 2024 cap hit Base salary Dead cap hit Trent Williams $31.7 million $20.1 million $29.9 million Arik Armstead $28.6 million $17.4 million $25.9 million Deebo Samuel $28.6 million $21 million $26.5 million Fred Warner $24.5 million $15.3 million $25.6 million George Kittle $22 million $13.4 million $18.9 million Charvarius Ward $17.9 million $12.6 million $17.2 million Javon Hargrave $15.5 million $8.9 million $33.4 million Nick Bosa $14.6 million $1.1 million $76.5 million Brandon Aiyuk $14.1 million $14.1 million $14.1 million Christian McCaffrey $14.1 million $11.8 million $8.6 million\n\nSo, if any of Williams, Armstead, Samuel, Kittle or Warner were to restructure their contracts or if a player like Aiyuk got an extension, that would push some of the 49ers' cap hits into future years. That could prove a worthwhile move if it allows for the team to keep Young and keep its Super Bowl window open with the ultra-cheap Brock Purdy at quarterback.\n\nOf course, the team could also release some of its players, like Gregory, to open up space. It doesn't seem likely that any of the players listed above would be cut or traded as all are owed hefty guarantees and come with big dead-cap hits; but the 49ers could trim from the margins of the roster if they need just a bit more cap space to keep Young around.\n\nBut a restructuring of contracts will almost certainly happen in San Francisco during the offseason; it's just a matter of which and how many players will get that treatment and whether those funds will be allocated to Young or other portions of the roster.\n\nIYER: Grading the Chase Young to the 49ers trade\n\nChase Young contract projection\n\nAssessing how San Francisco can try to keep Young also includes looking at what Young's value might be on the open market. It's likely that the 24-year-old will get a large payday as a free agent, but it's just a matter of how big it will be.\n\nSpotrac.com projects that Young should make about $17.8 million annually on a four-year deal. However, that seems a bit light considering that it includes a couple of interior defensive linemen \u2014 Dre'Mont Jones and Zach Allen \u2014 among his closest comparisons.\n\nIt seems more likely that Young will be paid to his potential as well, considering that he missed a lot of time in Years 2 and 3 with injuries. Thus, he may end up being highly paid in terms of average annual value (AAV) but he may see lower-end guarantees.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, the deal that seems most likely to suit him is one similar to the extension that the Packers gave Rashan Gary.\n\nGary is set to have an AAV of $24 million over the duration of that contract while making $96 million over four years. However, only $34.6 million of that deal is guaranteed, as Gary was inconsistent to start his career and dealt with a torn ACL in 2022.\n\nRashan Gary contract value\n\nLength 4 years Total value $96 million AAV $24 million Guarantees $34.6 million\n\nYoung could hypothetically crack $100 million if he's allowed to hit the open market, but the Gary deal projection seems like a sensible ballpark for now.\n\nOf course, the 49ers could also try to slap him with the franchise tag if they're worried about paying him and Bosa big bucks long-term. That was worth just under $20 million last season, so that may look like San Francisco's best avenue toward keeping its Super Bowl window ajar.\n\nHowever, one-year deals are often complicated to fit into smaller amounts of salary cap space, so the 49ers would likely prefer to get a long-term agreement in place with Young to keep him. At the end of the day, franchising him may not be worth the hassle \u2014 even if he is easily the team's best free agent in 2024.\n\nMORE: Why the 49ers traded for Chase Young, explained\n\n49ers free agents 2024\n\nYoung's quest to earn a deal with the 49ers could be aided by the fact that they don't have many key players set to be free agents in 2024.\n\nAs it stands, only 15 other 49ers are set to be free agents in 2024. Just two of them, Tashaun Gipson and Clelin Ferrell, are full-time starters; and Young eventually figures to take over as starter for Ferrell.\n\nBelow is the full list of 49ers free agents for the 2024 offseason.\n\nBrandon Allen, QB\n\nOren Burks, LB\n\nSam Darnold, QB\n\nRoss Dwelley, TE\n\nJon Feliciano, C\n\nClelin Ferrell, EDGE\n\nDemetrius Flanagan-Fowles, LB\n\nTashaun Gipson, S\n\nKevin Givens, DT\n\nJauan Jennings, WR\n\nJavon Kinlaw, DT\n\nRay-Ray McCloud, WR\n\nTerrance Mitchell, CB\n\nMatt Pryor, OT\n\nCharlie Woerner, TE\n\nChase Young, EDGE\n\nSo, while the 49ers will have some key role players like Sam Darnold, Jauan Jennings and Oren Burks set to get new deals, the team's free-agent class is short on high-end talent. That will make it easier for them to focus on keeping Young if they so desire.\n\nAs such, fans should view his acquisition as more of an audition to remain with the 49ers than a pure rental."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nEmily Ratajkowski\u2019s latest photo shoot has sparked backlash among plus-size models and activists, who claim it promotes unhealthy narratives about body image.\n\nThe supermodel, 32, recently shared several images from her photo shoot with M Le Monde magazine. For the fashion editorial photographed by Oliver Hadlee Pearch, Ratajkowski posed in a variety of looks featuring denim jeans and flowing tops. However, it was the second image that caught the attention of her Instagram followers.\n\nIn the photo, Ratajkowski is seen wearing a pair of low-rise, wide-leg denim jeans double her size. She showed off her toned figure as the oversized pair of jeans fell at her feet. As she held up the waistband of the jeans with one arm, Ratajkowski stood in one leg of the pair of jeans to highlight the noticeable size gap.\n\nThe photo shoot - which was styled by Charlotte Collet and creative directed by Jean-Baptiste Talbourdet-Napoleone - instantly sparked backlash after Ratajkowski shared the images to Instagram. In her comments section, thousands of users criticised both Ratajkowski and the team behind the photo shoot for the \u201cout of touch\u201d image and claimed the photo shoot was \u201cfatphobic\u201d.\n\nFamous plus-size models and inclusivity advocates - such as Tess Holliday, Kelly Augustine, Stephanie Yeboah, Letticia Munniz, and Sarah Chiwaya - have called out the photo for emphasising Ratajkowski\u2019s thinness in a pair of pants that would typically be reserved for someone who is plus-size.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for those jeans in the second photo if you could just please return them that would cool. Tysm,\u201d Holliday commented under Ratajkowski\u2019s post.\n\n\u201cThat second photo is such godforsaken trash,\u201d wrote Chiwaya. \u201cIn the year of our lord 2023?? STILL??? Yikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the fatphobic hell is that second picture?\u201d a third user commented, while someone else said: \u201cThat second pic is so out of touch and ignorant but the comments are chef\u2019s kiss.\u201d\n\nPlus-size models have long advocated for more inclusive sizing - both in stores and on the runway. However, luxury brands and labels often avoid creating plus-size fashion over claims that it\u2019s too expensive to make. \u201cDesigners won\u2019t make plus sizes unless it\u2019s for a photo opp where a thin person can be quirky,\u201d another person pointed out.\n\nMany people were especially surprised by the \u201cdistasteful\u201d photo shoot considering Ratajkowski has published a book of essays about feminist empowerment and the objectification of women\u2019s bodies, titled My Body. \u201cNot sure how you think wearing oversized jeans made for a much larger person and accentuating your smallness promotes healthy body image like you preach in your books/social media,\u201d an Instagram user said.\n\nSince she shared snaps from the photo shoot over the weekend, Ratajkowski has not yet commented on the backlash. Despite the controversial editorial, the model has previously spoken out against body-shaming. In her book of essays, Ratajkowski discusses bodily autonomy and exploitation in the modelling industry. \u201cEvery woman I know - doesn\u2019t matter what they look like, or if they\u2019ve commodified their image or not - knows what it feels like to be looked at, to be rejected, to get attention for how they look,\u201d she told The Independent in 2021.\n\nBack in 2019, Ratajkowski defended her friend against body-shaming trolls after their bodies were compared on Instagram. The model shared a bikini-clad post to promote her swimwear line, Inamorata, but several users accused Ratajkowski of sharing the photograph to make her body look \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\nIn response, Ratajkowski commented: \u201cI love my friend\u2019s body and both her and I think she looks great here! And I\u2019m proud she\u2019s rocking my suits. All these haters are crazy. Just because you\u2019re used to seeing one body type on the internet doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s the only kind that should be considered \u2018beautiful\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile the body positivity movement has made waves over the past 10 years, this year in fashion was especially devoid of inclusivity or plus size models. According to Vogue\u2019s Business Size Inclusivity Report, only 0.6 per cent of looks shown throughout the autumn/winter 2023 fashion season were modelled by plus-size people.\n\nDespite the fact that the plus-size clothing market is expected to reach $288bn this year, according to Future Market Insights, advocates have maintained that they\u2019re unable to purchase clothing that\u2019s both sustainable and inclusive. \u201cI have to wear fast fashion and high street to major red carpet moments, and that\u2019s great, but I want the option to wear high end items of my choosing and it\u2019s not available,\u201d Holliday told Elle UK in 2019. \u201cBut it\u2019s either that or I run around naked. Plus-size fashion is not there yet.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Ratajkowski and M Le Monde for comment."

    "body": "After the most aggressive monetary-tightening campaign in four decades, academics and economic practitioners are running autopsies on what could have prevented the cost-of-living crisis and how to ensure the same mistakes won\u2019t be repeated.\n\nMarkets have scrambled to price in high-for-longer interest rates, with a new war in the Middle East adding yet more risk to an already uncertain outlook confronting central bankers as they gather for their penultimate meetings of a tumultuous year.\n\nThe policy navel-gazing is centering around three debates. How much flexibility central banks can allow in reaching their inflation targets, the effectiveness of asset purchases in the policy mix, and the merits of monetary and fiscal coordination.\n\nBloomberg surveyed economists from around the world to gather views on those three debates. Their verdict: Central banks won\u2019t break their economies in a rush to hit inflation targets, QE will be used more sparingly in the future, and fiscal policy risks countering the work of monetary authorities.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says\u2026 \u201cA long period of galloping price gains, and fears that the last yards back to target could be most painful for workers, have reignited the debate about whether central banks should aim for a higher rate of inflation. That\u2019s a conversation worth having. But for monetary policymakers, the imperative of retaining credibility means the right time for it is after inflation is back at target, not before.\u201d \u2014 Tom Orlik, chief economist\n\nRethinking Targets\n\nSo long as people believe prices will get back toward 2%, central bankers have some leeway in deciding how aggressive they need to be in pursuing that goal.\n\nEconomists covering 16 of the world\u2019s most important central banks say policymakers will allow more time to bring inflation back to target if it means less damage to their economies. The Bloomberg special survey also shows that a sizable minority sees them going even further, accepting price pressures that are either slightly too strong or too weak \u2014 as long as expectations remain anchored.\n\nOlivier Blanchard, a former IMF chief economist, has long argued in favor of raising the inflation target, and former European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio has also embraced the idea. But it\u2019s a controversial view and only possible from a position of credibility, which means central banks would likely have to get inflation back to 2% first.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake of the first order to think you can change a goal you have set if you can\u2019t achieve it,\u201d according to Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel.\n\nGlobal trends suggest inflation will be stronger than in the past, with former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney among those saying rates won\u2019t return to pre-pandemic lows.\n\nOne lesson Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s No. 2 official, draws from the latest inflation episode is that policymakers mustn\u2019t assume that looking through supply shocks \u2014 as text books suggest \u2014 is the optimal response. She recommends they be ready to react preemptively, even when inflation hasn\u2019t yet spun out of control.\n\nThey may be called into action soon on that front, should an escalation in the conflict in the Middle East hit oil deliveries.\n\nWhen the next big global slowdown comes, though, flexibility may be needed the other way. Europe\u2019s eight-year experiment with negative rates ended with mixed reviews last summer as to whether it was all worth it.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements argues that there\u2019s room for greater tolerance for moderate shortfalls even if they\u2019re persistent, because \u201clow-inflation regimes, in contrast to high-inflation ones, have self-stabilizing properties.\u201d\n\nRethinking Quantitative Easing\n\nWith a more flexible approach to those 2% targets, monetary policy after the 2008 financial crisis would have looked very different in many parts of the world. Trillions of dollars, euros, yen and pounds of asset purchases did little to raise prices in the face of global disinflationary forces until governments used the money they raised to stuff cash into consumers\u2019 pockets during Covid lockdowns.\n\nBut that\u2019s also been blamed for distorting financial markets. Episodes such as the Silicon Valley Bank blow-up are seen by some as a direct result of central bank reserves creation under QE, along with regulatory and supervision failures.\n\nOnly 40% of economists surveyed predict central banks will use QE the same way as they did before. A quarter expect them to deploy it more sparingly, about 30% see its only role going forward as a tool to address financial-stability concerns and a small minority doesn\u2019t see it being used again at all.\n\nThere are other problems with bond-buying that may affect how it\u2019s used in the future. QE effectively swaps long-term borrowing costs for short-term ones. What\u2019s been a lucrative deal for taxpayers when official interest rates were low has now turned into a disastrous trade.\n\nThe clearest depiction of the problem is in the UK, where the BOE secured taxpayer indemnity for any losses on QE. Over the next decade, it estimates, its purchases will cost the government over \u00a3200 billion ($243 billion).\n\nAnd policymakers have little experience in unwinding their balance sheets, where small mistakes can trigger big market turbulence.\n\nThe Fed experienced some of that when it tried to shrink bond holdings between 2017 and 2019. More recent efforts to reduce portfolios have progressed rather smoothly, partially because central banks have amassed so much debt over the years that they\u2019re far away from any thresholds that would trigger a squeeze.\n\nBut the fact that they\u2019re treating quantitative tightening as a technical adjustment rather than a part of their efforts to conquer inflation raises questions about the future use of a tool that\u2019s only trusted to work one way.\n\nThe ECB faces an extra legal burden on bond holdings that comes with operating in a currency union of 20 countries. Concerns around illegally financing governments and debt mutualization have already landed the central bank in court several times.\n\nMixing Policies\n\nLow interest rates and large-scale QE programs allowed treasuries to borrow on the cheap to finance stimulus campaigns, protecting labor markets, businesses and consumers from collapse. But the spending blowout throughout and since the pandemic \u2014 part critical emergency funding, part political need to show an all-hands-on-deck approach in crisis \u2014 contributed to the latest outbreak in inflation.\n\nWhile the same kind of pulling in the same direction is needed to restrain demand, many governments are concerned that if they tighten policy too hard, voters will kick them out and replace them with populists or extremists. That\u2019s reviving questions about whether central banks can deliver price stability all on their own.\n\n\u201cIf we were designing optimal policy arrangements from scratch, monetary and fiscal policy would both have a role in managing the economic cycle and inflation, and that there would be close coordination,\u201d Philip Lowe said in his last speech as Australian central bank governor in September.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg predict fiscal policy will somewhat counteract the Fed\u2019s efforts to rein in inflation in the US.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that there are circumstances where working hand in hand and supporting each other has proved helpful,\u201d ECB President Christine Lagarde told a panel discussion in June at the institution\u2019s annual economic forum.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, who sat to her right, signaled he wasn\u2019t ready to rely on that kind of cooperation. \u201cOur assignment is to deliver price stability kind of regardless of the stance of fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nCentral bankers warn that any failure to scale back fiscal spending risks coming at the cost of yet higher interest rates. They also want elected officials to put in place policies that help deliver sustainable growth.\n\n\u201cA change in mindset needs to happen,\u201d said Agustin Carstens, the former governor of the Bank of Mexico who\u2019s now the general manager of the BIS. \u201cGrowth needs to depend less on fiscal and monetary policy, it should depend more on structural policies.\u201d"

    "body": "For the past two weeks, coaches across college football have been riveted by the alleged Michigan sign-stealing scheme, but inside the Big Ten, the topic has been more than just a curiosity. On Wednesday\u2019s Big Ten coaches video call with commissioner Tony Petitti, and after Jim Harbaugh left the call, that frustration was voiced loud and clear, according to conference coaches, who said they don\u2019t feel like the new Big Ten commissioner is \u201cmotivated\u201d to do anything about the Wolverines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is just a ton of frustration,\u201d a Big Ten coach told The Athletic on Thursday morning. \u201cLook at Jim Harbaugh\u2019s record before this started. The guy was on the hot seat before 2021, and now he\u2019s like the king of college football. \u2026 No doubt this all has had a profound effect.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s being investigated for three different things now between the (alleged) illegal signal stealing, the (alleged) illegal recruiting during COVID and that investigation into the offensive coordinator and alleged computer hacking. There are guys (on that call) who could lose jobs, and then there\u2019s this guy over here (Harbaugh) who is gonna get a new, bigger contract now, and they won\u2019t do anything about him.\u201d\n\nAsked to describe the tone of the coaches\u2019 sentiment expressed to Petitti, another Big Ten coach called it \u201cangry\u201d \u2014 particularly at the Big Ten\u2019s lack of action, or even apparent interest in taking any.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s upset,\u201d that coach told The Athletic. \u201cWhy is nothing being done? We want to know, what else do you need to know to take action? We (the Big Ten head coaches) want something done now. I don\u2019t think people understand the advantage that what they\u2019re (allegedly) doing gives you. People think, \u2018OK, now that everybody knows, we all can just move on.\u2019 Like, \u2018now, it\u2019s fair.\u2019 Well, no, it isn\u2019t. Not at all. This changes the way you operate. A lot of teams have been doing things a certain way for years. Now, it\u2019s forcing you to teach your players a whole new way to communicate just for them. People think that this is just advanced scouting. This was damn near espionage.\u201d\n\nA third Big Ten head coach told The Athletic that this is \u201cone of the most egregious breaches in the spirit of the game\u201d he\u2019s ever heard of.\n\n\u201cThey (Michigan) have been manipulating the game and cheating the game for two-and-a-half years. To know exactly what the other team is doing, Michigan might as well have been playing with 15 guys on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the message the Big Ten is sending now by doing nothing? Win now, pay later? We might as well just send people to (scout) their practices and their games. It doesn\u2019t encourage anybody to follow the rules. It\u2019s just telling them to do the opposite and say, f\u2014 it.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Michigan should be punished, say 94% of CFB coaches in our poll. What else did it reveal?\n\nThe NCAA is investigating Michigan\u2019s football program amid allegations that the Wolverines used illegal in-person scouting and the recording of signals to steal signs this season. Ahead of the Michigan-Michigan State game on Oct. 21, the Big Ten approached MSU and said it was made aware of \u201ccredible evidence\u201d regarding the sign-stealing allegations. The Big Ten said it would monitor the NCAA\u2019s investigation into Michigan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten is so much more powerful than the NCAA,\u201d that third Big Ten coach said. \u201cWhy are you just sitting back and doing nothing about this? The Big Ten can\u2019t pound its chest for the last 30 years about how it does the right thing ethically (when other conferences like the SEC won\u2019t) and then have this go on. If this were a team in the bottom half of the Big Ten, would this be handled in the same way?\n\n\u201cWhen a running back gets hurt against Michigan because they knew exactly what play was coming, will that kid and his family have the ability to sue the Big Ten?\u201d\n\nThe NCAA investigation is ongoing, a process that typically moves slowly, which makes it difficult to imagine it will reach a resolution by the time the postseason begins. The Big Ten does have the ability to act under its sportsmanship policy, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it would want to act quickly or decisively before the NCAA completes its entire investigation and allows Michigan a chance to respond to its findings.\n\nThis is an unprecedented situation; whatever Petitti decides to do (or not do) will set a precedent. The Big Ten itself doesn\u2019t have investigators, so it needs to rely upon the NCAA to do that part \u2014 and to determine who else was involved in the alleged scouting scheme. It\u2019s not clear exactly what the coaches would want the league to do to punish Michigan; banning the team from competing in the Big Ten championship, for example, would harm players who had nothing to do with the sign-stealing apparatus.\n\nA source briefed on the coaches\u2019 call said Big Ten coaches are concerned about whether Michigan \u201cshould represent the Big Ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens, if Michigan continues to move forward, the clouds will follow,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey\u2019re reading the tea leaves and wondering why the Big Ten hasn\u2019t done anything yet. Every week and every day that goes by, people are like, \u2018Something\u2019s gotta give.\u2019 It\u2019s getting a little bit out of hand when you see him (allegedly) on the Central Michigan sideline. The playing field is not level right now. How can you have a team that you know has a competitive advantage over you still being allowed to play? That\u2019s what the coaches are grappling with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt feels like (former commissioner) Kevin (Warren) taking over and then COVID,\u201d the source continued. \u201cTony\u2019s walking into this situation, and people are calling for the league to make a statement before they have all the facts.\u201d\n\nDespite frustration from all corners of the conference, sources at four different Big Ten schools said they do not expect the conference to levy any sort of punishment against Michigan before the season ends.\n\nEarlier this week, Central Michigan said it is investigating whether suspended Michigan staffer Connor Stalions was on the CMU sideline during the Chippewas\u2019 Sept. 1 game at Michigan State. Screenshots of a person who looks similar to Stalions began circulating online Monday night, and The Athletic obtained more photos of the person on the sideline Tuesday.\n\nCentral Michigan is investigating if the person on the right here is Connor Stalions on the CMU sideline at Michigan State earlier this season. AD Amy Folan: \u201cWe became aware of these photos late yesterday and we are in the process of determining the facts surrounding them.\" pic.twitter.com/ncazAghBbS \u2014 Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) October 31, 2023\n\nStalions, who was suspended with pay by Michigan on Oct. 20, is at the center of the NCAA\u2019s investigation into the alleged scouting and sign-stealing scheme. Stalions bought tickets to games in at least seven Big Ten stadiums before those teams played the Wolverines over the past three seasons, including the 2023 season, sources told The Athletic last month. Purchasing the tickets is not a violation of NCAA rules, but using them to scout and record other teams would violate the rules, prohibiting in-person, on-campus scouting and the audio or video recording of signals.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t allegations. It happened,\u201d Purdue coach Ryan Walters said Thursday night on his radio show ahead of Saturday\u2019s game against the Wolverines. \u201cThere\u2019s video evidence. There\u2019s ticket purchases and sales you can track back. We know for a fact they were at a number of our games. We\u2019ve had to teach our guys a new language.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, coach Jim Harbaugh met with reporters and said \u201cthe people that know us the most think the most of us\u201d as Michigan faces the NCAA investigation. He has denied knowledge of the alleged scouting.\n\nGO DEEPER Ten thoughts on the Big Ten's 2024 schedule\n\nRequired reading\n\n(Photo: David Berding / Getty Images)"

    "body": "Discord is introducing new safeguards to protect young users. On Thursday, the company announced Teen Safety Assist. The rollout will happen in the coming weeks and consists of two features: Automated alerts and content filters.\n\nMoving forward, when a user a teen hasn\u2019t chatted with before sends a direct message, Discord will display a safety alert if the platform\u2019s automated systems suspect the teen\u2019s safety could be at risk. The prompt will nudge the young person to reconsider if they want to respond to the message, and point them to the app\u2019s block feature and related safety tips.\n\nBy default, Discord will now also automatically blur potentially sensitive images from a teen\u2019s friends. Young people can disable the feature through an option in Discord\u2019s settings menu. Adults, meanwhile, can enable the filters for themselves, if they want the additional protections.\n\nThe introduction of Teen Safety Assist comes amid increased scrutiny of Discord\u2019s efforts to limit the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and protect young users from predatory adults. In June, NBC News identified 35 cases over a period of six years where adults had allegedly used the platform to kidnap, groom or sexually assault minors. The outlet also found 165 cases where authorities were prosecuting adults for sharing CSAM over Discord or allegedly using the platform to extort young users into sending sexual images of themselves.\n\nIn the aftermath of the report, Discord banned teen dating servers and changed its safety policies to ban the sharing of AI-generated CSAM. It also announced new rules explicitly prohibiting any other kind of text or media content that sexualizes children. At the same time, the company introduced Family Center, a dashboard for parents and guardians to keep track of what their teens are doing on Discord.\n\nDiscord\n\n\u201cTeens are still in the process of learning about themselves and what it means to be online, and our new safety features are rooted in providing them with agency on the platform, to give them ways to learn and grow in safe and age-appropriate online spaces,\u201d said Savannah Badalich, senior director of policy at Discord. \u201cThese newest features are part of an ongoing, multi-year effort to continually evolve and advance safety on Discord.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Discord is introducing a new warning system for people who violate its policies. Outside of incidents involving the most \u201cextreme\u201d violations, the company is moving away from permanent bans. It\u2019s doing so under the belief that most users will choose to be better online citizens given the chance and proper guidance.\n\nIn practice, the system will notify a person when they\u2019ve violated one or more of Discord\u2019s policies and detail the restrictions on their account. It will also link out to the company\u2019s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines and appeal mechanism. A new \u201cAccount Standing\u201d tab within the settings menu will allow users to see all their current and past policy violations.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve built the most nuanced and proportionate reporting system,\u201d Badalich told Engadget, adding the company hopes other platforms will look to what Discord has created for inspiration related to their own enforcement efforts. \u201cWe believe people, especially teens, have the capacity to grow.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Discord announced a slew of new features and enhancements slated to arrive either in the near future or down the line. To start, the platform\u2019s in-app shop, which Discord began testing last month with Nitro subscribers, will soon be available to all users. The marketplace features digital items people can use to decorate their avatars and profiles. Discord will offer store discounts to Nitro members, as part of a new perk for signing up.\n\nDiscord\n\nThis week, the company will also start a broad roll-out of a feature called Remix. It allows users to edit an image directly within Discord\u2019s mobile app and share it with their friends and servers. The company spent much of the last year improving its Android and iOS clients. One recent update saw it improve app launch times on both platforms. In the near future, Discord says people can expect a new \u201cMidnight\u201d dark mode the company claims reduces battery consumption on devices with OLED screens, more functional notification tabs and a new search feature for the settings menu to make it easier to find the exact option you\u2019re looking to tweak.\n\nLast but not least, the company says it will begin rolling out Premium App Subscriptions to eligible developers in the UK and Europe, following a launch that began in the US a few weeks ago. On the subject of third-party apps, bots and plugins, the company said it\u2019s in the process of exploring how to make those accessible across nearly every part of Discord. It provided few details on the effort, but said the goal is to allow people to access their favorite apps and bots without those experiences being restricted to select servers.\n\n\u201cWe're experimenting with a few different things, but the goal is for developers to reach more people with the awesome experience they're building. For users, we don\u2019t want them to be gated from having these custom experiences at their fingertips,\u201d Cherry Park, director of product marketing at Discord, told Engadget. \u201cIn terms of the way we architecture and build it, there are a couple of solutions. Some are easier, some are more difficult, and you're going to see us experiment with a few of them over the next few quarters.\u201d\n\nDiscord promised to share more about its efforts around app portability in the near future. In the meantime, Nitro subscribers will get a chance to test new features before they become available to the public.\n\nUpdate, October 20, 2023, 11:20 AM ET: This story has been updated to note that these feature are rolling out in the coming weeks, not this week as the post originally said. We also removed a mention that Discord would automatically delete potentially sensitive content from strangers. This was originally part of a briefing we received on the new features, but it was not included in the final release."

    "body": "His company is accused of falsifying the records that come with aviation components to show they are the real deal. CFM, a joint venture between GE and Safran that manufactures engines, is now pursuing a legal case against AOG in Britain\u2019s High Court. Zamora is defending the case. Verification documents are important because of the exacting specifications of airline parts. Engine modules must tolerate temperatures that would melt many materials and even basic parts must be certified. Because of these demands, even a bolt can cost thousands of dollars if it is holding an engine in place. As a result, the market for airline parts is a very lucrative one. Since 2015, Zamora has charmed his way deep into the complex network of companies and decision makers who move billions of dollars worth of airline parts around the world.\n\nBusiness associates who worked with him outside AOG and who were willing to speak to The Telegraph describe a savvy operator who was fun to be around. Loading Zamora, who is Venezuelan, got his start in aviation in 2010 as an account manager at AJW, an engine maintenance business, according to Bloomberg. A keen techno DJ, he was also gigging as recently as 2018 according to the Daily Mail. Zamora founded AOG in 2015 from a rented terraced house in Hove, about 70 kilometres south of London on the UK\u2019s South Coast.\n\nIt appeared to be small scale in its early years: the company\u2019s registered address moved between four homes in the following three years, shifting from Hove to London in 2017. Then, the company was registered at serviced offices in central London. Friends say they haven\u2019t been in contact with Zamora in a number of months as he begins his defence in London\u2019s High Court. AOG\u2019s website appears offline, but a cached version says the company offered \u201ca diverse portfolio of quality products and services\u201d. \u201cWith our head office in the UK and warehouse operations in London, Frankfurt, Miami and Singapore, we are uniquely positioned to support our customers around the world \u2013 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,\u201d the website read. \u201cWe keep our clients flying.\u201d The company\u2019s phone line is still connected but offers only endless hold music.\n\nAOG is understood to have sold mainly smaller parts for jet engines, such as bolts, nuts, washers, dampers and seals. The parts don\u2019t carry a serial number and are therefore harder to trace. Worryingly, some bigger parts appear to be linked to the scandal. Some turbine blades have also been identified by CFM as suspect. CFM is understood to believe that AOG had been passing off old parts for new ones. Steve Borrowdale, managing director at Multiflight, a Leeds-based engineer and parts supplier, says sneaking parts into a jet engine is difficult. After vetting a seller for experience and approval certification, a buyer would also carefully inspect a part from a new supplier.\n\n\u201cYou get the box, you\u2019d have a look, just for simple things. If there\u2019s a brand-new part coming in a non-identified box, you might start to question it.\u201d Choosing parts without serial numbers could make falsifying documents easier, he said, but it would still take great skill. The supply of parts in aviation is through a dazzling patchwork of thousands of often small manufacturers, brokers and distributors. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just take a novice off the street and start selling these things, you would have to have gotten some training somewhere along the way.\u201d According to filings at Companies House, AOG grew slowly from 2015 until 2019, when the company had net assets of \u00a322,000 ($42,000).\n\nBy early 2020, it was worth \u00a32.2 million. A breakthrough came when it won a deal with logistics firm B&H Worldwide to distribute parts from its hub in Frankfurt. \u201cThe two companies have previously worked together for exports to Europe and the US from the UK, but this is the first time they have partnered in mainland Europe,\u201d the pair said in a press release in 2020. AOG\u2019s cash bonanza came before the COVID-19 lockdowns of that year, according to the filings. The pandemic grounded flights and was a disaster for the aviation industry. However, the end of lockdowns triggered a resurgence in international travel and a rush to secure jets and parts amid backlogs in factories. The parts scramble that followed would be a perfect breeding ground for an unscrupulous seller, said Borrowdale.\n\n\u201cSince COVID, raw materials are increasingly difficult to get hold of,\u201d he said. The supply of parts in aviation is through a dazzling patchwork of thousands of often small manufacturers, brokers and distributors. Manufacturers and operators are heavily regulated and largely responsible for orchestrating the paper trail that follows every aviation part, from computers and fuselage panels to screw housings and washers. CFM has had to audit more than 500 suppliers to try and find out what items could be caught up in the crisis. The parts so far identified in the forgery scandal are not thought to include the most sensitive components, known as life-limited parts, which operate under the most stress in a jet engine and are carefully monitored by manufacturers while operating on the plane. However, even dodgy fastenings have claimed lives.\n\nPartnair Flight 394 crashed off the coast of Denmark in September 1989, killing all 55 passengers and crew, after its tail fin came off. Three of the four bolts holding the fin in place were counterfeit and weaker than those designed for the plane. The weak bolts and other maintenance problems allowed vibrations that caused the rudder to fail and break off, investigators later found. Loading Following that incident and other bogus parts scandals, Mary Schiavo, who was inspector general at the US Department of Transportation in the early 1990s, ran a campaign against the sale of unapproved aircraft parts and helped secure more than a hundred criminal convictions. She uncovered bogus components that had been made by manufacturers that had lost their certification to make the parts, old equipment passed off as new, re-labelled defective parts and outright fakes that were never designed for aviation use. These are largely the categories into which bad parts still fall, she says. Unapproved parts were even found in part of a fire control system on Air Force One in 1995, she said.\n\n\u201cLiterally, if it\u2019s on an aeroplane, it could be fake.\u201d Following her investigation, various reforms came in, including a warning system to flag suspicious components. \u201cI\u2019ve had cases where counterfeit parts have caused deaths. What\u2019s at stake is the safety of the lives of the flying public.\u201d While plane and engine manufacturers, pilots and aviation companies are heavily regulated, distributors are not, she warns. She pushed for tighter rules in the 1990s but was ignored. The High Court case against AOG began on September 21 and is ongoing.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority has said it is supporting the US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency in investigating the matter. A spokesman for CFM said: \u201cWe are working collaboratively with operators, so they can promptly remove the unauthorised parts from their engines in accordance with the recommendations issued by the regulatory agencies. \u201cWe remain united with the aviation community in working to keep unapproved parts out of the global supply chain.\u201d B&H was approached for comment. Zamora was approached for comment through friends and his barrister. The Telegraph, UK"

    "body": "Instagram Threads isn\u2019t the only app joining the decentralized social web, which includes Twitter/X rival Mastodon and other apps, with its newly added support for the networking protocol ActivityPub. Today, the social magazine app Flipboard is announcing it has also now integrated with ActityPub. In its initial phase, select Flipboard accounts will be discoverable and can be followed by the millions of users of decentralized social apps, including Mastodon. Over time, all profiles on Flipboard will be available in the fediverse, as this network of decentralized social apps is known.\n\nThe company announced its intention earlier this year to participate in the fediverse. It began by integrating its app with Mastodon via an API and setting up its own Mastodon server, flipboard.social, ahead of full ActivityPub integration. This allowed Flipboard to get a feel for the world of decentralized social media, and learn how its users would respond. It also gave Flipboard a way to stay connected to social media after Twitter/X increased its API fees for third-party developers, making it unsustainable for many developers to continue to work with the company.\n\nThe Flipboard app\u2019s primary purpose has been to curate into social \u201cmagazines\u201d news and information found on the web, including links to articles, photos and other social posts. As a result, it had relied on Twitter as one of its sources of information. That changed this year, when Flipboard shifted its Twitter integration over to Mastodon and another alternative social app, Bluesky. It also set up its own Mastodon server and began curating news across the fediverse via editorial \u201cdesks\u201d focused on improving the discovery of news on Mastodon.\n\nAll this was in the lead-up to making Flipboard itself a federated social app, a process that\u2019s kicking off today.\n\nInitially, Flipboard is testing the integration with select accounts, including publishers like Semafor, Pitchfork, Fast Company, Medium, LGBTQ Nation, Refinery 29, Digiday, Polygon, SPIN, Kotaku, Frommer\u2019s, The Verge, Smithsonian Magazine, Refinery 29, The Root, ScienceAlert, AFAR Media and others. While many are focused on news, there are also some nonprofits like The News Literacy Project and education-focused news site The 74, in this debut list.\n\n\u201cAs we said in the earlier part of this year, we will be embracing ActivityPub into Flipboard and effectively reworking our whole backend to that,\u201d explained Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, in a conversation with TechCrunch about the coming changes. He says the company had first integrated with Mastodon at the API level, so users could log into their Mastodon accounts, see those posts and interact with others in the fediverse from Flipboard. \u201cBut you had to have an account on all those platforms,\u201d McCue noted.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re announcing on Monday is basically our roadmap for how we will be rolling out ActivityPub, and effectively tearing down the walls around our own walled garden,\u201d he added.\n\nWith the changes, when Flipboard users curate an article or post into one of their social magazines on Flipboard\u2019s app, with an optional comment, that \u201cflip,\u201d as it\u2019s called, will also appear as a post on their new flipboard.com Mastodon account. This is not the same server as Flipboard had set up before (flipboard.social), which was a place to experiment with decentralized social media. Instead, it\u2019s the Flipboard app itself that\u2019s now connected to the fediverse. Users\u2019 posts on Mastodon will include a link both to the article being flipped and to the user\u2019s Flipboard magazine, while the user profile will point to their Flipboard profile page.\n\nAs this rolls out, all Flipboard users will have one Flipboard.com account connected to the fediverse, even if they host numerous Flipboard magazines. That\u2019s not ideal as their magazines may focus on different topics. But McCue believes that Mastodon could one day support a notion of sub-feeds that would allow more differentiation.\n\nUsers will be able to opt out of having their \u201cflips\u201d posted on Mastodon, but being opted-in will be the default experience. The company expects to have all its user accounts connected to the fediverse by the end of January. (This won\u2019t impact any magazines set to \u201cprivate\u201d on Flipboard. Those will remain private, McCue notes.)\n\nToday, Flipboard has over 10,000 publishers of social magazines on its app and over a quarter million individuals who are curating content using Flipboard\u2019s app. Given that Mastodon today has around 1.5 million monthly active users, this could be a notable bump for the fediverse when Flipboard\u2019s integration fully rolls out, assuming Flipboard\u2019s users don\u2019t opt out.\n\nFlipboard is only one of now several companies that has embraced decentralized social media. In addition to X rival Instagram Threads, which began testing ActivityPub last week, other tech companies are moving in this direction, as well. Automattic made it possible for all WordPress.org and WordPress.com blogs to become federated, and said it\u2019s working on doing the same with Tumblr next year. Medium and Mozilla have also set up their own servers, and the latter backed a Mastodon client called Mammoth, too.\n\nFor Flipboard, after integrating its back end with the fediverse, the company may reconsider what its front end should look like, too, for this new age of social media.\n\n\u201cThe front end was built at a time pre-federation,\u201d noted McCue. \u201cWhat are the implications of federation in the front end? How do we think about curation and all the things, all the capabilities and tools that we\u2019ve created over the years? How does that work in a world that\u2019s federated, and from a user experience point of view? That is a great question,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite all the changes, Flipboard is not in need of raising funds to support its new developments. It\u2019s running off the profits of its own business as it moves in this direction.\n\nThe company is also betting on the fact that federated social media may only be the beginning of what\u2019s to come for the web overall.\n\n\u201cI saw what was happening with ActivityPub and it became very clear to me that this is the future of the web, period,\u201d McCue said. \u201cThe social web is people linking to pages and people linking to people. So it\u2019s a much more intricate web.\u201d\n\nHe sees Flipboard as a part of that opportunity. \u201cThere needs to be a way to do discovery and search and have it be beautiful and simple and easy to use. That is what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d McCue added."

TV deals Laptop deals Headphone/earbud deals Tablet deals Smartwatch deals Gaming deals Speaker and soundbar deals Vacuum deals Robot vacuum deals Home and kitchen deals Outdoor deals Apple deals Pet deals Fitness deals Toys and gift deals\n\nUPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 4:00 a.m. EST We've updated this story with the latest deals from the Walmart early Cyber Monday sale.\n\nEarly birds already know that Walmart launched its first round of Black Friday deals back on Nov. 8 and just dished out another round the day before Thanksgiving. Some of the retailer's most popular rollbacks have already sold out. Leave items in your shopping cart too long and you'll risk losing out on your haul.\n\nAlthough the official Black Friday programming has kept us busy all month long, the big day has finally arrived \u2014 actual Black Friday. If you've held out until now to do your shopping, we've compiled a list of over 180 of the best deals from Walmart's Black Friday sale and highlighted our favorites from different departments. We'll be updating the list throughout Cyber Monday, so keep checking back.\n\nWhat are Walmart's Black Friday hours in 2023?\n\nThe days of lining up outside big-box stores on Black Friday eve have officially ended, and we're not sorry. Not only is this kinder on Walmart employees, but it puts the kibosh on the kinds of doorbuster melees that often took place in the past. (They were a national embarrassment.)\n\nFor 2023, Walmart launched its Black Friday deals online first, with the last round of rollbacks going live Wednesday, Nov. 22 at 3 p.m. ET. In-person shoppers had to wait until Friday, Nov. 24 at 6 a.m. when Walmart stores officially opened their doors, although hours can differ depending on the location. Shoppers will have until 11 p.m. to finish their Black Friday shopping.\n\nOf course, there's no need to brave the crowds. You can still find the best Walmart Black Friday sales online, and we've got a lot of them for you below.\n\nIs Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale?\n\nGlad you asked. If you don't have time to shop the Black Friday sales or you missed out on a great deal earlier this month, don't you worry. Walmart just announced its official Cyber Monday sale will start on Sunday, Nov. 26 at 7 p.m. ET, exclusively on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. If you're a Walmart+, you can access the sale three hours in advance, starting at 4 p.m. ET. This is the first time Walmart has given early access to Walmart+ members for its Cyber Monday sale (although it usually does for Black Friday). The Cyber Monday sale promises deals on top gifts with savings of up to 80% on apparel, beauty, tech, toys, and more. Stay tuned for the best deals from the sale in the coming days.\n\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\n\nTV deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe best Walmart Black Friday deals typically include giant rollbacks on TVs, and that tradition continues in 2023. Unfortunately, many popular 4K TVs sold out way before Black Friday officially began, but there are still solid cheap 4K TVs lingering. This 55-inch QLED TV was already affordable at full price and is now seeing an extra $50 discount, pushing it below $350. Thanks to its extra layer of quantum dots, you'll be able to appreciate rich colors and deep blacks even during the day.\n\nMore TV deals\n\n43 to 55 inches\n\n65 inches\n\n70 to 86 inches\n\nLaptop deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe total discount on this HP laptop isn't the biggest rollback we've seen so far, but it's a deceptively good deal on an underpriced laptop. With an Intel Core i5 processor, this business 2-in-1 will be more than capable of handling your day-to-day work (and after-work streaming and surfing). While supplies last, you can get this device for under $500.\n\nMore laptop deals\n\nTraditional laptops\n\n2-in-1 laptops\n\nGaming laptops\n\nHeadphone/earbud deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nIf you're not ready to make the switch over to USB-C just yet, the second-gen AirPods Pro with a Lightning port are a stellar buy at only $169 \u2014 it's their lowest price to date. (For its part, Amazon has never put them on sale for less than $189.) These wireless earbuds from fall 2022 \"sound wonderful and have almost uncanny active noise cancelation,\" said Mashable senior editor Stan Schroeder, and they last for up to six hours on a single charge.\n\nRead Mashable's review of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation).\n\nMore headphone/earbud deals\n\nTablet deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nBest tablets under $100? Try best tablets under $30. Sure, this onn. tablet may not have all the functionality of an iPad, but if you're looking for a super basic tablet to watch videos or read on, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything in the $20 range. Even Fire tablets have only dropped down to $40 this Cyber Monday.\n\nMore tablet deals\n\nSmartwatch deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nApple's latest entry-level wearable also has a new record-low price at Walmart for Black Friday (which works out to a 28% savings). It's lighter and 20 percent faster than the original Apple Watch SE from 2020, and it features most of the same health tools as the new flagship Apple Watch Series 9 \u2014 that includes heart rate notifications, Emergency SOS, Cycle Tracking, and Fall and Crash Detection. It also offers a comparable 18-hour battery life and water resistance.\n\nMore smartwatch deals\n\nGaming deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nWith $439 as the new all-time low price for this Xbox bundle, you're basically getting a free copy of Diablo IV on top of a $60 discount on the Series X (which typically sells for $499.99 on its own). The only other retailer that was matching it at the time of writing was the Microsoft Store itself, and its markdown seems to have popped up recently in response to Walmart's doorbuster: A post on the Xbox Wire had previously pegged its Black Friday price there at $509.99.\n\nRead Mashable's review of the Xbox Series X.\n\nMore gaming deals\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nPlayStation\n\nXbox\n\nPC gaming\n\nVR gaming\n\nMeta Quest 2 (128GB) \u2014 $249 $299.99 (save $50.99) + free $50 Meta Quest Store credit\n\nOther gaming deals\n\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe older version of our favorite portable Bluetooth speaker is decently loud for its compact size, IPX7-rated for waterproofing, and capable of charging other devices via USB (hence its name) \u2014 it's ideal for traveling. It usually retails for $179.95 on the JBL website, meaning Walmart's $89 Black Friday price is an even better deal than advertised.\n\nMore speaker and soundbar deals\n\nVacuum deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nDyson's V15 Detect is a cordless stick vacuum with a fancy LCD screen and a bright built-in laser that illuminates tiny crumbs, pet hairs, and dust particles on your floors (so you can be sure you're actually cleaning them thoroughly); the premium Absolute variant has a shiny gold finish, HEPA filtration, and an extra dusting/crevice tool. Walmart's Black Friday deal saves you 27% and makes it $100 cheaper than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which has a smaller dust bin and less suction power.\n\nRead Mashable's review of the Dyson V15 Detect (non-Absolute).\n\nMore vacuum deals\n\nCordless vacuums\n\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

It maps your home and vacuums and mops the rooms you want it to, offering a more thorough cleaning with Matrix mode. During dry vacuuming, it cleans in a crosshatch pattern to grab any debris missed from the first pass, and during mopping, it scrubs the floor from multiple angles to eat away at stubborn stains.\n\nMore robot vacuum deals\n\nHome and kitchen deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nVitamix's professional-quality blenders are great to buy refurbished: You'll save a ton of money while preventing an otherwise serviceable device from going to a landfill. This powerful, 64-ounce Explorian model has three program settings (for Smoothies, Hot Soup, and Frozen Desserts) and a low-profile container that lets it fit under most kitchen countertops. It's been cleaned and tested to work as good as new, save for a few hard-to-see \"micro-scratches,\" and comes with a one-year warranty.\n\nMore home and kitchen deals\n\nSmall appliances\n\nAir purifiers\n\nCookware\n\nOutdoor deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nFeaturing a removable ashtray and a lightweight stainless steel design (plus its own carrying case), the Solo Stove Ranger 2.0 is a smaller version of our favorite smokeless fire pit \u2014 and yes, it really is virtually smokeless. This bundle throws in a stand that allows it to safely burn on decks or green grass, and it actually retails for $264.99 on the brand's website; Walmart's list price is slightly deflated, so it's an even better deal than it appears to be.\n\nRead Mashable's review of the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0.\n\nMore outdoor deals\n\nApple deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 is \"a robust and elite wearable device \u2013 the best Apple has ever made,\" according to Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder. While it looks almost identical to its predecessor, it's equipped with a new s9 chip, which makes it about 30 percent snappier than before. It also boasts double the storage and has double the peak brightness and a fun new Double Tap feature. It's not an essential upgrade if you already have a Series 7 or 8, but it's certainly a step in the right direction for those with older watches. At $359 for the 45mm GPS version, it's currently sitting at an all-time low cost at Walmart.\n\nMore Apple deals\n\nPet deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nA solid dog tracking device for pet parents on a budget, Tractive gives you the ability to track your dog's live location within the companion app. It also allows you to set up a virtual fence and notifies you when your pet steps out of (or enters) the safe area. It's not perfect \u2014 the battery is just so-so and the live tracking can be a bit glitchy \u2014 but for the price, it's hard to beat. Save $20 for Black Friday at Walmart and snag it for only $29.99.\n\nMore pet deals\n\nFitness deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe Walmart-exclusive Echelon Connect Sport is a solid Peloton alternative for a retail price that won't make you cringe. And for Black Friday, it's on sale for over $400 off, knocking the price down to a super impressive $297. But just because it's wallet-friendly doesn't mean its specs don't impress. The Connect Sport features 32 levels of silent magnetic resistance, aero handlebars and adjustable pedals, and Bluetooth technology that lets you connect any smart device to the Echelon Fit app. Speaking of which, the app gives you access to 40+ daily live and 15,000+ on-demand connected fitness classes. The $297 Black Friday cost even includes a 30-day free trial of Echelon Premier membership to get you started.\n\nMore fitness deals\n\nToys and gift deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nIn days gone by, Walmart's Black Friday sale was full of 40% or higher discounts, but the era of the doorbuster deal is ending. And that's why it's so refreshing to see a full 50% discount on a popular item like this. The LEGO Star Wars line includes tons of great gift ideas for fans of all ages, from Jedis to Padawans. This building kit of The Child, aka Baby Yoda, is just begging to live on your office desk.\n\nMore deals on toys and gifts"

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nTravis Kelce believes the National Football League\u2019s coverage of his rumoured girlfriend Taylor Swift is a bit too much.\n\nFollowing his game against the New York Jets on 1 October, the 33-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end opened up about the NFL broadcast on the most recent episode of his podcast, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. In conversation with his brother Jason, 35, the two addressed concerns from longtime football enthusiasts who were frustrated by the constant Swift references throughout Sunday\u2019s game at MetLife Stadium.\n\nNot only did the football league promote last Sunday\u2019s game by speculating whether the Grammy winner will attend the Chiefs-Jets match, but cameras were constantly panning to the star-studded suite. During the game, Swift was joined an A-list group of guests, including her best friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, and actor Hugh Jackman.\n\nThe NFL also introduced a special segment with Carson Daly and The Voice, where the famed host attempted to explain the specifics of football to \u201cSwifties.\u201d\n\nIn the New Heights podcase episode, titled \u201cThe NFL Needs to Calm Down\u201d, Jason asked his brother plainly whether he thought the football was \u201coverdoing it\u201d with the coverage of Swift during the game.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is just, like, overwhelmed,\u201d the Chiefs tight end replied.\n\n\u201cTake away your feelings for Taylor,\u201d Jason added. \u201cWhat is your honest opinion on how the NFL is treating celebrities at the games?\u201d\n\nSeemingly beating around the bush, Kelce remarked: \u201cI think it brings a little more to the atmosphere, it brings a little bit more to what you\u2019re watching. But at the same time, I think...\u201d\n\nBefore his younger brother could continue his thought, the Philadelphia Eagles player chimed in: \u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it a little bit, for sure,\u201d Kelce agreed. \u201cEspecially my situation. I think they\u2019re just trying to have fun with it.\u201d\n\nWhile sports lovers may not be too pleased with the NFL\u2019s focus on Swift, the football league\u2019s supposed obsession with ongoing Swift and Kelce dating rumours has paid off in terms of ratings. Per a Deadline report, NBC accumulated an average of 27m viewers, with a total of 29m tuning in during the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be an NFL record right there,\u201d Jason told his younger brother, as he noted that about two million viewers were estimated to be female. \u201cI think a few of them might have been there for Deadpool and, uh, Taylor.\u201d\n\nIn the YouTube comments under the New Heights video podcast, fellow fans shared their opinions on the NFL\u2019s coverage. \u201cI agree the NFL needs to calm down. Pissing off football fans is not how you repay your boi [sic] for all he\u2019s done for the sport,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother remarked: \u201cPity Taylor. All she ever wanted was to watch the football game. Now she\u2019s being blamed and hated left and right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NFL needs to seriously tone it down and let Trav and Tay explore this beautiful thing they have going on in peace,\u201d someone else said.\n\nElsewhere in the podcast, the brothers revealed the one person who was most delighted to see famous musicians, actors, and professional athletes all coming together for Sunday\u2019s game was none other than \u201cMama Kelce,\u201d aka Donna Kelce. On 1 October, the NFL players\u2019 mother travelled from Philadelphia to New Jersey to watch both her sons play football on the same day.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on top of the f***ing world, man,\u201d Kelce told his older brother. He also acknowledged how his mother seemed to be loving the new guests in her family suite, watching her son play along with her. \u201cI know mom enjoyed it,\u201d Kelce confessed.\n\n\u201cI shot her a text. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see her, so I shot her a text right after the game on the bus ride to the airport and was like: \u2018Hey, mom, sorry I didn\u2019t get to catch you before I left but I hope you enjoyed the game,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cI appreciate you always trying to make it to both of our games.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe also told me thank you because she was in an alternate universe, she was sitting there with Deadpooland Wolverine,\u201d Kelce added, referencing Reynolds\u2019 and Jackman\u2019s respective superhero movie characters. \u201cIt was a hot ticket, man, you know what I\u2019m saying? That suite was rockin\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey were enjoying themselves. Somebody told me that everybody was enjoying themselves in that suite,\u201d Kelce said.\n\nNot only has NFL viewership increased since Swift began attending her rumoured boyfriend\u2019s games, but jersey sales for the Chiefs tight end have reportedly spiked by 400 per cent, according to a report from the NFL\u2019s e-commerce partner, Fanatics.\n\nFollowing critcism the league is focusing too much on Swift, the NFL responded with an official statement handed to People on 4 October.\n\n\u201cWe frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what\u2019s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,\u201d the message read. \u201cThe Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we\u2019ve leaned into in real time, as it\u2019s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we\u2019ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our content has remained focused on the game, our players and variety of other initiatives, including our Toy Story Funday Football alt-cast, the international games and more,\u201d they continued."

    "body": "Breathtaking is fair. Like the ABBA Voyage show in London, it is hard to capture in words. In many ways, it\u2019s a conventional space: there is tiered seating inside, and wallet-bruising bar snacks and merchandise for sale outside. Some parts of the rock concert experience will never change. But when the lights go down, everything changes. Around you, Sphere splits open to reveal a succession of environments, each more stunning than the one before. Though the structure is familiar - the audience seated in rows, the band on a single, central stage - the effect is overwhelming. In U2\u2019s show, we journey through a succession of environments referencing the band\u2019s creative history. For other projects, such as Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Postcard From Earth, the Sphere\u2019s sound system uses \u201chaptics\u201d to make the audience feel the sounds. U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects These are the technical specs: an interior 16K x 16K spherical video surface, the highest-resolution LED screen ever made with 268,435,456 pixels, and an exterior covered by 1.2 million hockey-puck-sized LEDs. There are 157,000 ultra-directional speakers \u2013 the boffins call it \u201cbeam-forming acoustics\u201d \u2013 and there are \u201cinfrasound haptics\u201d, which means the soundwaves are shaped to create both vibrations and waves of air pressure.\n\nThe comparison to ABBA\u2019s show in London is perhaps the only approximate one: both are wholly enveloping experiences where the lights, sound and special effects are blended to push the audience\u2019s senses to the limit. They differ in one key way; ABBA pushes its effects out toward you, largely to play smoke and mirrors with the on-stage simulacrums. Sphere, in contrast, more wholly and subtly envelops you. \u201cThey are both legacy projects made by artists who have the career and track record to be able to look at these things objectively in a way that a younger performer perhaps wouldn\u2019t because it takes an entire lifetime of experience to make those kinds of choices and make it work,\u201d Williams says. The two shows also share British music stage architecture firm Stufish whose work ranges from the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee, tours for Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Elton John and Madonna as well as the ABBA Arena in London. Stufish partner Ric Lipson (along with artist Es Devlin and producer Brian Eno) collaborated on the U2 project for Sphere. \u201cWith the ABBA Arena, it\u2019s absolutely designed for that show, but you could also imagine that building having another avatar show in there, or indeed a live performance where people would use the technology that\u2019s in the building as an immersive environment,\u201d Lipson says.\n\n\u201cThe Sphere does a similar thing, [in that] you have a fully immersive space, the video screen in the Sphere is vast, it has a huge number of pixels, and you can immerse the audience within this environment.\u201d So what does all this mean for the concert industry, which has historically built its lucrative concert spin-off industry on the conversion of sports venues to rock concert stages? It certainly means the future is looking a little more ... spherical? And, from a technological perspective, a little more plug-and-play. \u201cIt opens you up to thinking about performances in different ways, both from a creative point of view, from a business point of view, from a sustainability point of view, and the ability to not have to bring your own structure and screen and [sound system],\u201d Lipson says. ABBA\u2019s simulacrums on stage at ABBA Arena in London. Credit: Johan Persson \u201cWe have Adele in Caesar\u2019s Palace right now, which again is another large show that immerses the audience, but we bring everything in and every time we load that show out, it takes a week or so,\u201d Lipson adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about the Sphere idea is that they are planning multiple spheres, and then you can think about shows being able to move from sphere to sphere.\n\n\u201cBoth [the U2 and ABBA] shows are taking a bold stab at the next-generation way of doing shows,\u201d Lipson says, but notes that the traditional blueprint of iconic artist and audience remains key. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a regular arena right now with Madonna, we are doing a very exciting show that pushes the limits of a pop show balancing staging and audience, and we are doing things that will feel fresh for her audience and for the show.\u201d Critically, says Lipson, the staging for the U2 show is elementary in real terms, despite its technological complexity. \u201cAnd what\u2019s interesting is that the Sphere, like ABBA Arena, is only touching the sides of what you can do,\u201d he says. \u201cIn five years\u2019 time and 10 years\u2019 time, two years\u2019 time, whenever the technology shifts, you\u2019ll be able to do more.\u201d By the numbers ... U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects The screens, for example, are a bespoke assembly of state-of-the-art screens. But behind those screens are \u201ca whole new kind of speaker,\u201d Lipson says. \u201cIn a regular show, the speakers are at one end pushing the sound down the room, so it\u2019s louder at the stage end and quieter further away. [But here] because everybody\u2019s sort of getting their own feed, everybody\u2019s getting an equal volume. So hearing the show in there, sonically, may be better than anywhere.\u201d When the Sphere venue is in cinema mode, it utilises the full range of haptics, that is its ability to shape sound into both vibrations that will literally shake your seat, but also waves of pressure that can be felt. To those, the haptic systems add both artificial wind and a range of scents, paired to key moments, such as scenes of rocket launches or wild storms. Scratch \u2019n sniff, anyone?\n\nAs far back as the 1950s, Hollywood used three synchronised 35mm projectors to send a single image into a huge, deeply curved screen and called it Cinerama. It clocked in at just 146-degrees, well short of the Sphere\u2019s 270-degree view. Another 1950s technology, Circle-Vision 360, essentially nine cameras positioned in an outward-facing circle, was used to create 360-degree film images, the most famous of which was Disneyland\u2019s America the Beautiful film. Drawing a little less fanfare than U2\u2019s debut on the Sphere stage was the premiere of Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Postcard From Earth, a 50-minute 18K resolution film shot to fit the 270-degree wraparound screen, using an 18K Big Sky camera, and featuring sequences shot in Greece, India, Mexico and the USA. The Big Sky, in layman\u2019s terms, delivers an image that is about 40 times greater in resolution than a 4K television screen. From Vegas to the desert ... U2 perform at the Sphere. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects Like Lipson, Williams is cautious about becoming lost in the dramatic differences of scale, particularly when it is the storytelling of the bands and their discographies that are the key draw for the audience. The same principles apply, Williams says, whether the show is U2 at Sphere or, in another of his shows, Australian playwright Suzie Miller\u2019s Prima Facie, starring Jodie Comer, on the substantially smaller stages of London\u2019s Harold Pinter Theatre and Broadway\u2019s John Golden Theatre.

I\u2019m here in the ring now and that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese dudes (promoters) put the people in front of me and I just knock them out.\u201d\n\nOpetaia\u2019s next fight could be on the Tyson Fury-Oleksandr Usyk card in Riyadh on February 17.\n\nPromoter Eddie Hearn said the Australian had the potential to replicate Usyk\u2019s career and unify the cruiserweight division before moving up to the heavyweights.\n\n\u201cEvery fight man knows,\u201d Hearn said of the man regarded as the No.1 cruiserweight in the world.\n\n\u201cI believe Jai\u2019s going to do the exact same thing (as Usyk) \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a pound-for-pound talent,\u201d Hearn said.\n\nDubbed the \u2018Day of Reckoning\u2019, the Middle East card features heavyweight stars Joshua, Wilder, Parker and light heavyweight champion Dimitri Bivol.\n\nParker\u2019s victory over Wilder came before Joshua stopped Otto Wallin with a fifth-round TKO in a heavyweight double-header.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bouts at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh were expected to set up a March bout between Wilder and Joshua.\n\nInstead, it appears Parker is in a position to step up in March, with the winner of that fight hoping to get a shot at the undisputed championship, which will be decided on February 17 when Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk meet in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe heavyweight division hasn\u2019t been unified this century.\n\nThe 31-year-old Parker, a big underdog according to FanDuel Sportsbook, looked the better fighter throughout, while the 38-year-old Wilder looked his age in a match-up of former heavyweight champions.\n\nParker (34-3-0) dominated from the start, landing powerful punches with his right hand while keeping Wilder on his heels with a smart and methodical approach.\n\n\u201cDangerous fight, tough fight, we trained very hard for this,\u201d Parker said.\n\n\u201cWe had great momentum coming into this fight. The strategy was to stay calm, stay relaxed, stay focused \u2026 every minute of every round. This is a great finish to the year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was only one round in which Wilder got the better of Parker.\n\n\u201cMy timing was off a little bit,\u201d Wilder said.\n\n\u201cHe did a great job of avoiding a lot of my punches. I did feel like I had the upper hand, but things happen. We move on to the next step.\u201d\n\nIn the main event, Wallin\u2019s corner called for the stoppage at the end of the fifth round.\n\nJoshua, a strong favourite, needed more than just a victory to convince sceptics his best days weren\u2019t behind him.\n\nThe British boxer earned some style points against the 33-year-old Wallin, who is from Sweden.\n\nJoshua (27-3-0) hadn\u2019t looked the same since holding the WBA, IBF and WBO titles. But the 34-year-old delivered a throwback performance, jabbing and moving forward with confidence while backing down Wallin (26-2-0).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA strong right-left combination in the fifth round eventually led to the stoppage.\n\n\u201cJust another fight. I respect Otto,\u201d Joshua said.\n\n\u201cNot so much a throwback, just another day in the office. I\u2019m just a gifted fighter that has a special gift and I use it to the best of my ability.\n\n\u201cWe just want to do whatever it takes to be victorious. All I want to be is just be victorious for as long as I can. I\u2019m searching for greatness.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Dmitrii Bivol defeated Lyndon Arthur in a unanimous decision that saw all three judges score it a 12-round sweep for the IBO light heavyweight and WBA super light heavyweight belts.\n\nThe early card also included five knockouts.\n\nAfter Opetaia, Daniel Dubois (20-2-0) registered a 10th-round TKO of Jarrell Miller (26-1-1) with eight seconds left in the final round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgit Kabayel (24-0-0) scored a fourth-round TKO of Arslanbek Makhmudov (18-1-0) in a scheduled 10-round heavyweight bout.\n\nFilip Hrgovic (17-0-0) stopped Mark De Mori (41-3-2) with a first-round TKO, and Frank Sanchez (24-0-0) opened the night with a seventh-round knockout of Junior Fa (20-3-0).\n\n\u00a9 AAP"

    "body": "Ouija boards and other attempts to converse with the dead are spiritually dangerous practices that should not be viewed as innocent fun, an exorcist priest told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We too often forget that there is much more to this world than meets the eye,\" Fr. Dan Reehil told Fox News Digital. \"Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist and they can have an impact on our life.\"\n\nRehill is a priest of the Diocese of Nashville. In 2018, he received exorcism training at Ateneo Pontificio Regina Apostolorum in Rome, and was installed as the exorcist of the Diocese of Nashville that same year.\n\nDO ANGELS EXIST? OVER HALF OF AMERICANS SAY YES, STUDY FINDS: \u2018COMFORT AND REASSURANCE\u2019\n\nAn exorcist, said Reehil, \"is a priest chosen and installed by a bishop to exercise the office of deliverance ministry. Exorcism is a specific form of prayer that the [Catholic] Church uses against the power of the devil.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church distinguishes between two forms of exorcisms, said Reehil. Exorcisms are either \"major\" or \"minor.\"\n\n\"A major exorcism is performed only for one, who is demonstrably possessed by a demon or demons, and may only be performed by a priest the bishop has specifically permitted to do so,\" said Reehil.\n\nConversely, a minor exorcism is associated with sacraments and blessings, said Reehil.\n\n\"Demonologists distinguish three levels of demonic incursion,\" explained Reehil. These three levels are temptation, obsession (which is also called \"oppression\") and possession.\n\n'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'\n\nTemptation, said Reehil, is something experienced by everyone.\n\nObsession is \"when demons torment people physically, spiritually, mentally or emotionally, or some combination of these.\"\n\nPossession, which is arguably the most well-known of the three levels, is when a demon or demons \"take physical possession of a person's body and make use of its faculties,\" said Reehil.\n\n\"Possession is usually intermittent, almost never an uninterrupted possessing of the person\u2019s body,\" he added.\n\nAttempting occult practices, such as purportedly trying to contact the dead via an Ouija board, are a way to open oneself up to demonic activity inadvertently, said Reehil.\n\n\"Demons lie and impersonate dead people,\" said Reehil. \"When asking a board for information about a deceased person, or a life decision, they are all too happy to embed themselves into your life. Using an Ouija board is inviting a demon into your life, whether the person has that intention or not.\"\n\nThe Ouija board was first developed in the late 19th century as a parlor game; these were formerly called \"talking boards.\"\n\nAt the time, s\u00e9ances and other spiritual practices were quite popular activities.\n\nAS CATHOLIC CHURCH FACES PRECARIOUS CULTURAL TIME, BISHOP ROBERT BARRON OF MINNESOTA MODELS THOUGHTFUL FAITH\n\nThe board consists of an alphabet, the words \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"goodbye,\" and the numbers zero through nine.\n\nTo operate the board, a person places their hands on a \"planchette,\" which spirits purportedly move to spell out answers to questions.\n\nIn 1890, a Baltimore spiritualist and medium named Helen Peters asked the talking board what she should call it, said the website for the Talking Board Historical Society. The board responded \"O-U-I-J-A,\" which it said meant \"good luck.\"\n\nThe Ouija board was patented the following year.\n\nLegend regarding the Ouija board's patent says that Peters accompanied attorney Elijah Bond to the patent office, where the two were instructed by the patent officer to prove that the board worked by spelling out his name, said Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nTHE EXORCIST, CHUCKY AND NEW HORRIFIC HAUNTS HIT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS ORLANDO'S HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS\n\nPeters reportedly asked spirits for assistance, and then spelled out the patent officer's name.\n\nIt is unclear if Bond or Peters somehow knew the patent officer's name ahead of time, but the patent was awarded on Feb. 10, 1891, by a \"white-faced and visibly shaken patent officer,\" said the magazine.\n\nThe boards were then mass-produced by the Kennard Novelty Company, which was sold to Parker Brothers in 1967.\n\nToday, the Ouija board is produced by Hasbro, which markets the product as a way to communicate with the \"spirit world.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Hasbro for comment but did not hear back by publication time.\n\n\"Enter the world of the mysterious and mystifying with the Ouija board! You've got questions and the spirit world has answers \u2014 and the uncanny Ouija board is your way to get them,\" said the Hasbro website.\n\nHALLOWEEN HORROR MOVIE HOMES AND THE STORIES BEHIND THEM: WOULD YOU DARE TO VISIT?\n\n\"What do you want to know? Ask your question with a friend using the planchette that comes with the board, but be patient and concentrate because the spirits can't be rushed. Handle the Ouija board with respect and it won't disappoint you,\" said the website.\n\nWhile the Ouija board is marketed as a toy or board game, Reehil, from his point of view, disagrees with this characterization.\n\nDivination and other occult practices are condemned by the Bible numerous times, said Fr. Reehil.\n\n\"Ouija boards should not be viewed in the same way as a typical board game,\" he said. \"Although it is advertised as a game, it is far from it,\" he added. \"Rather, it is a form of divination.\"\n\nDivination and other occult practices are condemned by the Bible numerous times, Reehil noted.\n\n\"The very action of using [the Ouija board] has profound spiritual consequences [that are] beyond our control,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nPerhaps the most famous instance of purported demonic possession connected to Ouija board usage was the case of \"Roland Doe,\" a young teenage boy from Maryland, who underwent numerous major exorcisms in 1949, said Reehil.\n\nDoe's story was adapted into the 1971 book \"The Exorcist\" by William Peter Blatty, which was then made into the 1973 movie starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair.\n\nReehil told Fox News Digital that he has personally seen six cases of demonic oppression that stemmed from Ouija board usage.\n\n\"The victims were left with night terrors, suicidal ideation, despair \u2014 and one man was impaled with chicken bones in his leg that flew across the kitchen,\" he said.\n\n\"Stay away from all forms of occult practices \u2014 and stay close to God.\"\n\n\"Once the deliverance prayers were prayed, and the participants renounced all participation with the demons, the demonic activity ceased,\" he also said.\n\n\"Whenever we seek to engage demons, we move away from the One True God,\" said Reehil.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdded the priest, \"Stay away from all forms of occult practices \u2014 and stay close to God.\"\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle."

Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nWhether it\u2019s something gory and macabre, silly and irreverent, or eerie and unsettling, the genre of horror is as rich and varied as the multitude of ghosts, ghoulies, and homicidal maniacs that go bump in the night.\n\nLooking for the best horror films available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Max, and Paramount Plus? No worries, we\u2019ve got the goods. We\u2019ve combed through the libraries of each of the major streaming platforms to bring you a list of our most recommended horror movies. Here are the best horror movies you can stream right now, from old classics to new hits. Our latest update added Encounters of the Spooky Kind.\n\nEditor\u2019s pick: Encounters of the Spooky Kind\n\nDirector: Sammo Hung\n\nCast: Sammo Hung, Chung Fat, Dick Wei\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel\n\nThis Halloween, I had one goal: Finally watch Sammo Hung\u2019s jiangshi (Chinese hopping vampire) martial arts comedy Encounters of the Spooky Kind. It was finally added to streaming via the Criterion Channel earlier this fall after years of being unavailable digitally. And reader, my priorities were correct, because this movie is an absolute blast.\n\nBest known for his collaborations with childhood friends Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, Sammo\u2019s excellence as a director, choreographer, and performer are on full display in what is frequently a one-man show.\n\nSammo directed the movie, co-wrote it, choreographed the action, and stars as Bold Cheung, a pedicab driver and skilled martial artist who\u2019s also kind of a dolt. He is dared to spend the night in a haunted house with a hopping vampire \u2014 a dare he accepts, because he is \u201cBold\u201d Cheung, after all. What follows is a Looney Tunes-style slapstick action horror movie with legitimate scares (the vampire makeup is terrific: gray with a gross texture, like a wet papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask), dazzling rhythmic martial arts choreography, and perfectly placed dashes of comedy (there\u2019s even an extended Duck Soup homage).\n\nSammo is truly one of the greatest directors to ever do it, but he doesn\u2019t get the proper credit globally because of the genres (and nation) he\u2019s primarily worked in. The jaw-dropping choreography and onslaught of funny bits are outstanding, but it\u2019s his skill with the camera that has always separated Sammo from his counterparts.\n\nBringing it back to his old friend Yuen Biao for a second \u2014 Biao co-stars as the silent vampire, and does a terrific job selling the undead creature\u2019s fight sequences with stiff limbs and startling hops. This movie is colorful, funny, scary, tense, and an incredibly fun time. If you like the Evil Dead movies, this is one you must check out; Sam Raimi basically directly ripped one of Spooky Kind\u2019s fight sequences for Evil Dead II. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nAlone\n\nDirector: John Hyams\n\nCast: Jules Willcox, Marc Menchaca, Anthony Heald\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Kanopy\n\nA taut spine-chiller from John Hyams (Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning), Alone is your classic woman-on-the-run thriller. Jessica (Jules Willcox), a recent widow, is in the midst of moving. If that wasn\u2019t enough stress, a creepy man (Marc Menchaca) appears to be following her on the road. After he slashes her tires, she crashes and wakes up in his basement. What follows is a tightly crafted thriller with great performances, outstanding direction, and enough tension to keep your heart pounding throughout the 98-minute running time. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nAnnihilation\n\nDirector: Alex Garland\n\nCast: Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nAnnihilation might be the creepiest movie about plants ever made (with all due respect to The Ruins.)\n\nAnnihilation follows a group of scientists (played by a phenomenal group of actors) investigating an area struck by a meteor. The area that was hit has slowly spread and grown into what\u2019s now known as The Shimmer, an area where nature seems to be taking over everything around it, but it\u2019s a different kind of nature; strange, unnaturally green plants grow over everything, and creatures (animals and humans) slowly merge with the vegetation around them. At the center of all of this is a lighthouse the group must reach. Annihilation helps realize this strange Earth-but-not incredibly well, with beautiful and haunting production design and a finale as memorable as any horror movie on this list. \u2014 Austen Goslin\n\nClimax\n\nDirector: Gaspar No\u00e9\n\nCast: Sofia Boutella, Romain Guillermic, Souheila Yacoub\n\nWhere to watch: Showtime\n\nClimax isn\u2019t for the faint-of-heart \u2014 and we\u2019re saying that in the context of a horror movies list. The movie is set at an all-night dance party inside a gymnasium, which turns sour after someone spikes the sangria with a little too much LSD. Climax is told in beautifully disorienting long takes that go from dozens of minutes of uninterrupted and propulsive dance sequences to hazy walks through hallways as the camera mimics the dizzy stumbling of the movie\u2019s characters. As the psychedelics kick in, so too do some of the attendees\u2019 long-held feuds, leading to disastrous and horrifying consequences. It\u2019s rare that a movie truly defies description, but if you\u2019ve got a strong stomach and a will to see something you haven\u2019t before, Climax is the perfect movie for you. \u2014AG\n\nCrimes of the Future\n\nDirector: David Cronenberg\n\nCast: Viggo Mortensen, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Kristen Stewart\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nMicroplastics: They\u2019re everywhere!\n\nThey\u2019re in our lungs, our blood, our food and drinking water; even the air we breathe. What the fuck is it doing to our bodies? We don\u2019t really know, but David Cronenberg\u2019s 2022 body horror drama sure has an idea of what it might mean for our children. Crimes of the Future imagines a world where humans have lost the ability to feel pain. In addition to that, several people have developed a disturbing disorder which causes their bodies to spontaneously spawn new organs.\n\nThis new reality has spawned a trend: Live surgery, wherein performance artists plagued with this condition tear into their own bodies in an effort to shape meaning out of this strange new biological fact. Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, a world-renowned performance artist who, alongside his partner Caprice (L\u00e9a Seydoux), stands on the cutting edge \u2014 both literally and figuratively \u2014 of this cultural phenomenon. When Saul\u2019s activities catch the attention of a mysterious group of evolutionary activists, as well as the lascivious eye of a government employee named Timlin (Kristen Stewart), he\u2019s forced to confront what he \u2014 and everyone else around him \u2014 is changing into, and whether what that is can even be considered \u201chuman\u201d anymore.\n\nAs macabre as it is moving, grotesque as it is sensuous; Crimes of the Future is an exquisite work of science fiction horror where surgery is the new sex and our very bodies have rebelled against us for the incalculable destruction we have inflicted on the planet. It\u2019s a film that exists in intimate conversation with the anxieties of our present, as well as one that represents a stunning return to form for one of cinema\u2019s most forward-thinking directors. Howard Shore\u2019s growling, guttural score is engrossing, while the leading trio of performances by Mortensen, Seydoux, and Stewart are a virtual match made in heaven in bringing to life this speculative slice of post-human hell on Earth. In short: It\u2019s a great film and highly recommended, but whatever you do, don\u2019t see it on a full stomach. Trust me. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nCure\n\nDirector: Kiyoshi Kurosawa\n\nCast: K\u014dji Yakusho, Tsuyoshi Ujiki, Anna Nakagawa\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s 1997 horror masterpiece Cure follows Kenichi Takabe (K\u014dji Yakusho), a Japanese detective frustrated by an inexplicable rash of seemingly unconnected murders that nevertheless all appear to be connected, despite none of the perpetrators having known each other or having any recollection as to what possessed them to do it. When Takabe\u2019s investigation leads him to a suspect, a student of psychology and mesmerism known as Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara), he finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that threatens to engulf anyone who gets too close.\n\nIn Cure, violence is less an act of premeditation or passion as it is a virus, coursing its way through the bloodstream of society, corrupting innocent bystanders not unlike aberrant cancer cells attacking from within without ever understanding why they did so in the first place. How do you confront a horror like that, much less stop it? The answer is as simple as it is terrifying: You can\u2019t. \u2014TE\n\nEyes Without a Face\n\nDirector: Georges Franju\n\nCast: Pierre Brasseur, \u00c9dith Scob, Alida Valli\n\nWhere to watch: Max, The Criterion Channel\n\nGeorges Franju\u2019s influential 1960 film is a master class in supernatural fantasy horror. An unsettling tale about a plastic surgeon (played by Pierre Brasseur) who kidnaps young women and performs surgery on them to try and find a face replacement for his daughter (\u00c9dith Scob), Eyes Without a Face is equal parts haunting and beautiful. Scob\u2019s iconic face mask in the movie was later referenced in her role in the also-excellent Holy Motors many decades later. \u2014PV\n\nHellraiser\n\nDirector: Clive Barker\n\nCast: Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, AMC+, Shudder, Tubi, Pluto, Hoopla\n\nClive Barker\u2019s 1987 directorial debut adapts his 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart to tell the story of Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins). The Cottons are a married couple who move into the home of Larry\u2019s recently deceased brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), with whom Julia had a previous affair. After inadvertently being resurrected by a drop of blood spilled by Larry on the floor of the house\u2019s attic, Frank seduces Julia into luring new men to the house so that he can drain their life force and fully regain his mortal form. Surrounding this core narrative is the the story of the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box Frank acquired before his untimely death. When solved, it conjures hellish beings known as Cenobites to the mortal plane of existence, which indulge in hellish exercises of sadomasochistic mutilation. Easily the best and most enduring of the Hellraiser movie series, Barker\u2019s 1987 original is a must-watch for horror fans. \u2014TE\n\nHereditary\n\nDirector: Ari Aster\n\nCast: Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro\n\nWhere to watch: Max\n\nHereditary is a victim of its own success. The poster child for the misguided term \u201celevated horror,\u201d and the subject of more than a few memes (particularly around telephone poles), the thing that often gets lost about Hereditary is that it\u2019s actually really fucking good. And it\u2019s damn scary too.\n\nThe movie follows Annie Graham, a difficult mother of two, who just lost her mom. During the funeral service, Annie notices quite a few people are here to mourn the mother she thought had no friends. She eventually learns this group of old people all belonged to the same bizarre semi-cult her mother did. And that\u2019s where the witchy stuff starts.\n\nFrom there everything descends into a complicated mishmash of tightly coiled family drama, supernatural plotting, and years-old resentments, and it\u2019s absolutely excellent. Who\u2019s to say which is scarier in this movie, the verbal immolation or the literal one?\n\nEven if you\u2019ve seen it already, you probably owe this movie a rewatch. You definitely remember that it\u2019s good, but you probably don\u2019t remember just how great it really is. Hereditary is elegantly creepy, right up until the point that it becomes terrifying. You can\u2019t really ask any more from a horror movie than that. \u2014Austen Goslin\n\nThe Host\n\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\n\nCast: Song Kang-ho, Byun Hee-bong, Park Hae-il\n\nWhere to watch: Max, Roku Channel, Hoopla, Kanopy\n\nThe Host was Bong Joon-ho\u2019s follow-up to the smash success serial killer drama Memories of Murder. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing South Korean film ever after its release and won Best Film at the Asian Film Awards and the Blue Dragon Film Awards.\n\nYears after chemicals are dumped into the Han River, a huge mutated fish monster emerges and kidnaps a young girl. Her father (Song Kang-ho) sets out to find and rescue her, before being kidnapped by the American scientists responsible for its existence. A fun monster thriller that doubles as insightful commentary on U.S. intervention, ecological disasters, and much more, The Host is a high mark in Bong\u2019s impressive filmography. \u2014PV\n\nHouse\n\nDirector: Nobuhiko Obayashi\n\nCast: Kimiko Ikegami, Miki Jinbo, Kumiko Ohba\n\nWhere to watch: Max, Criterion Channel\n\nFew movies are as weird and excellent as Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s House.\n\nThe bizarre ghost story follows a group of school girls who take a vacation to a haunted mansion in the countryside of Japan. Everything starts off well enough, but before long the kids are being attacked by demonic gates, getting eaten by pianos, or opening portals to hell \u2014 all with visually an inventive silliness few movies have ever matched. House isn\u2019t all that scary, but it is weird in all the best ways, and nothing else looks or feels like it. \u2014 AG\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness\n\nDirector: John Carpenter\n\nCast: Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube\n\nAmong the wildest movies John Carpenter has ever made (and that\u2019s saying something), In the Mouth of Madness follows insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill), who is hired to find a missing fame horror novelist. Things become increasingly unhinged as the plots of the author\u2019s books and the various monsters seem to invade the real world. Neill, a staple of this list, is absolutely fantastic responding to the horrors of hell, slowly becoming exactly as off-kilter as they are. By the time the movie makes it to the third act, the door to hell is halfway open and Trent is ready to dive headfirst into the void, which is honestly how every movie\u2019s third act should go.\n\nThis is also the third in Carpenter\u2019s apocalypse trilogy, which also includes two other stone-cold classics, The Thing and Prince of Darkness. They aren\u2019t on this list, but you should watch them anyway. \u2014 AG\n\nLet the Right One In\n\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\n\nCast: K\u00e5re Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Prime Video, Roku Channel, Crackle, Hoopla, Kanopy\n\nA 12-year-old Swedish boy finds a friend in a vampire who looks roughly his age, but is actually an old vampire permanently trapped in the body of a young child. The film is kaleidoscopic, each viewing revealing something different than the last. The first time I saw the film, I was a pessimistic college student, and I read the central relationship as a warning about the parasitic nature of love. After college, the children\u2019s bond reminded me of the impermanence of youth, and why growing up is a mixed blessing. This past year, I was far more focused on the girl\u2019s relationship with her caretaker, an older man who sacrifices everything for her existence.\n\nThe film was adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist\u2019s 2004 novel of the same name, which inspired not just this Swedish film, but a 2010 American adaptation, a comic-book prequel, and two stage plays. The latter has its own legacy \u2014 it was adapted by the magnificent National Theater of Scotland, and it eventually had a run at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in 2015. Few books inspire so much additional great art. So I suppose I\u2019m recommending the book just as much as the film. \u2014Chris Plante\n\nMalignant\n\nDirector: James Wan\n\nCast: Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young\n\nWhere to watch: Max\n\nThere was just no way to see it coming. After the Conjuring and Insidious franchises, plus blockbuster turns with Furious 7 and Aquaman, James Wan could have cashed in chips to make another moody franchise-starter to stretch his jump-scare muscles. Instead, he made Malignant, a high-emotion giallo stuffed into dingy \u201990s direct-to-video pastiche like some kind of horror-movie turducken. Wan pulls back the layers in an almost tedious fashion: The pregnant Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is first the victim of domestic abuse, then she encounters another killer, and then she starts dealing with psychotic episodes tied to her childhood imaginary friend Gabriel, and theeeeen it\u2019s revealed\u2026 Well, please go behold it.\n\nStrung together with a melodramatic cover of The Pixies\u2019 \u201cWhere Is My Mind,\u201d reveling in horror tropes to the point of parody, the final twists of Malignant are some of the most gratifying lunacy of the year, and the acrobatic actor Marina Mazepa brings it all home in a display of gruesome ballet. I won\u2019t explain anything more out of fear of spoilers \u2014 just get on the Malignant train. Wan put his dream (nightmare?) on screen for us all to enjoy. \u2014Matt Patches\n\nThe Mist\n\nDirector: Frank Darabont\n\nCast: Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden\n\nWhere to watch: Digital rental/purchase\n\nAny fan of Stephen King worth their salt knows that the so-called king of horror has a lot of movie adaptations of his work. Few films have managed to eclipse, let alone successfully adapt, King\u2019s capacity for horror storytelling, with the exception of (a) Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining and (b) Frank Darabont\u2019s The Mist.\n\nDarabont\u2019s third adaptation of a Stephen King story, the film stars Thomas Jane (The Expanse) as a Hollywood poster artist living in Maine who, along with his wife and son and the rest of his neighbors, takes shelter in a supermarket in the wake of a mysterious storm that covers the town in a deadly mist.\n\nSupernatural, otherworldly horrors abound throughout The Mist, but the greatest horror of all is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 humanity itself, as seen in the way the townspeople succumb to the temptation to scapegoat those among themselves under the influence of a local religious fanatic. The ending is a gut-punch and sincerely one of the most chilling in any mainstream horror film of its time. If you\u2019ve managed to go unspoiled until now, I won\u2019t ruin the surprise, but needless to say, it\u2019s worth it. \u2014TE\n\nNight of the Living Dead\n\nDirector: George A. Romero\n\nCast: Duane Jones, Judith O\u2019Dea, Marilyn Eastman\n\nWhere to watch: Max, Peacock, MGM Plus, Paramount Plus, Roku Channel\n\nThe movie that launched the modern zombie film in the United States, George A. Romero\u2019s debut feature was written, directed, photographed, and edited by the nascent zombie film master on a shoestring budget, which only adds to the eerie atmosphere and grounded terror. In this film, a group of survivors hide out in an abandoned house in western Pennsylvania at the start of a zombie apocalypse. Led by the level-headed Ben (Duane Jones), the group not only has to deal with the conflict of zombies trying to break in, but internal conflicts stemming from disagreements on how to handle their precarious predicament.\n\nNight of the Living Dead is the first example of Romero\u2019s typical blend of jaw-dropping (and stomach-churning) practical effects and astute social commentary. Fun fact: This movie came out a month before the MPAA film rating system, which meant a heaping amount of controversy when children were able to see the quite graphic movie in theaters. And another fun fact: Night of the Living Dead was never copyrighted and is in the public domain because of an error by the original theatrical distributor. \u2014PV\n\nPossession\n\nDirector: Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski\n\nCast: Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Heinz Bennent\n\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus, Metrograph\n\nOutside of the most ardent of cinephile circles, Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski isn\u2019t a name that inspires enthusiastic recognition in the United States. Known for his transgressive brand of arthouse cinema, \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s career was stymied by Communist authorities in his homeland of Poland, with many of his early films being either heavily censored, banned, or, in one instance, nearly destroyed upon release. It also doesn\u2019t help that the few films of his that have been released in the States have since gone out of print \u2014 though that appears to be changing soon.\n\nIf you do know \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s name, it\u2019s likely for his 1981 psychological horror film Possession, a film whose cult status among horror connoisseurs has only been amplified in the decades since its release by its difficulty to obtain on physical media or to view online. Fortunately for everyone, that\u2019s no longer the case.\n\nSet in Cold War-era West Berlin, \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s film stars Jurassic Park\u2019s Sam Neill as Mark, a Russian spy who returns home to find that his wife, Anna (Isabelle Adjani), has left him and wants a divorce. When Anna refuses to divulge why, only saying that she has not left him for someone else, Mark grows suspicious and has her tailed. What he eventually discovers is a horrifying secret beyond his comprehension, one which awakens a long-dormant wellspring of anxiety, resentment, and despair between the two that threatens to tear apart not only their small family, but their very sanity as well.\n\nInspired by \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s own tumultuous divorce in 1976 and his subsequent struggles with suicidal ideation, Possession blurs the line between the autobiographical and the phantasmagorical, with hysterical performances by Neill and Adjani that vacillate between disturbing, comical, and disquietingly sympathetic. An inspiration for everything from Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar to the 2016 music video for Massive Attack\u2019s \u201cVoodoo in My Blood,\u201d Possession is an essential watch for any serious horror fan. \u2014TE\n\n[REC]\n\nDirectors: Jaume Balaguero, Paco Plaza\n\nCast: Manuela Velasco, Ferran Terraza, Martha Carbonell\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video\n\nOne of the best and most disturbing found-footage movies ever, [REC] follows a TV reporter and camera person who follow emergency workers into an apartment building, only to discover the dark truth inside: Some of the residents are turning into monsters. Set squarely in the zombie-craze of the mid-2000s, [REC]\u2019s undead creatures owe quite a bit to the raving cannibal infected of 28 Days Later, but the Spanish movie\u2019s flesh-eaters are quite a bit creepier and more disturbed than their predecessors. While many found-footage movies obscure their scariest moments, [REC] uses the format to enhance its creeping dread and drag out the character\u2019s slow careful exploration of the apartment building, ramping the tension up to 11 just in time for the downright terrifying finale. \u2014 AG\n\nSputnik\n\nDirector: Egor Abramenko\n\nCast: Oksana Akinshina, Fedor Bondarchuk, Pyotr Fyodorov\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nIf you\u2019re hungry for a great piece of contemporary Russian sci-fi horror (i.e., something not directed by either Andrei Tarkovsky or Yakov Protazanov), then Egor Abramenko\u2019s 2020 directorial debut is just the film you\u2019re looking for.\n\nSet during 1983 at the height of Cold War tensions, Sputnik (which for your information is Russian for \u201cfellow traveler\u201d) centers on Tatyana (Oskana Akinshina), an uncompromising young psychiatrist with a staunch attitude with regard to the ends justifying the means. Tatyana is recruited by the Soviet military to treat Konstantin (Pyotr Fyodorov), a wounded cosmonaut and the lone survivor of a mysterious satellite crash. Only upon arriving at the remote hospital facility housing the patient and interacting with him does Tatyana come to realize the horrifying truth: Konstantin did not in fact return from space alone; rather, his body has now become the unwitting host to an organism unlike anything seen on Earth. Caught between her duty to study the creature and her desire to save Konstantin from further harm, Tatyana must make a hard decision upon which the very survival of all humanity may rest.\n\nWhat makes Abramenko\u2019s debut so compelling is how it takes the basic premise of the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d thought experiment and twists it repeatedly (and successfully) to dramatic emotional effect. Akinshina (The Bourne Supremacy) delivers a convincing and compelling performance as Tatyana, a woman forced to confront and overcome the uncompromising attitude that had once assured her success but now threatens to endanger not only another man\u2019s life, but potentially the lives of everyone on the planet along with her own soul. Fyodorov, for his own part, delivers a sympathetically complex (and on occasion, implicitly sinister) performance as Konstantin, a Russian \u201chero\u201d torn between his perceived duty to his country and his emotional obligation to a loved one he all but abandoned before embarking on his most recent mission. The creature design in this movie is terrific, as is the cinematography and the film\u2019s score.\n\nHaving previously been slated for a world premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently dumped on video-on-demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sputnik is exactly the kind of horror movie this list was intended to spotlight: a kind of rare gem of intellectually and viscerally stimulating horror that otherwise goes unappreciated if not given the opportunity to shine. \u2014TE\n\nSuspiria\n\nDirector: Dario Argento\n\nCast: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci\n\nWhere to watch: Tubi, Kanopy\n\nOne of the best-looking movies of all time with one of the best soundtracks of all time. What\u2019s better than that?\n\nDario Argento\u2019s Suspiria tells the story of Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who moves to Germany to study at the prestigious Tanz Akademie. It just so happens that the academy is run by witches. As the facade of the school unravels, Suzy\u2019s fellow students slowly start going missing or dropping dead in increasingly bizarre and horrible ways.\n\nWhile the plot for Suspiria is interesting, what really makes the movie great is how it looks and how it sounds. Everything about the production design, the costumes, and the colors is eccentric in ways no other horror movie has ever matched. Couple all that with the incredible and haunting soundtrack from European rock band Goblin, and Suspiria becomes an unforgettable horror classic that everyone should see at least once. \u2014 AG\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre\n\nDirector: Tobe Hooper\n\nCast: Marilyn Burns, Gunnar Hansen, Allen Danziger\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock, Shudder, AMC Plus, Tubi, Freevee\n\nAnother shoestring production gone huge, Tobe Hooper\u2019s 1974 masterpiece made over $30 million at the box office on a budget of around $140,000. The movie follows a group of friends who find themselves hunted by a family of cannibals in the middle of Texas, and is a chilling, violent fever dream that permanently lodges itself in the minds of those who watch it.\n\nEight films have followed, including a Netflix version in 2022, but the original stands out as an unhinged encapsulation of pure chaos and terror. At a tight 83 minutes, the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre is well worth the small time investment to catch up on one of the most influential horror movies ever made. \u2014PV\n\nThe Thing\n\nDirector: John Carpenter\n\nCast: Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock\n\nJohn Carpenter\u2019s postmodern creature feature takes the idea of alien monsters and makes them simultaneously more recognizable and more gross and unworldly than in any other movie in history. The Thing, the second adaptation of the excellent novella Who Goes There?, remains thrilling, terrifying, and absolutely disgusting more than 40 years after its release.\n\nThe Thing follows a group of researchers working at an Antarctic base. Suddenly, a dog from a local Norwegian camp rushes into their base, with Norwegian men hot on its heels, trying to kill it by any means necessary. However, once the American crew takes the dog in and shelters it, they discover it\u2019s an alien that can transform into any living creature, mimicking it perfectly \u2014 and that makes every one of them a suspect.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the great paranoid thriller premises of all time, but it just so happens to also be filled with gross and fantastic alien gore. There\u2019s nothing quite like The Thing. \u2014AG\n\nThe Unfriended movies\n\nDirector: Levan \u201cLeo\u201d Gabriadze (Unfriended); Stephen Susco (Unfriended: Dark Web)\n\nCast: Shelley Hennig, Moses Storm, Renee Olstead (Unfriended); Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel (Unfriended: Dark Web)\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel (Unfriended); Digital rental/purchase (Both movies)\n\nAs many people have learned over the past few years, there aren\u2019t that many things scarier than a video call you can\u2019t leave.\n\nA masterfully contained horror movie that makes full use of its (at the time) groundbreaking gimmick, Unfriended is a tense teen horror movie that takes place entirely on a character\u2019s laptop screen. Definitely watch it on a laptop if you can, and check out the very good sequel Unfriended: Dark Web if you dug this one. \u2014PV\n\nFrom our list of the best horror movies on Netflix:\n\nLevan Gabriadze\u2019s Unfriended pulls the audiences through the screen \u2014 almost literally. Viewed entirely from the perspective of a computer desktop, 2014 supernatural horror film centers around a Skype call between a group of high school students who are joined by an unknown presence known only as \u201cbillie227.\u201d What at first appears to be a prank swiftly morphs into something much more horrific, as the mysterious stranger begins to reveal terrifying secrets about each of the friends before killing them off one by one. Unfriended is thoroughly gripping extrapolation of our always-online world, a world where vengeful poltergeists and doxxing exist side by side and no secret or offense goes undiscovered or unpunished. \u2014TE\n\nUs\n\nDirector: Jordan Peele\n\nCast: Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s already a horror master just three movies into his career, but Us probably still doesn\u2019t have the reputation it deserves. His 2019 psychological slasher had the unfortunate fate of following up the cultural phenomenon of Get Out, so it had a hard time breaking through, in the way that sophomore projects often do. But taken on its own terms, Us is a fantastic little horror movie with tons of atmosphere and an underground society\u2019s worth of great scares.\n\nThe movie follows the Wilson family, whose vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of doppelg\u00e4ngers who match up with each member of the family perfectly. The clones, it turns out, are called Tethered, and where they come from is very complicated. But before any kind of explanation of the Tethered, what we see is a parade of violent attacks, home invasions, and some very tense encounters between Lupita Nyong\u2019o and herself.\n\nUs may not be Peele\u2019s best movie, but it is a fascinating mix of slasher thrills and world- building, supported by a fantastic cast all operating at their A games. While the entire cast is great, Elizabeth Moss is a particular standout for her extremely brief but extraordinarily loathsome role as one of the family\u2019s friends. Her performance gives this movie so much of its weird off-kilter vibe, and leads to some of its most unstintingly and gleefully over-the-top violence. Alongside the terrifying tone, Peele manages to build an entire second world underneath our own, and will give you a very unhealthy fear of what you\u2019re really seeing when you look in the mirror. \u2014AG"

The file was originally proposed back in April 2021 but it\u2019s taken months of tricky three-way negotiations to get a deal over the line. The development means a pan-EU AI law is definitively on the way.\n\nGiving a triumphant but exhausted press conference in the small hours of Friday night/Saturday morning local time key representatives for the European Parliament, Council and the Commission \u2014 the bloc\u2019s co-legislators \u2014 hailed the agreement as hard fought, a milestone achievement and historic, respectively.\n\nTaking to X to tweet the news, the EU\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen \u2014 who made delivering a regulation to promote \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI a key priority of her term when she took up the post in late 2019 \u2014 also lauded the political agreement as a \u201cglobal first\u201d.\n\nThe \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa AI Act is a global first.

A commitment we took in our political guidelines \u2013 and we delivered. I welcome today's political agreement. \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 8, 2023\n\nProhibitions\n\nFull details of what\u2019s been agreed won\u2019t be entirely confirmed until a final text is compiled and made public, which may take some weeks. But a press release put out by the European Parliament confirms the deal reached with the Council includes a total prohibition on the use of AI for:\n\nbiometric categorisation systems that use sensitive characteristics (e.g. political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race);\n\nuntargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases;\n\nemotion recognition in the workplace and educational institutions;\n\nsocial scoring based on social behaviour or personal characteristics;\n\nAI systems that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent their free will;\n\nAI used to exploit the vulnerabilities of people (due to their age, disability, social or economic situation).\n\nThe use of remote biometric identification technology in public places by law enforcement has not been completely banned \u2014 but the parliament said negotiators had agreed on a series of safeguards and narrow exceptions to limit use of technologies such as facial recognition. This includes a requirement for prior judicial authorisation \u2014 and with uses limited to a \u201cstrictly defined\u201d lists of crime.\n\nRetrospective (non-real-time) use of remote biometric ID AIs will be limited to \u201cthe targeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a serious crime\u201d. While real-time use of this intrusive AI tech will be limited in time and location, and can only be used for the following purposes:\n\ntargeted searches of victims (abduction, trafficking, sexual exploitation),\n\nprevention of a specific and present terrorist threat, or\n\nthe localisation or identification of a person suspected of having committed one of the specific crimes mentioned in the regulation (e.g. terrorism, trafficking, sexual exploitation, murder, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, participation in a criminal organisation, environmental crime).\n\nThe Council\u2019s press release on the deal emphasizes that the provisional agreement \u201cclarifies that the regulation does not apply to areas outside the scope of EU law and should not, in any case, affect member states\u2019 competences in national security or any entity entrusted with tasks in this area\u201d. It also confirms the AI act will not apply to systems exclusively for military or defence purposes.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the agreement provides that the regulation would not apply to AI systems used for the sole purpose of research and innovation, or for people using AI for non-professional reasons,\u201d the Council added.\n\nCivil society groups have reacted sceptically \u2014 raising concerns the agreed limitations on state agencies\u2019 use of biometric identification technologies will not go far enough to safeguard human rights. Digital rights group EDRi, which was among those pushing for a full ban on remote biometrics, said that whilst the deal contains \u201csome limited gains for human rights\u201d, it looks like \u201ca shell of the AI law Europe really needs\u201d.\n\nReal-time public facial recognition (RBI): disappointingly, but not surprisingly, member states resisted a full ban. The Parliament fought hard to narrow exceptions and add more safeguards, but it doesn't look like it will be enough to stop widespread biometric mass surveillance; \u2014 Ella Jakubowska (@ellajakubowska1) December 9, 2023\n\nRules for \u2018high risk\u2019 AIs, and general purpose AIs\n\nThe package agreed also includes obligations for AI systems that are classified as \u201chigh risk\u201d owing to having \u201csignificant potential harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, environment, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cMEPs successfully managed to include a mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment, among other requirements, applicable also to the insurance and banking sectors. AI systems used to influence the outcome of elections and voter behaviour, are also classified as high-risk,\u201d the parliament wrote. \u201cCitizens will have a right to launch complaints about AI systems and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems that impact their rights.\u201d\n\nThere was also agreement on a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system of guardrails to be applied to \u201cgeneral\u201d AI systems, such as the so-called foundational models underpinning the viral boom in generative AI applications like ChatGPT.\n\nAs we reported earlier, the deal reached on foundational models/general purpose AIs (GPAIs) includes some transparency requirements for what co-legislators referred to as \u201clow tier\u201d AIs \u2014 meaning model makers must draw up technical documentation and produce (and publish) detailed summaries about the content used for training in order to support compliance with EU copyright law. For \u201chigh-impact\u201d GPAIs (defined as the cumulative amount of compute used for their training measured in floating point operations is greater than 10^25) with so-called \u201csystemic risk\u201d there are more stringent obligations.\n\n\u201cIf these models meet certain criteria they will have to conduct model evaluations, assess and mitigate systemic risks, conduct adversarial testing, report to the Commission on serious incidents, ensure cybersecurity and report on their energy efficiency,\u201d the parliament wrote. \u201cMEPs also insisted that, until harmonised EU standards are published, GPAIs with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice to comply with the regulation.\u201d\n\nThe Commission has been working with industry on a stop-gap AI Pact for some months \u2014 and it confirmed today this is intended to plug the practice gap until the AI Act comes into force.\n\nWhile foundational models/GPAIs that have been commercialized face regulation under the Act, R&D is not intended to be in scope of the law \u2014 and fully open sourced models will have lighter regulatory requirements than closed source, per today\u2019s pronouncements.\n\nThe package agreed also promotes regulatory sandboxes and real-world-testing being established by national authorities to support startups and SMEs to develop and train AIs before placement on the market.\n\nPenalties and entry into force\n\nPenalties for non-compliance can lead to fines ranging from \u20ac35 million or 7% of global turnover to \u20ac7.5 million or 1.5 % of turnover, depending on the infringement and size of the company, per the parliament.\n\nThe Council\u2019s PR further stipulates that the higher sanction (7%) would apply for violations of the banned AI applications, while penalties of 1.5% would be levied for the supply of incorrect information. Additionally, it says sanctions of 3% could be imposed for violations of other AI Act obligations but also notes that the provisional agreement allows for \u201cmore proportionate caps\u201d on administrative fines for SMEs and start-ups in case of infringements. So there looks to be some scope for AI startups to face smaller penalties for infringements than AI giants may invite.\n\nThe deal agreed today also allows for a phased entry into force after the law is adopted \u2014 with six months allowed until rules on prohibited use cases kick in; 12 months for transparency and governance requirements; and 24 months for all other requirements. So the full force of the EU\u2019s AI Act may not be felt until 2026.\n\nCarme Artigas, Spain\u2019s secretary of state for digital and AI issues, who led the Council\u2019s negotiations on the file as the country has held the rotating Council presidency since the summer, hailed the agreement on the heavily contested file as \u201cthe biggest milestone in the history of digital information in Europe\u201d; both for the bloc\u2019s single digital market \u2014 but also, she suggested, \u201cfor the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have achieved the first international regulation for artificial intelligence in the world,\u201d she announced during a post-midnight press conference to confirm the political agreement, adding: \u201cWe feel very proud.\u201d\n\nThe law will support European developers, startups and future scale-ups by giving them \u201clegal certainty with technical certainty\u201d, she predicted.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the European Parliament, co-rapporteurs Drago\u0219 Tudorache and Brando Benifei said their objective had been to deliver AI legislation that would ensure the ecosystem developed with a \u201chuman centric approach\u201d which respects fundamental rights and European values.\n\nTheir assessment of the outcome was equally upbeat \u2014 citing the inclusion in the agreed text of a total ban on the use of AI for predictive policing and for biometric categorization as major wins.\n\n\u201cFinally we got in the right track, defending fundamental rights to the necessity that is there for our democracies to endure such incredible changes,\u201d said Benifei, who just a few weeks ago was sounding doubtful a deal could be found. \u201cWe are the first ones in the world to have a horizontal legislation that has this direction on fundamental rights, that supports the development of AI in our continent, and that is up to date to the frontier of the artificial intelligence with the most powerful models under clear obligation. So I think we delivered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have always been questioned whether there is enough protection, whether there is enough stimulant for innovation in this text, and I can say, this balance is there,\u201d added Tudorache. \u201cWe have safeguards, we have all the provisions that we need, the redress that we need in giving trust to our citizens in the interaction with AI, in the products in the services that they will interact with from now on.\n\n\u201cWe now have to use this blueprint to seek now global convergence because this is a global challenge for everyone. And I think that with the work that we\u2019ve done, as difficult as it was \u2014 and it was difficult, this was a marathon negotiation by all standards, looking at all precedents so far \u2014 but I think we delivered.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also chipped in with his two euro-cents \u2014 describing the agreement clinched a little before midnight Brussels\u2019 time as \u201chistoric\u201d. \u201cIt is a full package. It is a complete deal. And this is why we spent so much time,\u201d he intoned. \u201cThis is balancing user safety, innovation for startups, while also respecting\u2026 our fundamental rights and our European values.\u201d\n\nClear road ahead?\n\nDespite the EU very visibly patting itself on the back tonight on securing a deal on \u2018world-first\u2019 AI rules, it\u2019s not quite yet the end of the road for the bloc\u2019s lawmaking process as there are still some formal steps to go \u2014 not least the final text will face votes in the parliament and the Council to adopt it. But given how much division and disagreement there has been over how (or even whether) to regulate AI the biggest obstacles have been dismantled with this political deal and the path to passing the EU AI Act in the coming months looks clear.\n\nThe Commission is certainly projecting confidence. Per Breton, work to implement the agreement starts immediately with the set up of an AI Office within the EU\u2019s executive \u2014 which will have the job of coordinating with the Member State oversight bodies that will need to enforce the rules on AI firms; and overseeing the most advanced AI models, including by contributing to fostering standards and testing practices. A scientific panel of independent experts will be appointed to advise the AI Office about GPAI models. \u201cWe will welcome new colleagues\u2026 a lot of them,\u201d said Breton. \u201cWe will work \u2014 starting tomorrow \u2014 to get ready.\u201d\n\nOpposition to the inclusion in the AI package of tiered rules for general purpose AIs has been led, in recent weeks, by France \u2014 and French AI startup Mistral, which had been lobbying for a total carve out from obligations for foundational models/GPAIs. In the event the deal agreed by the Spanish presidency does contain some obligations for GPAIs and foundation models. So it\u2019s not the total carve out Mistral and its lobbyists have been pushing for.\n\nResponding to news of the political deal last night, France\u2019s digital minister\u2019s office put out a statement attributed to Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot which said (translated from French using AI): \u201cWe will be carefully analyzing the compromise reached today, and in the coming weeks we will ensure that the text preserves Europe\u2019s ability to develop its own artificial intelligence technologies, and safeguards its strategic autonomy.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear how much of a carve out Mistral\u2019s business might enjoy under the deal agreed. Asked about this during the press conference, Artigas suggested the French AI startup would \u2014 once commercialized \u2014 be likely to fit in the \u201clow tier\u201d for GPAIs, meaning it would have only limited transparency obligations, since she said it does not hit the high capacity compute threshold triggering the systemic risk obligations (as she said it\u2019s using what\u2019s thought to be 10^23 of compute, not 10^25).\n\nHowever, as Mistral is currently still in an R&D and pre-training phase for their models, she said they would be excluded from even the low tier compliance requirements.\n\nThis report was updated to include the response from the French digital ministry; link to the Council\u2019s PR; and with additional details from the presser \u2014 including remarks about how the law might apply to Mistral. We also added details on civil society\u2019s response"

    "body": "The mysterious respiratory illness that may have sickened scores of dogs across the country could be caused by a new type of bacterial infection that may be very good at evading the canine immune system, researchers say. Some dogs have died from the illness, which starts with causes a cough that can last for weeks, runny eyes and sneezing.\n\nIn a development that might help shed light on the illness, which has affected a variety of dog breeds, researchers at the University of New Hampshire\u2019s Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory and the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies told NBC News they have identified a pathogen that might be what\u2019s making pets sick.\n\nThrough a genetic sequencing of samples from an initial group of 30 dogs from New Hampshire who were infected last year and then an additional 40 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts who got sick this year, the researchers say they have discovered a previously unknown germ.\n\nThe pathogen is \u201ca funky bacterium,\u201d said Dr. David Needle, pathology section chief at the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than a normal bacterium in its size and in the size of its genome. Long story short, it\u2019s a weird bacterium that can be tough to find and sequence.\u201d\n\nThe germ \u201cis new as a potential cause of disease, but it is likely to be\u2014 or to have evolved from \u2014 a component of the dog microbiome,\u201d he said. Dogs as well as humans have multiple types of harmless bacteria and other microorganisms living both inside and outside the body. In the gut, they are thought to aid in digestion.\n\nThe bacterium was discovered after a painstaking search.\n\n\u201cAfter initial sequencing showed there were no known viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens, time consuming and dogged work by graduate student Lawrence Gordon showed that 21 of the initial 30 samples from New Hampshire had some genetic material from one atypical bacterial species,\u201d Needle said.\n\nThe UNH team is sharing its results prior to publishing a research article, hoping they will give veterinarians some information as they deal with other respiratory syndrome outbreaks, he said.\n\nScientists aren\u2019t even sure yet whether the same bug is making dogs sick across the nation. Many researchers have wondered whether it was a bacterial or a viral pathogen. One thing veterinarians do know is that the germ is something they don\u2019t recognize.\n\nMike Stepien, a spokesperson for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said in an email Wednesday the agency is working with multiple state animal health officials and diagnostic labs regarding the respiratory illness in dogs that, \"in rare cases, has progressed rapidly to death.\"\n\n\"APHIS and partners have not yet definitively identified the cause of illness,\" Stepien responded in an email. \"There are no reports of human illness affiliated with these cases at this time.\"\n\nNew Hampshire is one of a handful of states that have reported cases of the respiratory infection in dogs.\n\nThe Oregon Agriculture Department has received more than 200 case reports from veterinarians around the state since the beginning of August, spokesperson Andrea Cantu-Schomus said in an email. A very small percentage of the dogs have died, Cantu-Schomus said.\n\nOther states with possible cases include:\n\nIn conversations with veterinarians, Dr. Karl E. Jandrey, a professor of clinical small animal emergency and critical care at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, has heard of potential cases in North Carolina, Rhode Island and Virginia, as well.\n\nBecause there is no test yet for the illness and because many of the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, such as canine influenza and Bordetella (kennel cough), it\u2019s unknown exactly how many dogs have been affected. With hundreds of cases identified by symptoms reported only in Oregon, it\u2019s likely there are thousands.\n\nNormally, to determine what antibiotics might work best against a particular type of bacteria, labs grow the bugs in a petri dish and then try to kill them with various medications. Needle and his colleagues have not been able to grow the new bacteria in the lab. Nevertheless, its structure offers some clues about which medications might be the best choice to fight it, he said. The antibiotic doxycycline may be effective, he suggested.\n\nIf it turns out that the New Hampshire researchers have found the right microbe, that may explain why some dogs are getting very sick, said Jandrey.\n\nSmaller pathogens are likely to have an easier time making it past a dog\u2019s defenses in the upper respiratory tract and getting down into the lungs, he said. \u201cIf it goes into the lungs, there\u2019s a risk of pneumonia,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat are the dog infection symptoms?\n\nAccording to Oregon\u2019s Cantu-Schomus, the dogs\u2019 illnesses largely develop in three ways:\n\nAs an inflammation of the tubes that connect the throat to the lungs that is minimally or not responsive to antibiotics.\n\nAs chronic pneumonia that is minimally or not responsive to antibiotics.\n\nAs acute pneumonia that rapidly becomes severe and often leads to severe illness or possibly death in as little as 24 to 36 hours.\n\nIf a dog has a cough that won\u2019t quit and other respiratory symptoms, it\u2019s recommended that the owner contact a veterinarian right away.\n\nWhile the respiratory symptoms seem to be like a viral illness, testing has been negative for a virus, Cantu-Schomus said.\n\nIt\u2019s very unlikely that the cause will turn out to be viral, said Colin Parrish, a professor of virology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University. \u201cWith the sequencing methods people use to look for unknown viruses, its signature would have been clear in a few days,\u201d he added.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that the New Hampshire scientists could have hit upon the right pathogen, although their results need to be confirmed by more research, he said.\n\nWhat owners should do\n\nThe American Kennel Club\u2019s chief veterinarian offered advice for both dog owners and their vets.\n\nFirst, owners should make sure their pets are fully vaccinated and boosted against the known canine diseases, said Dr. Jerry Klein, a practicing vet for 35 years and who was emergency department head emeritus at MedVet Chicago and currently works at the McKillip Animal Hospital in Chicago.\n\nKlein recommends that veterinarians suggest a full respiratory panel when people bring in sick dogs, but acknowledges that may be an expense some owners can\u2019t afford.\n\nIf a dog\u2019s veterinarian doesn\u2019t suggest the panel, then owners should request it; that will help determine if the germ is one that vets already know about or is something new.\n\nPeople can call their local emergency vets to find out if there has been an increase in respiratory infections coming in for treatment, Klein said.\n\n\u201cThat would be a way to find out whether there\u2019s been an uptick in your area,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is, then they should try to protect against exposure by avoiding grooming establishments and daycare.\u201d\n\nKlein also recommends that groomers and daycare facilities not allow dogs to share food and water dishes.\n\nEven though a record number of Americans are expected to travel during the holiday season, experts recommend that dog owners keep their pets out of kennels and other areas, such as dog parks, where infection might be more likely because of crowded conditions and close contact.\n\n\u201cWhen you congregate a bunch of animals together, there\u2019s a larger likelihood of getting an infectious disease from other dogs,\u201d said Dr. Kurt Williams, director of the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine at Oregon State University.\n\nStill, he said, there are some facilities where you are less likely to have a problem because of how they are designed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling people to work closely with their vet,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd to make sure their dog has all the vaccines available, in particular those for respiratory diseases we are familiar with.\u201d\n\nAnother option is for owners to hire a house sitter, Needle said. \u201cOr hire a dog walker,\u201d he added. \u201cIt might not be perfect, but it\u2019s better than nothing. Also, you might want to consider having Thanksgiving at home.\u201d\n\nUltimately, your dog might be happier at home with a house sitter or a dog walker stopping by multiple times during the day than going to a kennel, Jandrey said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to leave them in their own environment,\u201d he added.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

    "body": "Bacteria's rising resistance to antibiotics is making the drugs obsolete. Scientists are fighting back with viruses (pictured), CRISPR, designer molecules and cell-slicing enzymes.\n\nThe bacteria may have entered her flesh along with shrapnel from the bomb detonated in Brussels Airport in 2016. Or perhaps the microbes hitched a ride on the surgical instruments used to treat her wounds. Either way, the \"superbug\" refused to be vanquished, despite years of antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe woman had survived a terrorist attack but was held hostage by drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterial strain often picked up by surgery patients in hospitals. Only by combining antibiotics with a new, experimental treatment did doctors finally rid her of the superbug .\n\nDevastating drug-resistant bacterial infections like this one are all too common, and they represent an ever-growing threat to global health. In 2019, antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly killed roughly 1.27 million people worldwide and contributed to an additional 3.68 million deaths. In the U.S. alone, drug-resistant bacteria and fungi together cause an estimated 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths each year.\n\nAnd the problem is getting worse: Seven of the 18 concerning bacteria tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are becoming more resistant to common antibiotics considered essential for maintaining public health. Meanwhile, drug companies have been slow to make new antibiotics capable of beating the microbes. Fewer than 30 antibiotics currently in the development pipeline target \"priority\" bacteria , as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), and most of those drugs are still vulnerable to resistance, just like their predecessors.\n\nThis table of select antibiotic-resistant bacteria demonstrates how rapidly important types of resistance developed after the approval and release of new antibiotics. (Image credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adapted by Live Science from the CDC's \"Select Germs Showing Resistance Over Time\" Fact Sheet.)\n\nSo some scientists are looking beyond traditional antibiotics for new weapons that won't fuel the rise of superbugs. Their emerging arsenal features viruses that kill bacteria; CRISPR; and microbe-slaying molecules. They hope that these experimental treatments, some of which have been tested in patients, will kill superbugs without promoting resistance.\n\n\"The vision, for me, is that we move beyond antibiotics and really just see a much broader palate of options,\" Chase Beisel, leader of the RNA synthetic biology research group at the Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research in Germany, told Live Science.\n\nBut until these new therapeutics are ready for prime time, the world needs to curtail its overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which experts say is speeding up the rate at which these lifesaving drugs become obsolete.\n\nRelated: Superbugs are on the rise. How can we prevent antibiotics from becoming obsolete?\n\nHow antibiotic resistance emerges and spreads\n\nAntibiotics either directly kill bacteria or slow their growth , leaving the immune system to finish the job. The drugs work in several ways \u2014 by preventing bacteria from building sturdy walls or making copies of their DNA , for instance. Growth-slowing antibiotics usually disrupt ribosomes, the factories in which bacterial cells make proteins.\n\nMany antibiotics shoot for the exact same molecular targets , and so-called broad-spectrum antibiotics' mechanisms are so universal that they work on both major classes of bacteria : gram-positive and gram-negative, which are distinguished by the makeup and thickness of their cell walls. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, in particular, pressure both harmful and helpful bacteria in the body to evolve defensive strategies that eject or disable the drugs, or else alter their targets.\n\nDrug-resistant bacteria can transfer their resistance to additional bacteria in several ways. (Image credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adapted by Live Science from the CDC's \"How Resistance Moves Directly Germ to Germ\" Fact Sheet.)\n\nBacteria can pick up such defenses through random DNA mutations, or by swapping \"resistance genes\" with other bacteria via a process called horizontal gene transfer. By making these gene transfers, bacteria can quickly spread such mutations to additional bacterial populations in the body and in the environment.\n\nThe misuse of antibiotics in health care, as well as in agriculture, has given bacteria endless opportunities to develop resistance, raising the chance that once-treatable infections will become life-threatening.\n\nRelated: New 'concerning' strain of drug-resistant gonorrhea found in U.S. for 1st time\n\nHarnessing viruses to fight bacteria\n\nOne of the proposed alternatives to antibiotics was first conceived more than a century ago, before the 1928 discovery of penicillin. Called phage therapy, it uses bacteria-infecting viruses called bacteriophages, or simply \"phages,\" which typically kill the germs by invading their cells and splitting them open from the inside.\n\nPhages can also pressure bacteria into giving up key tools in their drug resistance tool kits. For example, a phage called U136B can have this effect on E. coli. To infiltrate E. coli, the phage uses an efflux pump, a protein E. coli normally uses to pump antibiotics out of the cell. If the E. coli tries to change this pump to escape the phage, it reduces the bacterium's ability to pump out antibiotics.\n\n\"If phage therapy were used at a global scale ... it would not lead to the same problem of widespread resistance.\" Paul Turner, Yale University\n\nAnd unlike with antibiotics, bacteria are unlikely to gain widespread resistance to phage therapy , said Paul Turner , director of the Center for Phage Biology and Therapy at Yale University.\n\nTurner and other experts have concluded that, \"if phage therapy were used at a global scale, that it would not lead to the same problem of widespread resistance to it, the way that antibiotic use has led to that problem,\" he told Live Science.\n\nHere's why: Antibiotic resistance has been dramatically accelerated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics , especially broad-spectrum antibiotics that work on a variety of bacteria. Phages, by contrast, can have much narrower targets than even narrow-spectrum antibiotics \u2014 for instance, targeting a protein found in only one or a few strains within one bacterial species.\n\nRelated: New drugs could stymie superbugs by freezing evolution\n\nThe target bacterium can still evolve resistance to an individual phage \u2014 but by picking the right combination of phages, scientists can make it so that the bacterium's evolution comes at a cost, Turner said. This cost might be a decrease in virulence or an increased vulnerability to antibiotics.\n\n(Image credit: Graphic made by Olha Pohrebniak via Getty Images. Adapted by Live Science.)\n\nTo date, phage therapy has mostly been tested through a regulatory framework known as \"compassionate use\" in patients like the Brussels Airport bombing victim, whose infections had no other treatment options. Phage therapy has shown success in these settings, and in a recent observational study of 100 patients who received phages alongside antibiotics.\n\nSo far in clinical trials, though, phage therapy generally hasn't worked better than standard antibiotics or a placebo. Topline results from two recent trials hint at the treatment's effectiveness in specific lung and foot infections, but the full results have yet to be released.\n\nSuccess in future trials will be key to getting phages into the clinic, Turner said. Those trials will have to show the therapy works for multiple types of infections, determine dosage and confirm phage therapies don't hurt helpful bacteria in the body, he added.\n\nTurning bacteria's defenses against them\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas system can be used to snip DNA at precise locations. Here, a Cas enzyme (dark pink) is preparing to cut through a target DNA strand (blue) and is being told where to cut by an RNA strand (yellow). (Image credit: Meletios Verras via Getty Images)\n\nAlthough made famous as a powerful gene-editing tool, CRISPR technology was actually adapted from an immune system found in many bacteria: CRISPR-Cas.\n\nThe key components of this immune system include molecular scissors, known as Cas proteins, and a memory bank of DNA snippets that a bacterium has collected from phages that once infected it. By tapping its memory bank, CRISPR-Cas can guide its lethal scissors to a precise point in an invading phage's DNA and snip it like a piece of ribbon.\n\n\"The CRISPR machinery gets into a set of cells, but only those that have the sequence or sequences you picked will be attacked and killed.\" Chase Beisel, HIRI\n\nOn occasion, though, rather than attacking phages, CRISPR-Cas can accidentally go after the bacterial cell's own DNA , triggering a lethal autoimmune reaction. This phenomenon inspired Beisel and his colleagues to explore using CRISPR-Cas to shred bacterial cells' DNA.\n\n\"The real draw of it is that it is a sequence-specific tool,\" meaning it targets only the DNA you tell it to, and not sequences present in other bacteria, Beisel told Live Science. So, once administered to a patient, \"the CRISPR machinery gets into a set of cells, but only those that have the sequence or sequences you picked will be attacked and killed.\"\n\nHow do you get CRISPR-Cas into the right bacteria? Various research groups are testing different delivery methods, but at present, the best strategy seems to be loading CRISPR machinery into a phage that infects the target bacterium, Beisel said.\n\nRelated: Scientists invent 'shape-shifting' antibiotic to fight deadly superbugs\n\nBeisel is a co-founder and scientific adviser of Locus Biosciences, a biotech company that's currently testing a CRISPR-enhanced phage therapy in a midstage, roughly 800-person trial. This approach couples the bacteria-killing prowess of phages with the ability of CRISPR-Cas to destroy essential bacterial genes. As with CRISPR-less phage therapies, clinical trials are needed to determine the treatment's safety profile and appropriate dosing.\n\n\"I can see these [treatments] coming about in the five- to 10-year time frame,\" Beisel said.\n\nDesigner molecules to kill bacteria\n\nBeyond phages and CRISPR, scientists are developing antibiotic alternatives that harness bacteria-slaying peptides \u2014 short chains of protein building blocks\u2014 and enzymes, specialized proteins that jump-start chemical reactions. These molecules differ from antibiotics because they can kill a very narrow range of bacteria by targeting bacterial proteins that cannot easily gain resistance to their attacks.\n\nLab-made molecules called peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are some of the most promising candidates. These engineered molecules can be designed to block bacterial cells from building essential proteins that are crucial to their survival. PNAs do this by latching onto specific mRNA, genetic molecules that carry the instructions for building proteins from the cell's control center to its protein construction sites. PNAs cannot enter bacterial cells on their own, though, so they're typically attached to other peptides that easily pass through the bacterial cell wall.\n\nBy targeting proteins that cells cannot change without harming themselves, PNAs can avoid triggering drug resistance, Beisel explained. The engineered molecules could also be made to target proteins that directly contribute to antibiotic resistance, for example, the efflux pumps used to push antibiotics out of cells or the enzymes capable of disabling the drugs. By emptying a germ's drug resistance tool kit, PNAs can then make it vulnerable to standard treatments.\n\nOne approach for killing bacteria is to use lysins, or enzymes that tear open bacterial cell membranes and cause the microbes' contents to spill out. (Image credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)\n\nAntibacterial PNAs are still being tested in lab dishes and animals and have not yet moved into human trials. And, scientists need to make sure PNA-based treatments don't inadvertently mess with human cells or helpful bacteria.\n\nRelated: 'Death screams' of swarming bacteria help their comrades survive antibiotic attacks\n\nIn addition to peptides like PNAs, enzymes called lysins are another promising treatment option. Lysins are used in nature by phages to split bacteria open from the inside. They act like tiny swords that slice through the outer wall of a bacterial cell, spilling its guts. The molecular sabers are unlikely to promote resistance because bacteria cannot easily change the essential cell-wall components that lysins target.\n\nLysins slaughter bacteria quickly upon contact, and they can be very specific, killing some types of bacteria while sparing others. Furthermore, lysins can be tweaked in the lab to change which bacteria they target, boost their potency and improve their durability in the body.\n\nSome lysins have entered mid- and late-stage human trials with hundreds of participants, in which they've been tested as supplementary treatments to antibiotics but garnered mixed results.\n\nAntibiotic stewardship can save lives, in the meantime\n\nUntil these next-gen bacteria slayers make it to market, immediate measures must be taken to stall the rise of superbugs, by preventing the misuse of antibiotics that pressures bacteria to evolve resistance in the first place.\n\n\"By reducing individual risk, you anticipate that you will drop the overall population-level risk.\" Dr. Shruti Gohil, INSPIRE-ASP Trials\n\nFor example, doctors can be more diligent about confirming that bacteria, not viruses, are behind a patient's infection before prescribing antibiotics, said Dr. Shruti Gohil , a lead investigator of four INSPIRE-ASP Trials , federally funded research aimed at improving hospitals' antibiotic use. Other safeguards can include auditing doctors' prescriptions to see if narrower-spectrum drugs could be used instead of broad ones, or requiring special clearance for the broadest-spectrum drugs. These steps are essential not only in hospitals but everywhere antibiotics are prescribed, from primary care to dentistry, Gohil said.\n\nEach interaction between a doctor and their patient matters.\n\nGohil stressed that \"by reducing individual risk, you anticipate that you will drop the overall population-level risk,\" and eventually slash the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bugs."

    "body": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nAmazon's October Prime Day sale officially ended on Wednesday, but a few of the deals are still live as we head into the weekend. If you were hoping to check off a few more names from your holiday gift list or buy something for yourself at a discount, see what remains on sale below. We combed through our coverage over the past few days to find the best of what's left. While Amazon has returned most of their own devices, like Echos and Kindles, back to their full prices, a handful of products from other brands like Google, Samsung and Anker, have maintained the lows they hit on Prime Day. Here are the best deals from Prime Big Deal Days that you can still get right now.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 went down to $269 for October Prime Day and it's still on sale. That's lowest price we've seen since it came out a few months ago. You can't get a better smartwatch than this one if you have an Android phone (bonus points if you have a Samsung phone), and it's smaller and lighter than previous versions. Samsung brought back the spinning bezel on the Classic version, which is which makes the software's UI easier to navigate, plus it has improved performance and updated health and fitness tracking tools.\n\nApple MacBook Air M2 (15-inch)\n\nPhoto by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M2) $1,049 $1,260 Save $211 The MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and this deal brings the entry-level 15-inch model back down to the best price we've seen. Other SKUs with more RAM and storage are also on sale. $1,049 at Amazon\n\nThe 15.3-inch version of Apple\u2019s MacBook Air is still down to $1,049 for an entry-level model with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. That matches the best price we\u2019ve seen and takes $250 off Apple\u2019s list price. The MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and we gave the 15-inch model a review score of 96 earlier this year, as it covers just about all of the things we look for in a quality mainstream notebook. Compared to the 13.6-inch version, it also includes a more powerful speaker system and a slightly upgraded GPU. The SSD in this base configuration is technically slower than the one in higher-capacity SKUs, but that shouldn\u2019t be a major problem unless you\u2019re looking to do more complex work. In general, you wouldn\u2019t buy the Air for things like high-res media editing, though its M2 chip is still plenty powerful for everyday tasks.\n\nIf you do need more storage space, the 512GB model with 8GB of RAM is on sale for a low of $1,249. Variants with double the RAM are up to $250 off as well. Meanwhile, the 13.6-inch MacBook Air isn\u2019t discounted on Amazon, but it\u2019s down to $899 at Best Buy. That\u2019s $200 off the notebook\u2019s list price.\n\nSony WF-1000XM5\n\nSony's WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds went down to $278 for Prime Day and are still going for that price today. That's a $22 discount and their best price yet. We think these are the best wireless earbuds on the market right now. Sony improved upon it's already remarkable buds with a more comfortable fit, better sound quality and features likes adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K\n\nThe previous generation of Fire TV Stick 4K dropped to $23 for the sale and is one of the few Amazon devices still on sale. It has the same processor, RAM and storage as the standard Fire TV Stick, but it can stream 4K HDR content in all its glory. It also supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos, while a picture-in-picture live view feature can show you feeds from compatible security cameras right on your TV screen.\n\nDo note, though, that this is the previous model of the streaming stick. The newly refreshed Fire TV Stick 4K isn't sale but has a faster processor and supports Wi-Fi 6.\n\nAnker Soundcore Motion +\n\nOne of the top Bluetooth options in our speaker guide is Anker\u2019s Soundcore Motion +, which gives out good sound for its price point. The $100 MSRP is discounted to $70 if you clip the on-page copuon. That's a 30 percent discount and an all-time low. It has a bright and bassy output and offers EQ customization in the app. Plus it\u2019s water-resistant, so you can take it to the park or on a hike and share your good taste in music with whoever is nearby.\n\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\n\nThe top budget pick in our gaming headphones buying guide, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, is on sale for $36. That\u2019s a dollar more than it went for on Prime Day and only a modest $4 discount over its street price recently, but it's still close to lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 doesn\u2019t have the most balanced or detailed sound, but its V-shaped signature gives action scenes a nice level of impact, and its mic quality belies the dirt-cheap price. The design is comfortable too, though it\u2019s made from cheap-feeling plastic.\n\nShokz OpenRun Pro\n\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is down to $125 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is $25 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked but still $55 below its usual going rate. This is a recommended pair of bone conduction headphones, which means it hugs the side of your head and delivers sound by passing vibrations through your skull. (It\u2019s not as uncomfortable as it sounds.) The main benefit is that this leaves your ear canals completely open, so you can enjoy a playlist or podcast without being shut out from the outside world. The downside, usually, is that you don\u2019t get as full a sound as you would with a traditional pair. That\u2019ll still be the case here, but we\u2019ve found the OpenRun Pro to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers. They\u2019re fairly comfy and get up to 10 hours of battery life beyond that.\n\nLogitech G535\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a wireless headset, the Logitech G535 is back down to $80, which is about $25 below its average street price. This is an honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, as we like its lightweight design, Bluetooth support and agreeable, relatively well-balanced sound. It forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level though, and its mic makes voices sound a little too thin. It also doesn't work with Xbox consoles. But if you really want a wireless gaming headset for less than $100, it\u2019s well worth a look.\n\nSamsung Smart Monitor M8\n\nThe Samsung Smart Monitor M8 is down to just $500, which is $200 off its starting price (though it regularly sells for $600) and the lowest price we've seen thus far. This 32-inch display has built-in apps and allows you to access streaming services, just like you would on a smart TV. It can also act as a smart home hub, showing you your smart camera feeds and more. This discounted model is the updated 2023 version of the monitor that launched at CES 2022.\n\nGoogle Indoor Nest Security Cam\n\nA slew of Google Nest home security devices are still on sale the day after Prime, including the battery-powered Nest Cam that can go inside or outside your home. Typically priced at $180, the security cam dipped down to $120 for Amazon's October Prime Day event. The Nest Cam works with smart speakers and displays enabled with Alexa or the Google Assistant and can last up to seven months depending on how much activity it picks up. Its weather-resistant build and magnetic mount should make it easy to install on most surfaces. It sends live alerts to your phone and will even allow for on-demand check-ins without a subscription, though it only stores the last three hours for free. For six months of stored footage, you'll need a Nest Aware membership.\n\nGoogle Nest Thermostat\n\nGoogle Google Nest Thermostat $90 $130 Save $40 The Google Nest Thermostat lets you control your heating and cooling from anywhere and suggests tweaks to help you save money. This Black Friday deal takes $40 off the list price. $90 at Amazon\n\nIn other Google deals, the Nest Thermostat is on sale for just $90, which is only about $10 more than the lowest price we've tracked and $40 off Google's MSRP. This is Google's entry-level smart thermostat, but it still lets you control your heating and cooling from anywhere, suggests tweaks to help you save money, and in some cases, can entitle you to rebates from your utility provider. It's all relatively easy to program, and it works with Google's Nest Hub and other smart displays like the Echo Show.\n\nBeats Studio Pro\n\nThe Beats Studio Pro headphones are on sale for $180 right now. which is a dollar more than they sold for on Prime Day and still a sizable $170 discount. We reviewed these back in July when they came out and gave them a decent review score of 81. Unfortunately they didn't push any of the top picks from our our best headphones list off their pedestals. They aren't bad, however, offering pleasant, even-handed sound and good noise cancellation. Though Beats is now owned by Apple, these headphones still play nice with Android. There's no wear detection and the mostly plastic design isn\u2019t super premium, but at this price, you may not care.\n\nTribit StormBox Micro 2\n\nThe Tribit StormBox Micro 2 is another small speaker we like that puts out decent volume for its size, and for Prime day it went down to $48, which is $12 off its usual going rate. Right now it's on sale for $60, but an on-page 15 percent coupon brings it back to that Prime Day low. This device has a strap on its back that works well on belts, backpacks, or even bike handlebars, so it\u2019s easy to take on the road. And \"on the go\" is where the StormBox Micro 2 performs best, as it\u2019s more about portable volume than pure fidelity.\n\nGoogle Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E\n\nThe Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E is holding strong at $300 right now for a pack of three routers. That's within a dollar of the lowest price it's sold for on Amazon. It's one of the best Wi-Fi 6 router systems you can get at the moment thanks to its easy setup process, convenient Google Assistant integrations and Matter and Thread support. If you're looking for a not-too expensive way to upgrade your home Wi-Fi system, and one that will take little time to set up, Google's is the one to get.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\n\nOur favorite streaming stick, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K, remains at $37 after the sale. It packs a ton of features into an affordable package, including 4K HDR streaming capabilities, Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and private listening when you have a pair of headphones. And since it's so small, it makes for a great travel entertainment device too.\n\nHisense U6K\n\nThe Hisense U6K is one of the more affordable TVs. And the 55- and 65-inch models are still down to $400 and $548, respectively. We\u2019ve seen these deals before, but each matches an all-time low. The U6K is has received generally positive reviews around the web, as it's one of the few budget-level sets with quantum dots, full-array local dimming and a mini-LED backlight. All of that should help it deliver better contrast and color volume than most TVs in its price range. It\u2019s not ideal for gaming though, as it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks HDMI 2.1 ports. In general, it can\u2019t match the brightness or viewing angles of a more expensive set, but it looks to be a good buy if you\u2019re on a tighter budget.\n\nFor a well-reviewed midrange model, the Hisense U8K provides much better contrast and peak brightness, plus more gaming-friendly features like ability to play 4K content at up to a 144Hz refresh rate. That one is down to $748 for a 55-inch model and $998 for a 65-inch set.\n\niRobot Roomba 694\n\niRobot's Roomba 694 dropped to $199 for Prime Day and stayed there. While that's still $20 more than the lowest we've seen it go, it's still a good deal on our favorite cheap robot vacuum. It's got strong suction power, an attractive design and easy to use app. It'll be a good option for robo-vac novices, or anyone that doesn't want to fuss too much with an automatic dirt sucker. It clears hard and carpeted floors well, and it automatically returns to its base once a cleaning job is finished so it can recharge.\n\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD\n\nThe Samsung Pro Plus microSD card is on sale for $20 right now. It's our top pick in our best microSD card guide because it was the most consistent of the ones we tested, with some of the best overall speeds and all of the important ratings that a good card should have: U3, V30 and A2. It'll be a great pick for your tablet, smartphone or Nintendo Switch, and it comes with a full-sized adapter in case you need to use it with a camera or connect it to your computer.\n\nCrucial MX500\n\nThe Crucial MX500 internal drive is on sale for $46 right now. It's been an Engadget favorite for a while thanks to its sequential read speeds of 560MB/s and a standard 2.5-inch design that should make it easy to swap in for your desktop's or laptop's used-up drive.\n\nOther great deals for after Prime Day\n\nAnker 511 Charger\n\nAnker 511 Charger (Nano 3) $20 $23 Save $3 See at Amazon\n\nNew Apple Watches don\u2019t come with power adapters, so if you\u2019re looking for one that can deliver a quick charge, we recommend Anker's 511 (Nano 3) charging brick. It\u2019s down to $20 which is a mild, $4 discount, but still a welcome price for a worthwhile smartwatch accessory.\n\nOtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank\n\nOtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank 15,000 mAh $36 $45 Save $9 See at Amazon\n\nThe OtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank is currently just $36 for the 15,000mAh capacity model, which is the version we tested and recommend in our portable battery guide. This pack looks sharp and delivers a fast and reliable charge via USB-C or USB-A.\n\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC Card for Nintendo Switch\n\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC-Card Licensed for Nintendo-Switch $18 $31 Save $13 See at Amazon\n\nIf you need more room on your Switch, SanDisk's officially licensed microSDXC card is a good pick, particularly when it\u2019s on sale. Right now a 128GB model is within a dollar of its all-time low at just $18.\n\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD card\n\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD Memory Card + Reader $23 $38 Save $15 See at Amazon\n\nOur favorite microSD card for most people is the Samsung Pro Plus. It had the fastest sequential write speeds and random performance of any card we tested, and the USB reader that comes with included with this listing helps it reach higher speeds on compatible devices. It\u2019s listed at $38 for the set (though it often goes for $25), and now Prime Day in October brings it to $23.\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice."

    "body": "Colorado fans, you're back. For now.\n\nA 43-yard pass from Shedeur Sanders on the Buffaloes' final drive helped set up Alejandro Mata for the game-winning 43-yard field goal with 12 seconds left, delivering Colorado the 27-24 win over Arizona State for their first Pac-12 win of the season. It snaps their eight-game conference losing streak.\n\nSanders had a mediocre day by his lofty standards, but his 239 yards and a touchdown were enough in perhaps Colorado's most crucial game so far. It brought the team to 4-2, but had it lost, it would have been much harder for the Buffs to finish the season bowl eligible. A win gives them a leg up in a competitive conference, particularly facing four ranked teams down the stretch of the season.\n\nIf Colorado wants to solidify a bowl game, it'll have to fix many things, one of them being the offensive line. It allowed five sacks on Sanders, bringing the season total to a nation-leading 31. The defense picked up five sacks themselves to maintain pressure on Trenton Bourguet.\n\nFor Arizona State, Bourguet put all he could into Saturday's narrow loss. He's one of two healthy quarterbacks on the roster, and passed for 335 yards and a touchdown. The Sun Devils had a real shot at their first conference win. But as the game came to a close, Bourguet seemed roughed up and slow, though he did drive the team down the field 94 yards in 13 plays for the game-tying touchdown with 50 seconds left.\n\nLuckily for Arizona State, next week is a bye week. What's not so lucky is that it'll go on to play three ranked teams over the following three weeks.\n\nWe didn't see the worst of either team, though we didn't see the best either. Colorado needed a bounce back win and got one. Meanwhile Arizona State kept on struggling, falling to 1-5.\n\nMORE: Watch Colorado vs. Arizona State live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nThe Sporting News tracked updates and highlights from college football's Week 6 game between Colorado and Arizona State.\n\nColorado vs. Arizona State score\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Final Colorado 7 7 0 13 27 Arizona State 7 10 0 7 24\n\nColorado vs. Arizona State results, highlights from Week 6 game\n\nFINAL: Colorado 27, Arizona State 24\n\nColorado 27, Arizona State 24\n\n10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2013 Absolutely clutch.

He will miss the remainder of this game as well as the first half against Washington in two weeks.\n\n9:10 p.m. \u2013 That's the fourth sack allowed by the Colorado O-line. The Buffaloes now lead FBS with most sacks allowed this season at 30.\n\n8:52 p.m. \u2013 Skattebo is heating up under the sun.

Less than a minute is left until halftime.\n\n8:09 p.m. \u2013 Sanders finds Jimmy Horn Jr. for 24 yards. Colorado is within striking distance, the ASU 39, with only two minutes left.\n\n8:06 p.m. \u2013 ASU's head coach Kenny Dillingham could not be more unhappy with the referees, who ruled Bourguet's run just short of a first down. It's fourth down for the Sun Devils.\n\nColorado 7, Arizona State 14\n\n7:48 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2013 Cam Skattebo pushes through the huddle for the score! It's his fifth rushing touchdown of the season. ASU now leads 14-7 with 6:38 left in the half.\n\n7:45 p.m. \u2013 Andre Johnson reaches over the pylon with one hand, but the ball is knocked out. The play is being reviewed for a touchdown.\n\n7:41 p.m. \u2013 Colorado is called offsides, giving Arizona State a first down at the Buffs' 48.\n\n7:34 p.m. \u2013 After scoring a touchdown on its opening possession, Arizona State has three straight three-and-outs.\n\n7:30 p.m. \u2013 The Sun Devils record their third sack of the day already, this time forcing fourth down for the Buffaloes. Safe to say their defense came prepared.\n\nEnd of first quarter: Colorado 7, Arizona State 7\n\nColorado 7, Arizona State 7\n\n7:17 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2013 The Buffs tie it up! Needing one yard on the fourth down, Sanders hands it off to Xavier Weaver who weaves his way into the end zone.

    "body": "Pastor Jesse Bradley of Auburn, Washington runs Grace Community Church.\n\nHe's ministered to many, many people struggling with a variety of faith dilemmas and issues in their lives.\n\nIn this month of October 2023, as Americans grapple with a variety of issues, he addressed the notion of positive thinking \u2014 and shared with Fox News Digital what it would \"look like to change your thinking and shift in a new direction.\"\n\nWASHINGTON PASTOR, ONCE GRAVELY ILL, SHARES HOW \u2018THE POWER OF THE SECOND THOUGHT\u2019 TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE\n\nSaid Pastor Bradley, \"Psychologists report that we have in between 6,000 and 60,000 thoughts a day, based on the person and situation. The National Science Foundation shares that up to 80% of our first thoughts are not helpful, even destructive.\"\n\nWhat happens is that \"when life is difficult, we can become flooded with thoughts that are drenched in fear, worry, stress, selfishness, impurity, selfishness and lies. We do not have to believe, harbor or entertain negative first thoughts. We can be proactive by intentionally choosing our second thought.\"\n\nIt is no accident that the pastor's new book, his second, is called \"The Power of the Second Thought.\"\n\nIt dives into the power of understanding that the first thoughts we have are not always the best \u2014 and that it's wise to take some time and get to the \"second thoughts,\" which can yield greater understanding.\n\nSTORYTELLER REVEALS HIS FAITH AT WORK: \u2018I REFUSE TO TRY TO SCREW SOMEONE IN THE NAME OF BUSINESS\u2019\n\nSaid Bradley to Fox News Digital in emailed comments this week, \"How can we choose a positive attitude and approach during the day? Reject and replace!\"\n\nHe gave this list of examples:\n\nReplace \"People just slack and gossip at my job\" with \"I will work with all my strength, even when no one is looking\"\n\nReplace \"There's no hope for my future\" with \"I am thankful for today and will keep doing the next right thing\"\n\nReplace \"My children are annoying\" with \"My children are a gift from God\"\n\nReplace \"I'll never have good friendships\" with \"I will pursue and support the people that I respect the most\"\n\nReplace \"No one really cares about me\" with \"God is with me and loves me every day\"\n\nSaid Bradley, \"Johns Hopkins reports that there are links between positive thinking and health. People with a positive outlook are less likely to have a heart attack or cardiovascular event.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a roadmap for finding hope or the tools to handle the intensity of my loss and pain.\"\n\nAlso, \"Research from the University of North Carolina points to positive people being more resilient and finding more solutions to problems. A Harvard study shares that optimism reduces the risk of dying prematurely \u2014 from overcoming trauma, making the most of your opportunities to overall life satisfaction, positivity makes a difference.\"\n\nWASHINGTON PASTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THE PAIN OF PUTDOWNS AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN FAITH: \u2018ASK GOD FOR COURAGE\u2019\n\nThe pastor said he wrote his most recent book, \"The Power of the Second Thought,\" to help people gain habits to strengthen their mental health.\n\nBradley graduated from Dartmouth College and was playing professional soccer when he became ill \u2014 something that took 10 years to fully recover from. He said finding hope during that time was challenging but is how he changes his \"hopeless first thoughts.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a roadmap for finding hope or the tools to handle the intensity of my loss and pain,\" he said.\n\nFAITH DILEMMA IN FOCUS: \u2018IT\u2019S SUNDAY AND I HAVEN'T GONE TO CHURCH \u2014 WHAT DO I DO?'\n\nHe said turning to Jesus for a deeper meaning and learning to not take his \"first thoughts\" for fact was crucial to his overall mental health.\n\n\"The Word of God is living and active, bringing strength, courage, wisdom, and protection,\" he said.\n\n\"God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours, but when we spend time, each day reading His Word and listening to the voice of the Good Shepherd, we are filled with new thoughts that change the trajectory of our lives.\"\n\nBradley also shared his dos and don'ts of positive thinking.\n\nHe said it's not \"denial and pretending that there are no challenges,\" he said.\n\n\"Positive thinking is not flattery and frivolous compliments.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nRather, positive thinking is realistic, full of truth and love \u2014 and aligned with heaven and scripture.\n\n\"Positive thinking is not self-consumption, self-absorption or selfishness. Positive thinking is not creating unrealistic expectations for other people and putting extra stress on them to be perfect.\"\n\nBradley said, \"Positive thinking is a vital aspect of loving your neighbor, nourishing your mind, discerning between light and darkness, good and evil and right and wrong.\"\n\n\"Positive thinking leads to taking action and improving situations. Positive thinking brings out the best in the people around you. Positive thinking rejects excuses, takes responsibility, and overcomes setbacks.\"\n\nThe pastor went on to explain that Jesus brought more positivity than anyone \u2014 which is why it's important to keep faith aligned with that practice of positive thinking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Jesus exudes a trustworthy positivity that is full of meaning, faithfulness, and transformation,\" he noted.\n\n\"God renews our thinking and vision, empowers us to make intentional choices about our focus and perspective and trains us how to win the battle of our minds,\" he added.\n\nBradley said, \"Positive thinking is relational, and there is no greater source of joy in our lives than God.\""

    "body": "In a phone interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Los Angeles-based actor Jonathan Roumie spoke of his Christian faith, his prayer life and his hope that others may find peace and serenity during this Advent season of 2023 \u2014 because \"any opportunity to connect to Jesus is a welcome one,\" he said.\n\nRoumie, perhaps best known for his role as Jesus Christ in \"The Chosen,\" has paired up with Hallow, the No. 1 prayer app in the world, for a special Advent prayer challenge for this holy season of preparation for Christmas. The 25-day prayer challenge began Monday \u2014 and as part of the effort, both he and actor Liam Neeson guide people through a variety of prayers, meditations, Bible readings and more.\n\nThis is no mere gig, however, for Roumie.\n\nHe is a committed Christian and Catholic, with his own personal story of growing closer to God and continuing to do so each day.\n\nHALLOW APP ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION WITH LIAM NEESON FOR NEW ADVENT SERIES THIS YEAR\n\nPeople can \"disconnect from the chaos of the real world, the divisiveness, the anxiety\" that exists, said Roumie, by connecting with Jesus through prayer.\n\nThey can find \"peace and a deeper relationship with Christ, and I think that's really the goal of the prayer challenge,\" he said.\n\nRoumie said that building a habit of prayer \"is easier than people think.\"\n\nHe added, \"As you consistently tap into that habit, you find your relationship with Jesus growing deeper and deeper, just automatically. And as a result, you then experience much more peace, tranquility and serenity in your life and the ability to really muscle through some of the most difficult obstacles and challenges that life can throw at you,\" he said.\n\nHere is more of Fox News Digital's conversation with Roumie about the 25-day prayer challenge during Advent, which started on Monday \u2014 and about Roumie's own faith beliefs.\n\n\u2018Deep gratitude\u2019\n\nFox News Digital: In the midst of some of the most trying times today, how do you \u2014 and how does anyone \u2014 keep a focus on prayer, on God, on a connection with God? It's very, very easy to get distracted in today's world.\n\nJonathan Roumie: Yes, and I think that for me, I'm very easily distracted \u2014 and technology is one of the things that contributes to that distraction.\n\nBut in this case, I have such a deep gratitude to the technology that's arrived in the form of this app \u2014 of the Hallow app. I can literally go to my phone and if I find myself or my mind wandering \u2014 or my anxiety building \u2014 all I have to do is literally click on the app and just start praying or meditating on one of the challenges or one of the prayers.\n\nFIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT IS A REMINDER TO \u2018WATCH\u2019 AND PREPARE FOR CHRIST'S SECOND COMING, SAYS FAITH LEADER\n\nThere are thousands of prayers on this app. And I'm instantly transported into a sacred space, no matter where I am.\n\nNo matter what, if you live in a major city or if you live in a place that's just really busy, you can pop on your headphones and connect to the app. You start praying with a meditation and you're instantly just transported.\n\nThis is something that I've been so grateful for \u2014 and especially as we go into the hubbub and the busyness of the Christmas season, it's something that I'm relying on daily, to be able to just cut through all that noise.\n\n\u2018Transformative for people\u2019\n\nQuestion: Are people reaching out to you about your involvement with the app and asking you more about it?\n\nRoumie: I've had so many people say they've cultivated a relationship with Jesus through prayer because they heard me talk about the app, or because they watched \"The Chosen\" and then they started seeing this pop up in other places.\n\nWHAT IS AN ADVENT AND WHAT DO ITS CANDLES MEAN DURING THIS HOLY SEASON?\n\nAnd they've gotten introduced to the app and to a more deeply cultivated prayer life \u2014 and in some cases it's been absolutely transformative for people.\n\nSome people who've never been to church started going to church. Some people who haven't been to church for 20 years have come back to the church. People have converted \u2014 and all because they've fallen in love with the richness, the depth and the tradition of the Catholic Church.\n\nAnd obviously [the Hallow app] is authentically Catholic, but it is for all Christians \u2014 Christians of all denominations. There's something there for everybody, which is what makes the app so universally appealing.\n\n\u2018Simple act of surrender\u2019\n\nQuestion: You've described an experience earlier in your life in which you prayed about leaving all of your anxieties and worries aside, and instead trusted that God would take care of things \u2014 and then after that came the role of Jesus in \"The Chosen\" for you. Is there a larger message here for people, things that others might learn from your experience?\n\nRoumie: I think it all comes down to the simple act of surrender to God in a person's life. And I went through this in a very visceral, substantial and transformative way in my life five years ago.\n\nI literally was on my knees and I said, \"Jesus, I surrender myself to you. Take care of everything.\" And He did.\n\n\"It's a matter of tapping into [our] faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives \u2014 and surrendering is the first step to getting there\"\n\nAnd then three months later, I got called to do \"The Chosen.\" It was a point that I think my life was building to when that happened \u2014 and I realized that trying to micromanage God was not something that was working in my favor.\n\n'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'\n\nAnd once I let him take the wheel, everything changed. The decisive moment was that simple prayer of surrender.\n\nAnd I think that's really difficult for people, especially when we feel so out of control. When we turn on the news and see what's going on today, it feels like we have no control in our own lives.\n\nBut God hasn't forsaken us. He's not abandoned us. He's faithful to us to the very end. And it's a matter of tapping into that faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives \u2014 and surrendering is the first step to getting there.\n\nAnd then, to continue to cultivate that relationship through prayer \u2014 that's how we sustain that surrender.\n\nThe Hallow app and especially this Advent challenge is a beautiful way to kickstart that, especially if a person hasn't ever tried praying consistently before.\n\n\u2018So many options\u2019\n\nQuestion: For those who haven't used it yet, can you describe how the app is not a replacement for Scripture but actually offers robust access to the Bible?\n\nRoumie: I narrate most of the New Testament in the app, so you have access to the Bible here, through many works and passages of Scripture and through [other people] as well.\n\nAnd if you want something that's very specific, it is here. Plus, there are resources for mental health.\n\nThere is music.\n\nAnd for me as a musician, music is so transportive and nourishing for the spirit \u2014 to be able to listen to music that kind of gets you in the mindset for prayer and worship.\n\nThere are just so many options that people have that it's kind of mind-bending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nQuestion: How has playing the role of Jesus in \"The Chosen\" changed your life and changed you?\n\nRoumie: It's allowed me to go deeper into my own relationship with Him.\n\nIt's caused me to examine what exactly is my relationship with Him \u2014 and how can I go further in that relationship, how can I get close to Him, how can I grow deeper in communion with Him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo it's challenged me on that level.\n\nBut as it challenges me, it also allows me to go further in that relationship \u2014 and to deepen my prayer life."

    "body": "Erik ten Hag has disagreed with Jamie Carragher's comments that Manchester United are going backwards this season - by saying the statistics show that his team has actually improved.\n\nUnited host local rivals Manchester City in a Super Sunday derby this weekend, live on Sky Sports with kick-off at 3.30pm, in the latest acid test to see how far Ten Hag's side have improved from last season.\n\nIn his column in The Daily Telegraph, Carragher said United's summer signings have led to the club becoming \"stale\" - and that Ten Hag should now be questioned about whether he can get the best out of his squad.\n\nBut in his pre-match press conference for the City game, Ten Hag hit back at those claims.\n\n\"In possession we have to do better, but there are reasons and I don't go into them, but everyone is seeing why. But there are also facts so I disagree [with Carragher], we are much better,\" said Ten Hag.\n\n\"In high ball regains, we are a top of the Premier League. In the middle [of the pitch] ball regains, we are top. The pressing is very good. So that's not the truth, what he [Carragher] is telling.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player FREE TO WATCH: Highlights from Sheffield United\u2019s Premier League clash with Manchester United\n\nIn a fortnight where United have picked up three straight wins against Brentford, Sheffield United and FC Copenhagen, albeit via far from convincing performances, Christian Eriksen said United still need to find their \"balance and routines\" this season.\n\nAsked about those comments, Ten Hag said: \"We are in the right direction. We have a way to go. I see positives but I see negatives.\n\n\"What Christian is referring to is we are not consistently in possession on the level where we can be. Like Arsenal away, the first 30 minutes in Bayern Munich away. We should do this on a consistent basis.\n\n\"We don't take the benefit in the attacking transition moments, we should be because the ability in the team can take benefit from it. We pay attention to it, we need to grow. Then games will become easier.\"\n\nSo, what do the stats say?\n\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\n\nTen Hag is indeed right - Manchester United do rank very highly in their pressing stats in the final two-thirds of the pitch.\n\nUnited are, as he says, \"top of the Premier League\" in terms of possessions won in the final third and high turnovers. He is slightly wrong in terms of winning the ball in the middle third of the pitch - with United second behind Everton in that statistical table.\n\nHowever, there is still work to be done in terms of improving United's pressing. Their passing permitted per defensive actions (PPDA) tally ranks 10th - so, average - in the league. It shows that while Ten Hag's side do win the ball high up the pitch, opponents do tend to keep the ball as well as play it around United's pressing forwards as well.\n\nWhat is PPDA? PPDA is the number of opposition passes allowed outside of the pressing team's own defensive third, divided by the number of defensive actions by the pressing team outside of their own defensive third. A lower figure indicates a higher level of pressing, while a higher figure indicates a lower level of pressing.\n\nThe other pressing concern United have, which Ten Hag did reference in Friday's press conference, is finishing chances when they win the ball high up.\n\nUnited have the fourth-highest amounts of shots after winning the ball in their final third, but the glaring statistic is no goals from 104 high turnovers.\n\nAs expected, Manchester City have the highest amount of build-up attacks in the Premier League this season, so if United do win the ball high up in Sunday's derby, they need to start taking those chances.\n\nTen Hag on misfiring strikers: We need to be better\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag speaks on the improvement he's seen in goalkeeper Andre Onana and insists he believes Marcus Rashford can get back to scoring goals\n\nUnited go into Sunday's derby with a slight striker scoring problem. City forward Erling Haaland has scored more Premier League goals this season (9) than United's five forwards have managed in all competitions (8).\n\nUnited's top scorer this season is actually defensive midfielder Casemiro with four strikes so far.\n\nAsked if their forwards are to blame for this frontline problem, Ten Hag replied: \"Fault? It's co-operation. It has to click.\n\n\"We have shown in some games, we have so many in overload positions to the opponents goal and we don't net or don't even hit the target. We should be doing this better.\"\n\nIt has been a sobering start to the season for Marcus Rashford, who has one goal so far this term for United. But Ten Hag says he has full faith that the England forward, who scored 30 goals last season, can find his scoring boots again.\n\n\"If you give him the trust and I play him every game, most games also he finishes the game. I have strong belief he will return to scoring a lot of goals,\" said Ten Hag.\n\n\"It also has to do with the co-operation, with the movement around and the distribution to him. We have to work on that and that's my focus point.\""

From the world-famous Whistler Blackcomb and its attractive resort towns to the steep verticals of Revelstoke, there\u2019s enough choice \u2013 for every level of skier \u2013 to keep you coming back for years.\n\nFamilies, couples and groups alike can enjoy varied, all-round resorts like charming Tremblant, beginner-friendly family resorts such as Big White and expert areas like Fernie, with some of North America\u2019s steepest terrain, best runs and most challenging off-piste.\n\nSeveral of the resorts can be combined into one single trip too, offering exceptional variety and thousands of acres in areas of outstanding natural beauty, such as Banff National Park.\n\nAdd to this reliable snow cover and some of the longest ski seasons in the world and there\u2019s a compelling case for making your next ski trip to a Canadian resort. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up the best.\n\nWhistler Blackcomb\n\nWhistler is Canada\u2019s best-known resort (Getty Images)\n\nUndeniably Canada\u2019s most famed ski resort, Whistler Blackcomb has a legendary reputation as an excellent ski area for all levels of skier. The largest ski resort in North America, it is home to over 8,100 acres of skiable terrain and over 200 runs. Some 55 per cent of these are marked as intermediate runs, though there are great beginner areas at the base of Blackcomb and mid-way up Whistler. There are several excellent advanced areas too, including the Flute Bowl, West Bowl and Spankey\u2019s Ladder, with the longest runs offering a 1,500-metre vertical.\n\nThe town of Whistler was purpose-built and has quickly developed into one of the world\u2019s premier resorts. There are plenty of non-skiing activities available and several options for kids, while the apres is among some of the best in North America, centred around venues like Merlin\u2019s, Dusty\u2019s and BrewHouse.\n\nBook it\n\nHeidi offers packages to The Westin Resort & Spa, two minutes from the slopes and just over five away from the town centre. Inside, the rooms are spacious, modern and come with excellent views which are only beaten by those offered from the terrace and grill restaurant.\n\nFrom \u00a33,073pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Vancouver and airport transfers. Departing 13 January 2024.\n\nRead more on ski holidays:\n\nTremblant\n\nTremblant is Quebec\u2019s premier resort (Getty Images)\n\nQuebec\u2019s premier ski resort sits at the foot of the eponymous mountain, whose pistes cater well to all abilities. Beginners can start their ski journey at the edge of the village before progressing onto a series of long greens, including the Flying Mile. There are a number blues for intermediates, especially in the areas around Le Soleil and the Lowell Thomas lift, while advanced skiers can enjoy several terrain parks and steep black runs on both the north and south side of the mountain.\n\nThe idyllic, purpose-built village has been deliberately built in the style of Old Quebec, with plenty of colourful facades and French-Canadian charm. It offers lively apres and nightlife, often bolstered when locals flock in from Montreal. Non-skiing activities include ice skating, ice fishing and long walking trails, plus there\u2019s a village casino.\n\nBook it\n\nBritish Airways Holidays has trips to the Fairmont Tremblant, one of the more grand hotels in the resort, with an excellent ski-in/ski-out location that lies just a few metres from the lifts. The hotel has impressive spa, pool and sauna facilities, along with a large terrace, restaurant and outdoor hot tub.\n\nFrom \u00a31,329pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Montreal and airport transfers. Departing 20 January 2024.\n\nSunshine Village\n\nSunshine Village is one of three ski resorts in the Banff National Park (Getty Images)\n\nSunshine Village lies around 20 minutes away from the town of Banff, with over 3,000 acres of ski area that is famed for its snow quality and reliable coverage, reflected in its long season that typically runs from mid-November to late May. It is another all-round area that caters almost equally to every level of skier, starting at the greens on the slopes of Mount Standish. Intermediates are at home in the areas served by the Continental Divide lift and the Tee Pee Town Express, while the more advanced should make a beeline for Goats Eye Mountain. The off-piste at Delirium Dive is also noteworthy.\n\nBanff is the place to stay for livelier evenings and decent accessibility, though due to the town\u2019s distance from the ski area, there is less of an \u2018apres\u2019 culture on the slopes.\n\nBook it\n\nStay at the newest hotel in Banff with a package from Inghams. The four-star Moose Hotel & Suites sits in the downtown area, offering comfortable rooms \u2013 with balcony or patio areas that provide great views of the Rockies \u2013 and a spa that features two heated rooftop pools that remain open in winter. You\u2019ll be a short shuttle away from Sunshine Village, or it\u2019s a 40-minute journey over to neighbouring Lake Louise.\n\nFrom \u00a31,482pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Calgary and transfers. Departing 27 January 2024.\n\nFernie\n\nFernie is paradise for more advanced skiers and snowboarders (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThough a little smaller than some rivals at 2,500 acres, Fernie has gained a reputation as an excellent area for advanced skiers, with the added bonus of an average of nine metres of snowfall annually. The mountain is divided into seven sections, the lowest of which offers groomed green slopes for beginners, but the real attraction in Fernie is the ungroomed, steep terrain and tree skiing.\n\nThe most challenging runs are at Polar Peak and Currie Bowl, with tree skiing at Siberia or Timber Bowl. The runs around the Timber Bowl Express are more open and longer, with a 650-metre vertical.\n\nWhen picking accommodation, beware that Fernie\u2019s resort village, while convenient, is fairly small and quiet. The town of Fernie itself is far more lively and has good bus links to the resort five miles away.\n\nBook it\n\nWelcome in the New Year in style with a stay in Fernie courtesy of Ski Solutions. Mark the celebrations at Lizard Creek Lodge, a ski-in/ski-out hotel where the views from the terrace and balconies are only rivalled by those on the slopes. Head into town in the evenings in a rental car, included in the package price.\n\nFrom \u00a31,795pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from a London airport, airport transfers and car hire. Departing 30 December 2023.\n\nBig White\n\nBig White offers great tree runs (Getty Images)\n\nBig White is one of the best choices in the country for beginners, intermediates and those looking to learn to ski powder, with less steep terrain and plenty of shelter and tree runs. Located in the Okanagan Highlands, this 2,800-acre resort was purpose built for ski-in/ski-out access, providing easy access to the slopes from most of the accommodation.\n\nSome 18 per cent of its 119 runs designated as beginner, while intermediates have the pick of the slopes, with over 50 per cent catering to them. Though the resort is less advanced-friendly, there are challenging areas out in the open at the top of the mountain.\n\nMarketed as \u2018Canada\u2019s favourite family resort\u2019, Big White is also a great destination for a ski holiday with the kids. The \u2018Happy Valley\u2019 area at the bottom of the village provides several non-skiing activities, and there are enough good restaurants to fill your stay if needed.\n\nBook it\n\nSki Safari offers February half-term getaways to Big White with a stay at the aptly named Chateau Big White in the centre of town. Close to the slopes and with convenient ski-in/ski-out access, it has the ideal location for exploring both the pistes and the local area. Guests can sample food at the on-site Swiss Bear restaurant or the Black Diamond Bar & Grill.\n\nPrices for two adults and two children under 12 years from \u00a31,280pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights and transfers. Flights are arranged and quoted upon enquiry. Departing 10 February 2024.\n\nLake Louise\n\nLake Louise is the largest of the resorts in Banff National Park (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nLake Louise lies a little further away from Banff than Sunshine Village, but offers a larger ski area and some of the most amazing views in Banff National Park, including that of the famed Mount Assiniboine. Beginners will find the area around the foot of the hill a good start, while the area around the Grizzly Express and Larch Express lifts contains good beginner runs and some top-to-bottom greens. Much of the rest suits intermediates, while the Back Bowls are good for the more advanced.\n\nMost people will choose to base themselves in Banff, though the 45-minute drive to Lake Louise may put some off. A lift pass to the \u2018Ski Big 3\u2019 area covers Lake Louise, Sunshine Village and nearby Mount Norquay, but a stay in Lake Louise itself is a great option for a relaxing week split between skiing, the odd visit to Banff and seeing what this charming village has to offer.\n\nBook it\n\nAnother offering from Fairmont is the magnificent Chateau Lake Louise, a historic hotel located right next to the shores of the lake itself. Crystal Ski offers the most affordable package here, with a stay in an elegant double room that boasts delightful views of the Rockies. You\u2019ll be five minutes away from town, with the ski area accessible using a free, 10-minute shuttle bus.\n\nFrom \u00a31,904pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Calgary and transfers. Departing 27 January 2024.\n\nRevelstoke\n\nRevelstoke is one of Canada\u2019s newest resorts (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nRevelstoke has managed to gain a glowing reputation despite existing for much less time than most of its rivals (it opened in 2007). Another resort that is well-known for the quality and quantity of its snow, it is still a work in progress \u2013 you can currently explore around 3,000 of the intended 8,000 acres \u2013 but is already a highly regarded destination for those of an intermediate level or higher.\n\nMount Mackenzie possesses everything from well-groomed, long blues like the 4km Snow Rodeo to steep open terrain or tree-skiing around the North and South Bowls, with a vertical of 1,700 metres that is the longest on the continent. Heli-skiing is also popular in Revelstoke, opening up access to 500,000 acres and 400 runs.\n\nBook it\n\nBook a stay at The Sutton Place hotel with Ski Safari. A refreshing blend of alpine facades and modern American interiors, it has large suites and impressive facilities including indoor and outdoor pools and three restaurants. Even better, it sits less than 50 metres from one of the main gondolas for easy access to the slopes.\n\nFrom \u00a32,455pp, including 10 nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights and airport transfers. Flights are arranged and quoted upon enquiry. Departing 15 January 2024.\n\nRead our reviews of the best Canada hotels"

    "body": "The best deals of the year were once known to occur during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which in 2023 take place on Friday, Nov. 24, and Monday, Nov. 27, respectively. Not anymore!\n\nIn 2023, the best Black Friday deals kicked off on Nov. 17 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and other retailers. Instead of hosting all of the doorbuster deals on one day right after Thanksgiving, retailers see the value in maximizing the amount of time you have to shop for products before Black Friday. And I\u2019ve gotta say, it\u2019s quite nice to not feel rushed while shopping.\n\nIn addition to presenting you with the best board game deals and price drops on gaming monitors, plus deals on SSDs and microSD cards, there are some bits of info and wisdom I\u2019ve organized into sections below that might help you feel more informed as you begin to shop for the holidays.\n\nRetailer memberships will pay for themselves (eventually)\n\nTo get early access to Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals \u2014 or to get access at all \u2014 some retailers offer memberships. Most are familiar with Amazon Prime, which offers a free 30-day trial and unlocks special prices on top of free shipping and other perks, but there are others. Costco is another popular example that\u2019s been around for a while. Its $60 membership pays for itself quickly with holiday purchases, especially if you buy food products in bulk (this is outside of Polygon\u2019s purview, but you cannot beat its deal on Kerrygold butter).\n\nWalmart Plus costs $99 per year ($50 for a limited time), and serves as a ticket to get in on deals before other Walmart shoppers, plus other perks. Note: You won\u2019t get early access to deals with its free 30-day trial; you must be a paid member to earn access, so hit \u201cSkip trial for Early Access\u201d when signing up.\n\nThen you have Best Buy\u2019s My Best Buy Plus and Total memberships, costing $49.99 and $179.99, respectively. As for what each offers, check out Best Buy\u2019s page that spells it all out. This page details all of the exclusive deals, which can help you quickly recoup the cost of the membership.\n\nAmazon Prime members get free games and DLC all year\n\nAmazon offers freebies for Prime members \u2019round the calendar year, not just during the holiday months. Those offerings expire over time and new ones are added, and Amazon\u2019s suite of giveaways has improved over time.\n\nWe collect all of the latest free games and DLC that Amazon is giving away right here. To give you a taste, Rage 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Doom 3 are some of what\u2019s up for grabs right now.\n\nYou\u2019ll get price matching if you shop at the right time\n\nSome major retailers are ensuring price protection on purchases right now.\n\nAmazon does not price match, which is annoying, but it\u2019s tolerable since it often has the lowest prices of all retailers anyway. Amazon only protects the price on pre-orders that have its \u201cPre-order Price Guarantee,\u201d which ensures that you\u2019ll pay the lowest amount a product sells for before it\u2019s launched.\n\nNot only does Best Buy match prices from \u201cqualified competitors,\u201d but its site says that most products bought between now and Dec. 30 can be price-matched through Jan. 13, 2024.\n\nWalmart\u2019s policy says it won\u2019t price match with competitors, nor does it price match for products purchased online that later decrease in price.\n\nTarget says that purchases made between Oct. 22 and Dec. 24 can be price-adjusted if the cost lowers in the span of time, and if you show proof of purchase. You may be eligible for a price match on a purchase, but the rules for submitting documentation vary depending on whether you\u2019re shopping online or in store. It\u2019s all explained here.\n\nMost Black Friday return policies extend through January 2024\n\nAccording to Best Buy, certain products bought now (dating back to Oct. 27) until Dec. 30 may be returned before Jan. 13.\n\nTarget will accept most unopened items in new condition within 90 days of purchase.\n\nWalmart has an extended holiday return policy in effect that allows items purchased between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 to be returned on or before Jan. 31, 2024.\n\nAmazon\u2019s extended return policy is in effect for most items that are purchased between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31. Those items can be returned before Jan. 31, 2024. However, Apple-brand products purchased in that time frame can only be returned on or before Jan. 15, 2024.\n\nBlack Friday likely won\u2019t be your last opportunity to save\n\nThere will be amazing deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday on everything, from tabletop and board games to toys, video games, and more. However, it likely won\u2019t be the last opportunity for you to save. As someone who\u2019s been covering deals for The Verge and Polygon for years, I\u2019m shocked by how often I see these low prices, often spoken of as if they\u2019re a flash in the pan, extending through much of December. That said, it\u2019s more likely that price cuts on products you want can go by unnoticed unless you\u2019re tracking deals yourself.\n\nTrack deals yourself\n\nWe love to tell you about great deals. But there\u2019s a limit to the kind of products that we write about, and the ones that we see. If you\u2019re not comfortable leaving it up to the chance that we\u2019re going to tell you about price cuts on the products you really want, you have the power to track deals with relative ease.\n\nIf you only shop on Amazon, CamelCamelCamel remains one of the best tools for tracking price changes and history for products. While you don\u2019t need an account to see pricing information available through the app, making a profile will allow you to set up watchlists and get email price alerts for your favorite products. You\u2019re welcome to manually populate your own watchlist, but the app also allows you to import any existing Amazon wishlist into your CamelCamelCamel profile. Make sure to grab its Camelizer browser extension, too.\n\nHoney and its accompanying extension allow you to track pricing history changes on specific products, but across a number of retailers, not just Amazon. Also, as an added bonus, Honey will also automatically search for promo codes when you check out at a supported retailer."

    "body": "Black Friday and Cyber Monday may be in the past, but some sales are still hanging around (although maybe not for long). For more leftover deals we recommend across all categories, be sure to check out the rest of the Cyber Monday still available here.\n\nEvery month or so, we like to ask our staff about their favorite stuff \u2014 whether it\u2019s pet toys, travel aids, kitchen gadgets, or straightforward tech. And the results are usually very different, very interesting, and a lot of fun.\n\nIn celebration of the annual post-Thanksgiving sales, we looked through some of our recent \u201cfavorites\u201d articles and found deals on a lot of the tech, kitchen tools, travel aids, and pet toys we like. We thought we\u2019d list a few in case you\u2019ve read about them in the past and thought, \u201cWell, that sort of sounds good, but it\u2019s a bit pricey.\u201d (Or, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cheap, but maybe I\u2019ll wait until the price goes down some more...\u201d)\n\nSo here are some of our staff\u2019s most-liked gear and gadgets, much of which is still discounted from Cyber Monday.\n\nTech tools\n\nElectronics repair kit\n\nAlex Cranz, managing editor\n\nTekton Everybit Tech Rescue Kit $ 22 $ 29 24 % off $ 22 $ 22 $ 29 24 % off A 46-piece screwdriver kit that can help you repair practically any tech device out there. $22 at Amazon\n\nI own at least two of these little Tekton Everybit Tech Rescue Kits, and I frequently buy them for friends and family, too. For an average price of $35, you get a screwdriver with nearly every bit you\u2019d need for most gadgets (including the weird ones for Apple products), a plastic and a metal spudger, tweezers, and a suction cup. I\u2019ve replaced batteries in iPhones with this kit. I\u2019ve built entire PCs with this kit. I\u2019ve swapped out backplates on Steam Decks and housings of Joy-Con controllers with one of these kits. I\u2019ve even used it to repair my eyeglasses.\n\nOne of the best parts of the kit is it all goes in a single case that can be tossed in a computer bag or purse or be left in a desk drawer at the office. But honestly, the main reason I love it is the selection and quality of the bits. Too often, precision screwdrivers have super soft bits that strip the first time you use them with a screw that\u2019s been tightened by a machine. Given that most gadgets have at least one too-tight screw, I\u2019ve gone through quite a few cheap screwdriver kits before I settled on this one. While I\u2019m slowly building out a high-quality selection of precision screwdrivers, most people don\u2019t have that luxury or necessity. This is a great alternative \u2014 plus, you feel like kind of a badass when someone asks you to help fix a gadget, and you just pull this kit out of your bag in the middle of Starbucks and get to work.\n\nSafety cutter\n\nEmilia David, reporter\n\nI admit TikTok made me buy this small safety cutter, but it\u2019s been indispensable to someone who may or may not have an online shopping addiction. The Slice Micro Ceramic Blade safety cutter\u2019s tiny blade cuts through paper packaging tape cleanly, opens plastic wrapping, and keeps me from going insane opening blister packaging. It doesn\u2019t damage whatever is inside, which unfortunately happens very often with my regular metal box cutter.\n\nThe downside is that it\u2019s so small you may lose track of it if not in use, but it does have a built-in magnet and a handy dandy hole for a keyring. And while it doesn\u2019t fully slice through a cardboard box, it will still leave a scratch, although that could ultimately damage the ceramic blade if not used properly. I\u2019ve had my Slice Micro for a few months, so I\u2019m not worried about it dulling yet, but it is unclear if the blade is replaceable.\n\nHeadphone hanger\n\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\n\nAnchor Pro under-desk headphone hanger $ 12 $ 15 20 % off $ 12 $ 12 $ 15 20 % off An under-desk dual headphone hanger that uses 3M adhesive for mounting and an included Velcro strap to anchor a headphone cable. $12 at Amazon\n\nI gave this a try for one of our TikTok videos, and it has not disappointed me yet. I use it to hold my Razer Kraken headset and some extra cords. It\u2019s small enough to remain out of the way but large enough to hold more than the headset itself. It has a pretty strong hold and doesn\u2019t give, even as I raise my standing desk up and down several times a day. It\u2019s not the prettiest accessory one can attach to their desk, but it is highly functional.\n\nCharging station\n\nJess Weatherbed, news writer\n\nI got this as a birthday present from my partner after several months of arguing over our sleeping arrangements. Something about me trailing the charging cables for my devices in the bed being \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cextremely uncomfortable.\u201d Anyway, after begrudgingly acknowledging my poor charging habits, I have to admit that having this on my desk has had benefits outside of not garroting myself mid-slumber.\n\nMy iPhone, Apple Watch, and wireless earbuds rarely run out of juice, as I no longer fall asleep before plugging them in. I\u2019ve also taken to using the charger\u2019s upright positioning for phones to my advantage \u2014 serving as a desk clock, a tiny display for Slack or Discord, and as a hub to remotely control the various smart devices around my home. It helps me separate the device from being my phone and instead helps me build the habit of it being another tool to boost my productivity.\n\nHelp for the cook\n\nA multipurpose rice cooker\n\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\n\nZojirushi Micom Rice Cooker and Warmer $ 194 $ 233 17 % off $ 194 $ 194 $ 233 17 % off A 5.5-cup-capacity rice cooker and warmer that not only cooks rice but also comes with a steaming basket to double as a steamer and a cake menu setting to bake cakes. $194 at Amazon\n\nA lot of people will tell you that rice cookers are single-use appliances meant only for rice \u2014 they\u2019re wrong. A rice cooker is best at cooking rice, but it can do a lot of the same things as an Instant Pot. For instance, you can use it to cook hardboiled eggs or oatmeal, steam vegetables, make porridge, make one-pot meals, and even bake a cake.\n\nI grew up with giant 10-cup rice cookers at home, but I didn\u2019t appreciate how versatile this appliance was until I left the country for college. A tiny two-cup rice cooker kept me fed in my cramped 250-square-foot Tokyo apartment. It was programmable, so I could wash my rice, stick it in the cooker, and know that when I woke up late for class, I could still whip up some ochazuke or oatmeal for a quick, cheap, and nutritious breakfast. (It also took the hassle out of steel-cut oats.) Whenever I had a craving for sweets, it was so easy to take pancake mix and bake a Japanese-style cheesecake for one.\n\nI\u2019ve since graduated to a 5.5-cup Zojirushi Micom Rice Cooker, and it\u2019s one of the handiest tools I have for meal prepping. When I was sick this past winter, I made ample use of its porridge setting to make a congee-type dish with chicken and ginger \u2014 just like my mom used to make when I was a kid. The fact that it\u2019ll keep something warm for days, meant I could crawl out of bed, scoop out some porridge, and crawl back into bed with minimal effort. When I\u2019m feeling lazy, I throw eggs in there, and bam \u2014 some extra hard-boiled protein. Mine also comes with a little basket, so it\u2019s super easy to throw in veggies or steam frozen dumplings.\n\nBut what I like most is that rice cookers are more space-efficient than Instant Pots. In my kitchen, the one spot where I could fit an Instant Pot is instead occupied by a rice cooker, blender, and spoon rest. A multitasking kitchen gadget that doesn\u2019t take over your entire counter? That\u2019s a must if you live in a small space.\n\nOld-fashioned toaster oven\n\nAmelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor\n\nI love a toaster oven! It\u2019s compact, works fast, and is perfect for reheating pizza, making nachos, and yes, even toast. I use my toaster oven more than my regular oven for sure \u2014 and probably more than any other item in my kitchen. I have a pretty basic model like this one, but these days, many come with other features, like air frying and convection oven capabilities.\n\nSeal in your fresh food\n\nEmma Roth, news writer\n\nFoodSaver vacuum sealer machine $ 147 $ 220 33 % off $ 147 $ 147 $ 220 33 % off Keep food fresh by squeezing all the air out of the package and sealing it for long- or short-term storage. $147 at Amazon\n\nI never knew how much I needed a vacuum sealer until I actually got one. I\u2019m the type of person who shops at wholesale clubs despite only needing food for two people, so when I buy meat, I get a lot of it all at once, some of which inevitably gets stored in my fridge or freezer. That\u2019s where my vacuum sealer comes in.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t speak to the quality of other vacuum sealers, the FoodSaver I have is awesome. Not only does the thing help keep raw meat and other food fresher for longer in the fridge, but it also helps save space in the freezer (each package of meat becomes much flatter when all the air is sucked out of it). With this little machine, I can load up whatever I want in one of the FoodSaver bags, insert the open end into the machine, which vacuums up all the air and then closes the bag using its heat sealing feature in one fell swoop. It\u2019s pretty neat!\n\nFor the traveler\n\nCarry-on backpack\n\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\n\nEarlier this year, I committed to traveling more, and so I took a look at the gear I had that could be replaced after years of trekking the globe. My ratty old secondhand carry-on bag was the first thing to be replaced. After several days of weighing the pros and cons of various travel bags, I stumbled upon this Lumesner carry-on backpack on Amazon, and it fit all of my needs. It can carry a laptop, several days\u2019 worth of clothes, my 40oz Hydro Flask bottle, and more. The bag even includes some packing cubes. It\u2019s very comfortable, and the weight is well distributed when it\u2019s completely full. It\u2019s an inexpensive alternative to many name-brand carry-on bags, too. So far, I\u2019ve used it on a handful of trips, and the quality has held up. It also holds onto pet fur, though, so I had to add a small lint roller to my travel necessities. But that\u2019s just life while traveling with a dog anyway.\n\nAn extension cord for awkward situations\n\nSarah Jeong, deputy features editor\n\nAnker 321 Power Strip $ 15 $ 26 42 % off $ 15 $ 15 $ 26 42 % off This all-in-one 20W USB-C power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port. $15 at Amazon\n\nNobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It\u2019s probably unnecessary if you\u2019re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you\u2019re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it\u2019s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there\u2019s already two lamps plugged into it.\n\nOlder buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they\u2019re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord / power strip. It\u2019s not a full power strip \u2014 just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I\u2019ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.\n\nThe three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people\u2019s devices.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling overseas, don\u2019t forget to purchase a different plug type for the region you\u2019re going to or pack an adapter.\n\nA portable smart speaker\n\nBrandon Widder, senior commerce editor\n\nSonos Roam $ 134 $ 180 26 % off $ 134 $ 134 $ 180 26 % off The Sonos Roam is a truly portable Sonos speaker with a rugged design that\u2019s built to withstand the elements. It also features wireless charging and supports AirPlay 2, Alexa, and Google Assistant. $134 at Best Buy$134 at Sonos\n\nFor the longest time, my go-to portable speaker for camping and backpacking was the Ultimate Ears Roll 2. It was small and efficient, but it didn\u2019t mesh well with the rest of my audio setup, especially on those sweltering summer days when I barely made it beyond the confines of my own backyard.\n\nA couple of years ago, however, I splurged on the Sonos Roam. The rugged, pint-sized device is on the pricier side when compared to other Bluetooth speakers, but it produces solid sound for the size, offers wireless charging, and can automatically jump between my home Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth, a convenience I\u2019ve come to appreciate when strapping the speaker to my bike and heading out the door.\n\nAnd while I might not be able to fire off my usual quips at Alexa when I take it into the backcountry \u2014 the Roam only supports voice commands when connected to Wi-Fi \u2014 I certainly can still do it poolside with a drink in hand.\n\nUniversal travel adapter\n\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\n\nEpicka universal travel adapter $ 20 $ 25 20 % off $ 20 $ 20 $ 25 20 % off Epicka\u2019s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries. $20 at Amazon\n\nIn my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you\u2019ve landed in another country isn\u2019t always easy, either. And if you\u2019re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don\u2019t always have more than one plug for your American devices \u2014 in which case, you\u2019ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s six plug adaptors in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it\u2019s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you\u2019ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it\u2019s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.\n\nThe only caveat is that, although it says \u201cuniversal,\u201d it\u2019s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That\u2019ll get you by in most countries, but it\u2019s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I\u2019ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store.\n\nLovely lights\n\nBrandon Widder, senior commerce editor\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of ambient lighting, even when I\u2019m 50 miles from the nearest outlet. And while I\u2019ve long been a proponent of MPOWERD\u2019s solar-powered Luci lanterns, I recently picked up the company\u2019s like-minded string lights for car camping and overnight jaunts in the backcountry when I don\u2019t mind toting a little extra weight with me.\n\nThe 18-foot string is certainly not the brightest you can buy \u2014 it packs a series of 100-lumen LEDs, whereas your average headlamp might offer 400 \u2014 but it can swap between six different colors and features a 2,000mAh battery for when your phone needs some emergency juice. Best of all, you can charge the lights via USB or solar, meaning you can spend less time worrying about how to keep them going and more time taking in the vibes.\n\nMemory card holder and reader\n\nBecca Farsace, senior producer\n\nAs a video person who is constantly on the move, there is nothing better than the consolidation of gear \u2014 especially when it pertains to dongles. So when fellow video extraordinaire Vjeran Pavic (The Verge\u2019s supervising producer) recently surprised me with a very cute birthday note and this magical little gadget, I was elated.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, it has a carabiner hook. It is everything I have ever wanted in a rubber case and more. To have both my SD card reader and all my cards in one place is priceless (well, actually $39.95). Thank you, Vjeran. <3\n\nA mobile tripod for holiday snaps\n\nJess Weatherbed, news writer\n\nWhen you go on holiday with your partner or family, you generally get stuck with three options when it comes to taking group photographs: a cramped selfie, leaving someone out to take the picture, or asking a total stranger to take it for you. Not to be dramatic or anything, but I\u2019d rather not ruin my vacation by trying to figure out which individuals nearby are the least likely to dip the minute I hand over my phone. And it\u2019s depressing to think that my mum is in so few of our family photos because she was always the person on the other side of the camera.\n\nA decent Bluetooth-enabled tripod can resolve these issues. I\u2019ve had good experiences using Atumtek\u2019s 60-inch Self-Stick Tripod \u2014 it features a discreet, detachable Bluetooth shutter remote that you can pair with your smartphone, sparing you from having to set a timer and run like hell. Simply get into position and use the remote to snap as many shots as you need to ensure it\u2019s caught you at a flattering angle. It also extends up to 60 inches to squeeze everyone into a group selfie if you\u2019re using it as a selfie stick. This could be a brilliant gift for any \u201cInstagram boyfriends\u201d who spend hours of their vacations as their partner\u2019s dedicated paparazzi.\n\nA car-friendly charger\n\nSean Hollister, senior editor\n\nMaybe someday Apple will realize that it wasn\u2019t the brightest idea to artificially limit the reach of its MagSafe charging ecosystem and you\u2019ll be able to plop your phone on a magical minimalist disc that charges it at high speeds. In the meanwhile, a standard Qi charger is about the best you\u2019ll get \u2014 and the bulky but practical iOttie Easy One Touch Qi does it with the satisfying snap of springs. When you push your phone into its waiting jaws, it depresses a button that causes those jaws to firmly snap closed on either side of your device. When you want to remove it, you pinch a pair of levers with your finger and thumb to release as you grab your slab. It\u2019s wide enough to fit practically anything on the market, save an opened Samsung Z Fold. I\u2019ve used one for years with Android and Apple phones alike, including newer MagSafe handsets.\n\nA colorful fanny pack\n\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\n\nI\u2019ve always been stymied by the need for a bag smaller than a backpack or knapsack but larger than a dinky clutch. I was wary of the whole \u201cwear a fanny pack as a mini crossbody bag\u201d trend, but earlier this summer, I caved and bought the Baboon to the Moon 3L Fannypack.\n\nNow, I cannot go back. This bag easily fits my wallet, phone, house keys, car keys, hand sanitizer, and chapstick \u2014 everything I need when I take walks or run errands. It\u2019s also got a quick-release buckle, so I can stick a carabiner on it and schlepp around a water bottle on hot days. The material is also incredibly durable, spill-proof, and easy to clean. The inside has some dividers but nothing too complicated.\n\nBut what I probably like most about this fanny pack (and this brand in general) is how colorful their bags are. I got one in lavender, stuck some enamel pins on it, and now there\u2019s absolutely no mistaking this is mine. I can see it easily from a distance, which also makes it harder to lose. The mix between colorful whimsy and practical functionality is something I wish I saw more often. All I\u2019m saying is that two of my friends went out and bought the same bag in different colors as soon as they saw me wearing it. And we\u2019re all immensely happy with our purchases.\n\nProducts for your pet\n\nHair remover\n\nMitchell Clark, former news writer\n\nChomChom pet hair remover $ 25 $ 32 22 % off $ 25 $ 25 $ 32 22 % off The ChomChom is a reusable cat and dog hair remover that works great for furniture.\n\n$25 at Amazon\n\nThe ChomChom pet hair remover is an extraordinarily simple device \u2014 it\u2019s basically a couple of pieces of plastic, fabric, and rubber. But through some dark magic, it\u2019s better at getting cat hair off my couch, cat tree, and other upholstery than even the adhesive-laden lint rollers (though those are still superior if the thing you\u2019re trying to de-pet is yourself). I\u2019d explain more, but honestly, I think the ChomChom can best be explained with this GIF:\n\nChomChom pet hair remover. GIF by Mitchell Clark / The Verge\n\nI know I\u2019m stretching the definition of \u201ctech\u201d here, but I just had to share the ChomChom because the first time I saw someone use it, my jaw dropped. I hope it can change your life like it did mine. (Note: as far as I can tell, the limited-edition cat ChomChom that I paid extra for is 0 percent more functional than the regular one. It was still worth it, though.)\n\nFuzzy cat bed\n\nElizabeth Lopatto, senior reporter\n\nJeeves loves to be in the office with me while I work. (I assume she\u2019s supervising.) Anyway, to make her cozier, I got her this fuzzy cat bed. At first, she was afraid of it \u2014 she\u2019s extremely shy around new people and objects \u2014 but now, a year later, it\u2019s her favorite place to sit that isn\u2019t my lap. Usually, she spends the afternoon snuggled up in it.\n\nDistracting dog toy\n\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\n\nTrudee, otherwise known as My Boss, is notoriously insistent on being the focus of my attention. At any given moment, she has 20 toys strewn about my apartment, but she will not play with them unless I\u2019m watching her \u2014 like literally, no distractions, sitting within feet of her, just staring at her chew on her toys for hours on end.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love staring at my dog, but she doesn\u2019t get the enrichment she deserves when her activity levels are tied directly to my ability to give her undivided attention. That is, until I bought the Pet Fit For Life Plush Wand. It has a toy attached to a long chewable rope that is suspended from a metal pole. Now, I not only toss the toy about the room from the comfort of my couch but also Trudee is so distracted by chasing it that she doesn\u2019t notice if I am not making direct eye contact. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\nVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

    "body": "A Pittsburgh boy with a rare liver disease is fighting for his life \u2014 and his family is hoping for a second miracle to save him.\n\nLucas Goeller, now 10, was born with a rare, life-threatening condition called biliary atresia, which is a blockage that prevents bile from traveling from the liver to the gallbladder.\n\nEight years after he received his first transplant as a toddler, his transplanted organ is now failing again \u2014 and his life depends on receiving another donation.\n\nONE FAMILY DONATES FOUR KIDNEYS TO SAVE A NEW YORK MAN\u2019S LIFE: \u2018DEFIED ALL ODDS\u2019\n\nIn 2015, when he was just a toddler, the child's health declined rapidly.\n\nHe spent 18 months on the liver transplant list, getting sicker each week, and did not receive a single organ donation offer.\n\n\"He was on the brink of death, unable to walk or talk,\" said his mother, Jessica Goeller, in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\" God told me to start a Facebook page for him, and at the time I really wasn't into social media.\"\n\nThat page led to a viral national campaign \u2014 complete with local news stories and donated billboards \u2014 that attracted the attention of a Nebraska family.\n\nARKANSAS MILITARY VETERAN RECEIVES WORLD\u2019S FIRST WHOLE-EYE AND PARTIAL-FACE TRANSPLANT\n\nAnd in July of that year, at UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, little 2-year-old Lucas received the liver of 3-year-old Olivia Swedberg, who had passed away a day earlier of brain cancer .\n\n\"I'm in awe when someone can take their suffering and turn it into something beautiful by donating and giving someone a second chance,\" said Goeller.\n\nAfter that first transplant, her young son made a \"miraculous recovery,\" Goeller said.\n\nnext Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nFor \"eight beautiful years,\" Goeller said, Lucas experienced a normal life as a happy, healthy boy .\n\n\"He was able to do things that he never could do before,\" she said. \"He went from watching out of windows to being an active participant in life.\"\n\n\"I'm in awe when someone can take their suffering and turn it into something beautiful by donating and giving someone a second chance.\"\n\nBut all of that changed this year, when his routine medical scans and blood work indicated that his liver had begun to fail.\n\n\"His failing liver is affecting his lung function and his ammonia levels,\" Goeller told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"That would be drastic for anyone, but for a child who's growing and cognitively developing, it is devastating to [his] development.\"\n\nDr. George Mazariegos, chief of pediatric transplantation at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said Lucas is experiencing some of the more subtle changes of liver failure.\n\nPIG HEART RECIPIENT'S \u2018LAST WISH\u2019 WAS TO HELP DOCTORS LEARN FROM PROCEDURE, DYING MAN SAID: \u2018WE WILL MISS HIM'\n\n\"Those include not being able to grow normally and not getting the proper levels of oxygen to his body and brain, because the blood is being shunted away from the liver,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Those are important and potentially life-threatening complications.\"\n\nAs of now, Lucas is still at home and \"managing his symptoms,\" Mazeriegos said, but the doctor emphasized the importance of his receiving a timely transplant before further complications occur.\n\nnext Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Goellers are now seeking support again, launching the \"Save Lucas\" campaign across social media.\n\nAnd the city of Pittsburgh has rallied once more behind the family, with newly donated billboards and media campaigns.\n\n\"We're trying to not only save Lucas, but also to build organ donation awareness for both deceased and living donors,\" said Goeller.\n\nULTIMATE FATHER\u2019S DAY GIFT: SON DONATES KIDNEY TO SAVE HIS DAD\u2019S LIFE\n\n\"We want it to really sink into hearts around the world because it's so important.\"\n\nDespite his challenges, young Lucas Goeller remains positive, active and upbeat, continuing to enjoy his love of the outdoors and hunting with his father and his three brothers, aged 12, 8, and 4.\n\n\"He's always filled with so much joy,\" his mother said. \"We get our strength from him. He encourages all of us to continue to look at the positives in life.\"\n\nThe ideal living donor for Lucas is someone with type O blood, aged 20 to 49, with a BMI below 30.\n\nChallenges facing pediatric transplants\n\nBeyond seeking a liver for their son, the Goellers are looking to raise awareness about the critical need for donors to help the more than 100,000 individuals on the organ donor list.\n\nChildren on transplant lists in the U.S. face three key challenges, Mazariegos said.\n\nTINA TURNER SUFFERED FROM KIDNEY DISEASE BEFORE HER DEATH: 'I HAVE PUT MYSELF IN GREAT DANGER'\n\n\"First, there is a great demand for life-saving transplants, and there are 10 times the number of adults on the liver transplant list as there are children,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"This creates a challenge to allocate the right or the best organ for the children who are waiting on the list.\"\n\nWhile Mazariegos noted that the allocation policy is slowly improving, it's still imperfect and doesn't always prioritize children appropriately.\n\nEach year, dozens of children in the U.S. die while awaiting a new liver.\n\nMazariegos is determined to eliminate this \"wait list mortality\" through the use of partial liver transplants. That's when either a living or deceased donor\u2019s liver is donated to two different recipients.\n\n\"Saving lives is not about competition \u2014 it\u2019s about collaboration.\"\n\nAnother challenge is that not all the centers in the country have the capacity to perform highly complex transplants like the one Lucas needs.\n\n\"We need to train centers across the country on the techniques that will allow them to transplant these children,\" Mazariegos said.\n\nBoth the Goeller family and the UPMC doctors stressed the importance of raising organ donor awareness so that more families register as organ donors.\n\nMazariegos noted that people need to be made aware of living donation, which is when donors give part of their liver to a recipient.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nIn 2018, UPMC started a learning network, the Starzl Network for Excellence in Pediatric Transplantation, in honor of Dr. Thomas Starzl, who is recognized as the father of transplantation.\n\n\"This is an effort to level the playing field and extend the expertise to centers that want to provide the same level of care their patients deserve.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania alone , 18 children are waiting for liver transplants, while 300 children are on the list nationwide, Goeller pointed out.\n\n\"Life-saving donation is only possible through somebody else's love,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe said she hopes \"this campaign will inspire others to keep the conversation going and keep talking about Lucas and about other children and adults who need transplants.\"\n\nShe added, \"Saving lives is not about competition \u2014 it\u2019s about collaboration. It\u2019s going to take more than a village to get this message across the entire world.\""

Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nWe're into day two of Amazon's latest storewide sale for Amazon Prime members, Prime Big Deal Days, and there are still plenty of hefty discounts on headphones, earbuds and gaming headsets we recommend. We\u2019ve sorted through the best headphone deals of the October Prime Day event below, which include new lows on the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000XM5, Beats Studio Pro, Amazon Echo Buds and more. Just note that some, but not all, of the offers are only accessible if you subscribe to Prime.\n\nSony Prime Day headphone deals\n\nSony WH-1000XM4\n\nSony WH-1000XM4 $248 $348 Save $100 See at Amazon\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 is back down to $248, which is $20 more than its all-time low but roughly $80 below its average street price. This is Sony\u2019s last-gen pair of wireless noise-cancelers, but it still delivers powerful ANC, 30-ish hours of battery life and a similarly rich feature set as the newer WH-1000XM5 (which isn't on sale as of this writing). Unlike its successor, it can also fold up for easier storage. It doesn\u2019t have the XM5\u2019s adaptive ANC system, however, and its mic quality isn\u2019t as clear. It\u2019s slightly heavier too, plus it sounds a bit boomier out of the box. But for less than $250, it remains a great value. We gave the XM4 a review score of 94 back in 2020.\n\nSony WF-1000XM5\n\nSony WF-1000XM5 $278 $300 Save $22 See at Amazon\n\nThe in-ear Sony WF-1000XM5, meanwhile, are on sale for $278. That\u2019s only $20 off, but it marks the first discount we\u2019ve seen for the top pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide. We gave this true wireless pair a score of 87 earlier this year: Like Sony\u2019s over-ear models, it comes with a range of useful features, powerful noise cancellation and a warm yet detailed default sound. The design here is also much more agreeable than previous Sony earphones.\n\nSony LinkBuds S\n\nSony LinkBuds S $128 $200 Save $72 See at Amazon\n\nThe Sony LinkBuds S are on sale for $128, which is a price we\u2019ve seen in the past but still takes about $30 off the pair\u2019s average street price. We highlight the LinkBuds S as an honorable mention in our wireless earbuds guide, as we like its compact design, decent noise cancellation, handy bonus features and warm sound. It can\u2019t match the ANC strength or battery life of the WF-1000XM5, but it also costs a fair bit less, which helps.\n\nApple Prime Day headphone deals\n\nAirPods Pro\n\nApple AirPods Pro (USB-C) $189 $239 Save $50 See at Amazon\n\nThe USB-C version of Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro is down to $189, which is $60 off Apple\u2019s list price and a new low. The Lightning version is available for the same price. This is the \u201cbest for iOS\u201d pick in our buying guide. Both models still deliver strong ANC, a superb transparency mode and a pleasingly warm sound. They also come with a variety of Apple-specific features, including hands-free Siri access, Find My tracking and fast pairing with other Apple devices. A recent update added an \u201cAdaptive Audio\u201d mode that dynamically blends its ANC and transparency modes based on your surroundings, while the new USB-C model comes with improved dust resistance alongside the new charging port. That said, you really need to be committed to the Apple ecosystem to get the most out of this, and the six-hour battery life is just OK. We gave the AirPods Pro a score of 88 last year.\n\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen)\n\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen) $89 $129 Save $40 See at Amazon\n\nApple\u2019s second-gen AirPods, meanwhile, are back down to $89. That\u2019s $10 off their usual street price. We can\u2019t broadly recommend the base AirPods to most people these days, as their one-size-fits-all design won\u2019t work for everyone and there are better-sounding options for the money. However, if you\u2019re all-in on Apple devices and just want the usual AirPods perks in an unsealed design, this deal makes the pair a little more palatable.\n\nBeats Prime Day headphone deals\n\nBeats Studio Pro\n\nBeats Studio Pro $180 $350 Save $170 See at Amazon\n\nThe Beats Studio Pro is on sale for $180, which is a new low and a sizable $170 discount. We gave these wireless over-ears a review score of 81 in July: We can\u2019t recommend them over the top picks in our guide, but they offer a pleasant, even-handed sound, helpful ANC and the ability to stream higher-quality audio over a USB-C connection. Like most Beats headphones, they also play nice with Android. That said, multi-device pairing doesn\u2019t work with iOS, there\u2019s no wear detection and the mostly plastic design isn\u2019t super premium. But at this price, the Studio Pro could make sense if you really dig the Beats aesthetic.\n\nBeats Fit Pro\n\nBeats Fit Pro $160 $200 Save $40 See at Amazon\n\nThe Beats Fit Pro is down to $160, which is a price we\u2019ve seen multiple times in recent months but still takes $40 off the pair\u2019s MSRP. The Fit Pro is the \u201cbest for workouts\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds guide, as it offers most of the Apple-friendly perks you\u2019d get from a set of AirPods \u2014 Beats is a subsidiary of Apple \u2014 in a sportier, more stable design. Its punchy yet refined sound is a plus, and it uses physical control buttons instead of touch panels. However, it lacks multi-device pairing and wireless charging, and its ANC is a step down from the AirPods Pro. We gave the Fit Pro a review score of 87 in 2021.\n\nAnker Prime Day headphone deals\n\nSoundcore Space A40\n\nAnker Soundcore Space A40 $54 $100 Save $46 See at Amazon\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is on sale for $54, which matches its all-time low and comes in $25 less than usual. The Space A40 is the top pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds, as it includes a host of features that belie its price: adaptive ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging, a transparency mode and up to 10 hours of battery life. Its audio quality and ANC aren\u2019t quite as powerful as more expensive pairs, but both are more than effective enough for the money. Unlike many budget wireless headphones, its default sound doesn\u2019t completely blow out the bass. Just note that its call quality is mediocre, and it lacks wear detection, so it won\u2019t auto-pause when you remove an earbud.\n\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC\n\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC $80 $100 Save $20 See at Amazon\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC carry most of the same benefits as the Space A40 but use a \u201cstem\u201d design reminiscent of Apple\u2019s AirPods. They put a little more emphasis on the bass by default, but you can change that sound profile up with a few EQ tools in Anker\u2019s app. They also support wear detection. If you prefer this sort of form factor, the Liberty 4 NC is down to $80, which is a $20 discount and matches its lowest price to date.\n\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45\n\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45 $100 $150 Save $50 See at Amazon\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Space Q45 is on sale for $100, which is a $50 discount and an all-time low. While not as nice as most of the pricier models in this roundup, the Space Q45 is a fine value if you can\u2019t spend more than $100. Its adaptive ANC is better-than-average and can be set to a manual mode if needed, it supports multi-device pairing and its design is comfortable to wear for hours at a time. Sound quality is where the price is most evident, as it\u2019s a little too uneven in the treble, but its bass-heavy profile should work for fans of hip-hop and EDM. You can tweak the sound somewhat through the EQ tools in Anker\u2019s Soundcore app.\n\nAnker Soundcore Life Q30\n\nAnker Soundcore Life Q30 $56 $80 Save $24 See at Amazon\n\nIf you want a decent set of noise-canceling over-ears for as little as possible, the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 is also worth considering. It\u2019s now down to $56, which is $24 less than usual. This pair isn\u2019t built as well as the Space Q45, nor does it sound as nice out of the box, as it massively inflates the bass and degrades when ANC is active. Call quality is worse too. That said, it\u2019s comfortable, its battery can last more than 40 hours and the ANC itself is excellent for less than $60. You still get multi-device pairing and a customizable EQ as well.\n\nBose Prime Day headphone deals\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II $199 $279 Save $80 See at Amazon\n\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are available for $199, which is an all-time low and roughly $75 off their average street price. This pair has technically been replaced by Bose\u2019s new QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, which add a new spatial audio mode. That model isn\u2019t discounted as of this writing, however, and the two pairs are largely similar otherwise. The QC II\u2019s chief selling point is its ANC performance, which is still among the most powerful on the market. If that\u2019s your chief concern, saving $99 to buy the older pair may still make sense. Just note that it lacks multi-device pairing and wireless charging, and that its earpieces are on the bulky side. We gave the QC IIs a review score of 87 last year.\n\nBose QuietComfort 45\n\nBose QuietComfort 45 $229 $329 Save $100 See at Amazon\n\nAlong those lines, the Bose QuietComfort 45 are down to $229. That\u2019s $30 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked for these over-ears but still $80 below their average street price as of late. This is another noise-canceling set that Bose recently replaced, but the differences between the QC 45 and the new QuietComfort Headphones appear to be small, so the older model is worth a look when it\u2019s discounted like this. We gave the QC 45 a review score of 86 in 2021, and we still like its lightweight design, upper-tier ANC and easygoing sound. You can\u2019t manually adjust the intensity of the ANC, unlike the newer model, and Sony\u2019s XM5 and XM4 provide longer battery life and a more versatile feature set for those willing to pay up. But if that\u2019s not you, the QC 45 is a fine alternative at this price.\n\nSennheiser Prime Day headphone deals\n\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3\n\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 $142 $280 Save $138 See at Amazon\n\nThe Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 is available for $142, which is a new low. This pair has normally retailed around $180 in recent months. This is the runner-up pick in our wireless earbuds guide, as Engadget\u2019s resident audio expert Billy Steele considers it the best-sounding true wireless pair he\u2019s tested. That warm yet customizable sound is joined by a solid adaptive ANC system, though Sennheiser\u2019s pair isn\u2019t as effective as the Sony WF-1000XM5 in that regard, nor does it have the same deep feature set.\n\nSennheiser HD560S\n\nSennheiser HD 560S $150 $229 Save $79 See at Amazon\n\nWe\u2019re mostly sticking to wireless headphones here since that\u2019s just the way the market has moved, but if you want a quality wired model, the Sennheiser HD 560S is worth a look at $150. While not an all-time low, that\u2019s about $35 below the pair\u2019s typical street price. We recommend the HD 560S in our guide to the best gaming headphones. Its open-back design lets in and leaks a ton of noise, but it sounds spacious, detailed and well-balanced, which makes it a treat for critical listening. It\u2019s comfortable to wear for extended periods as well. Just don\u2019t expect much in the way of deep sub-bass response.\n\nOther Prime Day wireless headphone deals\n\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023)\n\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023) $35 $50 Save $15 See at Amazon\n\nPrime members can get the latest Amazon Echo Buds for $35, which is $15 off and an all-time low. This is another pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. Specifically, the Echo Buds should appeal to those who prefer a more open design, one that lets in outside noise but doesn\u2019t insert directly into your ear canal. They can sound solid for the price with a bit of EQ tweaking, and they support features we don\u2019t often see for less than $50, such as wear detection and multipoint connectivity. They also have Alexa baked in, natch. Their IPX2 sweat-resistance rating isn\u2019t enough for workouts, and their five-ish hours of battery life is just average, but they\u2019re worth a look if you\u2019re on a tight budget and hate the feel of traditional in-ear headphones. We gave them a score of 77 earlier this year.\n\nShokz OpenRun Pro\n\nShokz OpenRun Pro $125 $180 Save $55 See at Amazon\n\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is down to $125 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is $25 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked but still $55 below its usual going rate. This is a recommended pair of bone conduction headphones, which means it hugs the side of your head and delivers sound by passing vibrations through your skull. (It\u2019s not as uncomfortable as it sounds.) The main benefit is that this leaves your ear canals completely open, so you can enjoy a playlist or podcast without being shut out from the outside world. The downside, usually, is that you don\u2019t get as full a sound as you would with a traditional pair. That\u2019ll still be the case here, but we\u2019ve found the OpenRun Pro to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers. They\u2019re fairly comfy and get up to 10 hours of battery life beyond that.\n\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\n\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro $120 $200 Save $80 See at Amazon\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are on sale for $120, which is a new low and $80 off Google\u2019s list price. This is the \u201cbest for Android\u201d recommendation in our wireless earbuds guide, and it earned a review score of 87 last year. Its ANC and V-shaped sound profile aren\u2019t as superlative as our top picks, but they\u2019re fine, and the whole package integrates tightly with Google\u2019s line of Pixel phones. An upcoming firmware update promises improved call quality \u2014 one of our review\u2019s chief complaints \u2014 and the ability to automatically pause music when you\u2019re speaking, similar to what pairs from Sony and Apple offer. Those with smaller ear canals may find the fit to be tricky, though we had few issues with comfort in testing.\n\nJLab Go Air Pop\n\nJLab Go Air Pop $16 $25 Save $8 See at Amazon\n\nThe JLab Go Air Pop is down to $16.44 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is about $6 less than usual. We highlight this set in our budget wireless earbuds guide, as it gets you a compact shape, IPX4-rated water resistance, eight or so hours of battery life and a full set of functional touch controls for dirt cheap. Its boomy sound isn\u2019t exactly great, but it\u2019s serviceable, which is a victory when we\u2019re talking about $16 wireless earbuds. Plus, while it lacks a companion app, JLab bakes three EQ presets into the earbuds themselves.\n\nPrime Day gaming headset deals\n\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\n\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 $35 $50 Save $15 See at Amazon\n\nThe top budget pick in our gaming headphones buying guide, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, is on sale for $35. That\u2019s just a modest $5 discount but matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 doesn\u2019t have the most balanced or detailed sound, but its V-shaped signature gives action scenes a nice level of impact, and its mic quality belies the dirt-cheap price. The design is comfortable too, though it\u2019s made from cheap-feeling plastic.\n\nHyperX Cloud Alpha\n\nHyperX Cloud Alpha $60 $100 Save $40 See at Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay a little more, the HyperX Cloud Alpha is another decent value at $60, which is $15 or so lower than its typical street price. We note this as an honorable mention in our guide: It\u2019s been around for a few years now, but it\u2019s comfortable, and its detachable mic is solid. It\u2019s better built than the Cloud Stinger 2 as well. At this price, they don\u2019t sound bad either, though an underemphasized treble means they aren\u2019t especially detailed.\n\nLogitech G535\n\nLogitech G535 $80 $130 Save $50 See at Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a wireless headset, the Logitech G535 is back down to $80, which is about $25 below its average street price. This is an honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, as we like its lightweight design, Bluetooth support and agreeable, relatively well-balanced sound. It forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level though, and its mic makes voices sound a little too thin. It also doesn't work with Xbox consoles. But if you really want a wireless gaming headset for less than $100, it\u2019s well worth a look.\n\nYour October Prime Day Shopping Guide: See all of our Prime Day coverage.

    "body": "Young Emily Hand, born with a gift for dance, should be bouncing to her favorite Beyonc\u00e9 songs, celebrating her ninth birthday on Friday.\n\nInstead, \"she will have her birthday in the tunnels of Gaza,\" her grief-stricken father, Thomas Hand, told Fox News Digital in an interview this week in New York City.\n\n\"No party. No friends. She won\u2019t even know if it\u2019s day or night. There\u2019s no light down there. So she won\u2019t know it\u2019s her birthday.\"\n\nWOMAN VANDALIZES ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAPTIVES' OWN FAMILY IN NEW YORK CITY\n\nEmily woke up the morning of Oct. 7 after a sleepover at a friend\u2019s house in the kibbutz of Be\u2019eri in southern Israel.\n\nShe still \"had Disney pajamas on,\" her father said.\n\nHamas terrorists hauled her away along with her friend, Hila, and the other girl\u2019s mother, Raya.\n\nEmily was only 2\u00bd years old when her own mother died of breast cancer.\n\nShe's been raised by her dad and by others in their tightly knit kibbutz in the years since.\n\nThe child's birthday will be marked here in America with billboards that go on display in Times Square and Madison Square Garden in Manhattan at 8 a.m. on Friday.\n\n\"She will have her birthday in the tunnels of Gaza. No party. No friends. She won\u2019t even know if it\u2019s day or night.\"\n\nBillboards with images of Israelis held hostage in Gaza will also appear in 1,500 other locations in 48 cities across the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an effort to remind Americans that some 240 Israeli civilians, including children like Emily, were snatched from concerts, from their homes and even from their beds in a surprise attack by Hamas terrorists against unarmed civilian targets.\n\nBring Them Home Now, an organic volunteer group that came together in the hours after the attack, heads the international outreach effort.\n\nEmily, even at 9, is older than many of the hostages. The youngest was just 9 months old when snatched away as a trophy of terror.\n\nThomas Hand\u2019s suffering over the past 40 days has made international headlines. He was first told in the days after the terror attack that his little girl was dead.\n\nCHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE BY TERROR GROUP: \u2018BRING THEM HOME NOW\u2019 SAYS IT WON'T REST UNTIL ALL ARE RETURNED SAFELY\n\nHe said in one interview that he welcomed her death because it was better than her being held captive and tortured by Hamas.\n\nHe found out later that his daughter had been taken hostage by Hamas.\n\nEmily, \"just loved life and music,\" her father said. \"Beyonc\u00e9 is a favorite because Beyonc\u00e9 is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer. And so Emily would copy her.\"\n\n\"She had this gift that she could memorize movements, she could just memorize whole routines, and she would do it within a very short time.\"\n\nHer natural dancing talent was apparent to everyone in Be\u2019eri, not far from the border of Gaza.\n\n\"Every holiday they'd have performances of little kids and older kids, so she was always in it. But she was always there front and center because she would always remember the moves if the kids at the back didn't.\"\n\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 in particular is a favorite because Beyonc\u00e9 is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer \u2026 Emily would copy her.\"\n\nHand shared stories of his beautiful girl and the ugly circumstances of her abduction in an interview at Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nHand himself is not Jewish.\n\nHe was born in Dublin, Ireland, and raised Roman Catholic before moving in 1992 to Israel \u2014 a nation he called a multicultural \"paradise\" up until Oct. 7.\n\nHe last saw Emily the night of Oct. 6 at dinner in the communal dining room of the kibbutz.\n\nShe asked after dinner if she could sleep over her friend\u2019s house.\n\nHe agreed and kissed her goodbye.\n\nISRAELI MOM RECOUNTS LAST CALL FROM TERRIFIED DAUGHTER AS \u2018BRING THEM HOME NOW\u2019 VOWS FIND HAMAS HOSTAGES\n\nInitial reports that Emily had been killed were later refuted by official accounts.\n\n\"We had an eyewitness seeing her being led away by the terrorists with her friend where she was doing a sleepover and the mother of that friend. So it's absolutely confirmed that she was taken away by the terrorists and is in the tunnels of Gaza now.\"\n\nEmily and the others in the family she was staying with hid, like many of the hostages taken from homes, in the household bomb shelters common in Israel. They're designed to protect Israeli citizens from frequent missile attacks.\n\nOfficials told Hand \"in all probability she's in Gaza because there was no blood in the bomb shelter and there was no blood in the house that matched Emily's DNA,\" he said.\n\nLife has been almost unbearable for him since that day.\n\nHand was described as \"fragile\" by one person working with family members of the Israeli hostages.\n\nHand spoke to Fox News Digital beside Michael Levy, whose brother Or was also taken hostage by terrorists.\n\nHand said he's lost about 18 pounds since his little girl was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nThey were accompanied by Israeli mental health expert Dr. Ofrit Shapira-Berman.\n\n\"I'm Irish, so I have a couple of beers before I go to bed and that sets me off because I don't want to think,\" the father said. \"I wouldn't be able to sleep. I'm eating very little. My stomach is shrunk.\"\n\nA lean man to begin with, Hand said he\u2019s lost 8 kilos \u2014 about 18 pounds \u2014 since his little girl was taken hostage.\n\n\"I had a hot dog today. I always wanted an American hot dog, and I was full after that.\"\n\nHe's lost interest in news amid his own pain and the ongoing pain of the entire nation of Israel.\n\n\"I'm a refugee. I have no home to go back to.\"\n\n\"At first it was a morbid curiosity to maybe see Emily amongst it all. And then it was just too much. I couldn't watch it anymore. I don't watch the news. I don't watch these videos.\"\n\nHe\u2019s also been homeless since Be\u2019eri was savaged.\n\n\"I'm a refugee,\" he said. \"I have no home to go back to.\"\n\nThe community \"lost 112 murdered and so many, many more kidnapped\" among a population of about 1,200.\n\n\"Your whole community was devastated. Yeah, we\u2019re all refugees,\" he said. \"We\u2019re all living in various hotels all over the country.\"\n\nYehudit Weiss was one of the residents of Be\u2019eri taken hostage on Oct. 7. Israeli Defense Forces reported on Thursday that they found her body in a building adjacent to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which Israel says Hamas had been using as a headquarters.\n\nHand expressed hope that the billboards going on display in Times Square on his daughter\u2019s birthday, and then around the U.S., will remind Americans of the ongoing terror and antisemitism suffered by Israeli families \u2014 and do so in a medium that can't be defaced or removed from public view amid ongoing anti-Israeli hatred.\n\n\"The great thing about these billboards is that these \u2014 I don\u2019t know what to call these people \u2014 won\u2019t be able to rip down the images,\" Hand said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"That\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t understand. That they, children and the babies \u2014 they\u2019ve been taken away, they\u2019re kidnapped, they\u2019re lost to us. And you know, just trying to make awareness, and they\u2019re ripping them off with glee, with happiness.\"\n\nMinutes later, Hand and Levy were standing outside the synagogue, looking at posters of Israeli kidnap victims mounted on a fence in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nA woman walked by and began tearing down the posters \u2014 a shocking indignity following the pain they had just shared and a visceral example of the intolerance suffered by Israelis in the Middle East and in the United States.\n\nThe father, already deeply pained, was incensed. He shouted out angrily, while the woman moved quickly down the sidewalk. She raised a hand behind her as if to mock the suffering father's pain.\n\n\"My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else. She's in terror every day.\"\n\nFurther pain is still to come, Hand said, if and when the hostages return and find out loved ones have been killed and entire families massacred.\n\nHe's also haunted by the fear Emily has suffered since Oct. 7 and now here on what should be her joyous birthday celebration embraced by the love of their kibbutz.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else,\" Hand said.\n\n\"She's in terror every day.\"\n\nSydney Borchers and Brittany Kasko of Fox News Digital contributed reporting."

    "body": "Share All sharing options for: The best comedy movies to watch on Netflix, Prime, Max, and more\n\nYour time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nComedy can feel like an ignored genre in modern moviemaking.\n\nHorror\u2019s having a fantastic 2023. Thrillers come out on a weekly basis. Even action movies have had some stellar recent releases. But Hollywood has been in a comedic rut in recent years, with fewer and fewer notable releases from big studios.\n\nBut fear not, dear reader \u2014 we know how to find some good laughs. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best comedy movies you can watch at home, scraping streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and HBO Max, as well as free services, to find the best of the best.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a romantic comedy that makes your heart sing while bringing out a smile or a gut-busting laugh-out-loud comedy, we have a variety of options sure to bring you laughter and brighten up your night.\n\nHere are our picks for the best comedy movies you can watch at home right now. If you\u2019re only looking for the best comedy movies on Netflix, we\u2019ve got you covered there, too. Our latest update to this list added The Road to El Dorado as an editor\u2019s pick.\n\nEditor\u2019s pick\n\nThe Road to El Dorado\n\nYear: 2000\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1hr 29m\n\nDirectors: Eric \u201cBibo\u201d Bergeron, Don Paul, Jeffrey Katzenberg\n\nCast: Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez\n\nThe Road to El Dorado came out at the wrong time.\n\nThe animated buddy comedy came out during the transition point between the Disney Renaissance and the eventual wave of crass CG movies ushered in by Shrek (what I\u2019ve dubbed the Beloved Failures era). But even though it failed spectacularly in theaters, home video turned it into a cult classic and a meme powerhouse. So many frames of the movie have been repurposed as reaction GIFs and meme templates, but while the vivid facial expressions and body movement of the animated characters certainly lends itself to memeable formats, the movie itself is truly hilarious.\n\nThe setup is already promising: two runaway con men from Spain somehow end up in South America, where the locals of El Dorado believe them to be gods. But the banter between pragmatic Tulio and idealistic Miguel is absolutely amazing, with Kline and Branagh slipping into an easy and comedic repartee (not to mention the shipping potential that comes from their married-couple-like banter). Toss in snarky Chel (Rosie Perez), a local who wants out of the city, and the trio is electric \u2014 and distinctly made up of morally gray lying characters, a rarity in that era of animation where heroes and princesses save the day.\n\nThe three of them attempt to leave El Dorado with buckets of gold, but first they must play along with the charade, which only gets them into increasingly ridiculous situations. They partake in local festivities, go 2-vs-15 in a sports game, and eventually have to defend El Dorado from Conquistador Hernan Cortez. With each impossible feat, the ragtag trio of schemers pulls it off again and again, heightening their antics and plans \u2014 all with excellent banter (and a banging Elton John soundtrack). \u2014 Petrana Radulovic\n\nThe Road to El Dorado is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nBook Club\n\nYear: 2018\n\nRun time: 1h 44m\n\nDirector: Bill Holderman\n\nCast: Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, Mary Steenburgen\n\nThis delightful and raunchy romantic comedy stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen as a group of best friends who have been a part of a long-standing book club. Each of them, though successful in their careers, are dealing with crises of life or love. When one of them picks Fifty Shades of Grey as the next book they\u2019ll all read together, it opens the group up in a lovely story of personal acceptance and self-realization, no matter what stage of life you find yourself in. \u2014PV\n\nBook Club is available to stream on Paramount Plus and FuboTV, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\n\nCatherine Called Birdy\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRun time: 1h 48m\n\nDirector: Lena Dunham\n\nCast: Bella Ramsey, Andrew Scott, Billie Piper\n\nLena Dunham\u2019s adaptation of the beloved children\u2019s novel is an outstanding coming-of-age story that is the rare book-to-movie adaptation done right. It\u2019s a warm story about the difficulties of teenage girlhood and all the expectations that come with it in any era (but especially medieval times), anchored by excellent central performances from Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones) and Andrew Scott (Fleabag).\n\nRamsey plays a young girl named Birdy, whose father (Scott) is attempting to arrange a marriage for her in order to save the family\u2019s finances. A strong-willed girl with a penchant for playfulness and mischief, Birdy is intent on disrupting her father\u2019s plans for her. The movie excels through its layered portrayals of Birdy and her father \u2014 neither is pure hero or pure villain, and Dunham complicates the book\u2019s portrayal of the two to much success.\n\nI put Catherine Called Birdy on one Saturday afternoon, expecting it to be enjoyable background fare while I played some games and did some work around the house. Instead, I was completely enthralled for all 108 minutes. It\u2019s one of the most delightful movies of the year, and I can not recommend it highly enough. \u2014PV\n\nCatherine Called Birdy is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nCharade\n\nYear: 1963\n\nRun time: 1h 54m\n\nDirector: Stanley Donen\n\nCast: Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau\n\nThe heist at the center of Charade was successful years prior to the movie, and without realizing it, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) has been living off the profits from her husband\u2019s crime. When he is suddenly murdered, she realizes she didn\u2019t really know anything about him \u2014 or, for that matter, the new man in her life, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant). To make matters worse, the remaining money is missing, and a lot of terrible people think Reggie knows where it is. As more people are pulled into the orbit of the money, it becomes less clear who, if anyone, Reggie can trust.\n\nHepburn and Grant, two famously talented and charming stars, are at their most charming and talented in Charade. In the span of a single scene, Hepburn might move from pragmatic to seductive to fearful with believable ease. Grant\u2019s initial discomfort with their age gap \u2014 25 years, a still-not-uncommon chasm in Hollywood \u2014 resulted in rewrites to the script to make clear that Reggie was pursuing him; it remains one of the few movies in which the gap is acknowledged and dealt with believably, rather than taken for granted. Their chemistry is immediate and undeniable; it\u2019s key in carrying off the film\u2019s snappy dialogue and mixture of flirtatious comedy, captivating mystery, and genuine thriller. It\u2019s His Girl Friday by way of Hitchcock. \u2014Jenna Stoeber\n\nCharade is available to stream on Prime Video, for free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, or for free with ads on Vudu, The Roku Channel, Freevee, Tubi, and Pluto TV. It is also available for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\n\nClueless\n\nYear: 1995\n\nRun time: 1h 37m\n\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\n\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd\n\nThere have been many adaptations of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma over the years \u2014 and many actresses taking on Jane Austen\u2019s self-proclaimed unlikable heroine. There\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow in the pastel-swathed 1990s version who makes Emma haughty, yet lovable; Joanna Sotomura in the 2013 webseries Emma Approved turns the socialite into an ambitious, albeit misguided lifestyle guru; and more recently, Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s rendition of the character gives her a piercing mean streak worthy of the original.\n\nAll these Emmas have their own merits, but sometimes the most memorable Emma isn\u2019t an Emma at all, but a Cher.\n\nClueless takes the general framework of Emma \u2014 a rich, bored young woman who just can\u2019t stop getting involved in everyone\u2019s business \u2014 and transports the story from Regency-era England to 1990s Beverly Hills. Emma is now Cher, played wonderfully by Alicia Silverstone, a chic, stylish, and popular high school student who thinks she knows what\u2019s best for everyone.\n\nThe beats of Jane Austen\u2019s original story still play out. Cher takes an unpopular new student under her wing and tries to set her up with a hot match that\u2019ll catapult her to social fame. All those matches end up being catastrophic failures. Cher goes too far and learns a bit about herself along the way. All of it is done with bright, bold 1990s fashion and slang, with iconic quotable lines and the very best that teen movies have to offer. Come for young Paul Rudd, stay for the sentiment that stories are timeless and that human traits transcend eras (and also Cher\u2019s digital closet). \u2014Petrana Radulovic\n\nClueless is available to stream on Paramount Plus or for free with ads on Pluto TV.\n\nComing to America\n\nYear: 1988\n\nRun time: 1h 56m\n\nDirector: John Landis\n\nCast: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones\n\nEddie Murphy stars in the 1988 romantic comedy Coming to America as Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African country of Zamunda who, tired of his mother and father\u2019s meddling in his love life, journeys to the borough of Queens in New York City with his personal aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to search for a wife. Directed by John Landis and based on a story by Murphy, Coming to America is packed with endlessly quotable performances by Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Louie Anderson, John Amos, and Murphy and Arsenio in multiple roles. The movie is an absolute riot front to back and an enduring classic for good reason: It\u2019s one of Murphy\u2019s finest films. \u2014Toussaint Egan\n\nComing to America is available to stream on Netflix, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\n\nDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\n\nYear: 2011\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Johnnie To, Wai Ka-fai\n\nCast: Louis Koo, Daniel Wu, Gao Yuanyuan\n\nJohnnie To is one of our great modern directors, equally adept in hard-boiled triad crime dramas and light-hearted romantic comedies alike. 2011\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart falls in the latter category, and is one of the many high marks of the Hong Kong director\u2019s legendary career. Fresh off the end of a long-term relationship, Chi-yan (Gao Yuanyuan) is an analyst for an investment bank who finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. On one side, there\u2019s Sean (Louis Koo), a CEO who works across the street from Chi-yan and yearns for her through the tall corporate glass windows that separate them. On the other, there\u2019s Kevin (the always-dreamy Daniel Wu), an alcoholic former architect who helps Chi-Yan move on and is inspired by her to start creating again. What follows is a sincere, funny, and truly charming romantic time. \u2014PV\n\nDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nEega\n\nYear: 2012\n\nRun time: 2h 14m\n\nDirector: S.S. Rajamouli\n\nCast: Sudeepa, Nani, Samantha\n\nOne of the very best movies on Netflix, the logline for Eega will clue you in right away as to whether this movie is up your alley or not. A whirlwind slapstick comedy revenge thriller from the director of RRR and the Baahubali movies, Eega is about a man who is murdered by a romantic rival and reincarnated as a fly, teaming up with the woman he loves to exact revenge on the man who killed him. It\u2019s joyously fun and absolutely bonkers (complimentary), with exciting action sequences, groundbreaking visual effects, and plenty of laugh-out-loud jokes. Much to its benefit, the fly in Eega is completely silent, instead pushing director Rajamouli to employ some classic tricks from silent cinema for laughs and gasps alike. \u2014PV\n\nEega is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nThe Gold Rush\n\nYear: 1925\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 28m\n\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\n\nCast: Charlie Chaplin, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain\n\nCharlie Chaplin\u2019s adventurous comedy is nearly 100 years old, and it absolutely still holds up for the modern sense of humor. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin\u2019s \u201cLittle Tramp\u201d is a prospector living on a shack in the middle of the Klondike. Extreme slapstick and farce ensue, as Little Tramp\u2019s blown by Canadian winds, stoops to eating a leather shoe for sustenance, and eventually performs his legendary fork dance. Chaplin \u2014 even more than the muscle icons of the 1980s \u2014 is the key DNA to modern action entertainment, and if you\u2019ve never seen one of his classics, The Gold Rush is a hilarious entry point. \u2014Matt Patches\n\nThe Gold Rush is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel or for free with ads on Freevee, Tubi, and Plex. It is also available for for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.\n\nI Married a Witch\n\nYear: 1942\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 16m\n\nDirector: Ren\u00e9 Clair\n\nCast: Fredric March, Veronica Lake, Robert Benchley\n\nRen\u00e9 Clair, who made his name in early French silent and sound cinema, spent a few years making movies in the U.S. during World War II. Among them is the exemplary black-and-white romantic comedy I Married a Witch, which stars the incomparable Veronica Lake as a witch who hopes to exact revenge on the descendant of the man who imprisoned her by making him fall in love with her.\n\nWhen two witches \u2014 Jennifer (Lake) and her father, Daniel (Cecil Kellaway) \u2014 are burned at the stake by Puritans in colonial Salem, they curse the man who denounced them. He and his descendants (all played by Fredric March) will be doomed to be unhappy in love, always marrying \u201cthe wrong woman.\u201d Jennifer and Daniel awake 270 years later, and she begins pursuing her target: Wallace Wooley, the latest descendant of the man that caused her execution and also a leading candidate for governor. Oh, and his wedding to the daughter of his top political supporter is tomorrow.\n\nWith costumes by the legendary Edith Head, charming practical effects (the two witches are represented by wisps of smoke before inhabiting bodies), and plenty of hilarious gags (there\u2019s a \u201cpopped maize\u201d vendor during the \u201cintermission\u201d of the witches\u2019 execution), I Married a Witch is a breezy 77 minutes of Classic Hollywood delight. \u2014PV\n\nI Married a Witch is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang\n\nYear: 2005\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 42m\n\nDirector: Shane Black\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is, without a doubt, one of if not the funniest and most effortlessly cool movies I have ever seen. Partially based on Brett Halliday\u2019s 1941 novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them, Shane Black\u2019s neo-noir black comedy crime thriller stars Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart, a petty thief who, due to a series of extraordinary circumstances, is mistaken for an actor and whisked away from the back alleys of New York to the twinkling lights of Los Angeles for a screen test. While there, Harry inadvertently finds himself ensnared in a murder mystery involving his childhood crush (Michelle Monaghan), a sarcastic private detective (Val Kilmer), and a retired actor named (Corbin Bernsen) with a terrible secret to hide.\n\nRelentlessly meta, wickedly funny, and boasting one of the coolest opening title sequences of its time, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the rough-and-tumble blueprint to Black\u2019s 2016 movie The Nice Guys, and by all degrees the better film of the two. \u2014TE\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is available for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\n\nYear: 2004\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 58m\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nCast: Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett\n\nWes Anderson\u2019s eccentric 2004 ensemble comedy is dedicated to Jacques Cousteau and is a loving (and hilarious) homage to the legendary French oceanographer. Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is an oceanographer/documentarian who loses his best friend to a shark attack while working on his project. Zissou sets out for his next project: to find and kill the shark, and film the whole thing.\n\nThe hilarious ensemble cast includes Anjelica Huston (Zissou\u2019s estranged wife who finances his projects), Willem Dafoe (an emotionally insecure German first mate), Owen Wilson (a Zissou super-fan who believes he is Zissou\u2019s son), and Jeff Goldblum (playing Zissou\u2019s rival, a more successful oceanographer). With an excellent soundtrack of Portuguese David Bowie covers by Brazilian singer-songwriter Seu Jorge and Anderson\u2019s typical attention to detail in composition, The Life Aquatic is a cinematic feast of the senses. \u2014PV\n\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is for free with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nLittle Monsters\n\nYear: 2019\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Abe Forsythe\n\nCast: Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Alexander England, Josh Gad\n\nDirector Abe Forsythe\u2019s 2019 horror comedy Little Monsters stars Alexander England (Alien: Covenant) as Dave, a foul-mouthed and down-on-his-luck rock musician living with his sister and nephew after a rough breakup. Attempting to get on the good side of Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), his nephew\u2019s kindergarten teacher, Dave agrees to come along and chaperone the class\u2019 field trip to a petting zoo. Unfortunately for them, the petting zoo sits right next to a U.S. Army base that happens to be experiencing a zombie outbreak. As the class finds itself cornered by the undead horde, Dave will have to help Miss Caroline to make sure everyone gets out alive. Can he win her heart, or at the very least grow as a person for the experience? We won\u2019t spoil it, but we will tell you Josh Gad gets attacked by zombies in the process. \u2014TE\n\nLittle Monsters is available to stream on Hulu.\n\nLove & Friendship\n\nYear: 2016\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: Whit Stillman\n\nCast: Kate Beckinsale, Xavier Samuel, Emma Greenwell\n\nWhit Stillman\u2019s uproarious adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Lady Susan stars Kate Beckinsale in one of her richest (and most hilarious) roles. Beckinsale plays Lady Susan, a young widow looking to secure appropriate matches for both her daughter (Morfydd Clark) and herself. Susan flirts and schemes her way throughout the movie to the delight of the audience and the frustration of her suitors and friends.\n\nLove & Friendship features terrific supporting turns by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny (as Susan\u2019s supportive best friend), Tom Bennett (playing a hilariously dense wealthy fool), and the rest of the cast, as well as Stillman\u2019s characteristic biting dialogue and an attention to detail in sets and costuming. But the whole thing is brought together by Beckinsale\u2019s transcendent performance, one of the more recent examples of how comedic roles get ignored during awards season. \u2014PV\n\nLove & Friendship is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nMagic Mike and Magic Mike XXL\n\nYear: 2012 (Magic Mike); 2015 (Magic Mike XXL)\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 50m (Magic Mike); 1h 55m (Magic Mike XXL)\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh (Magic Mike); Gregory Jacobs (Magic Mike XXL)\n\nCast: Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello\n\nTwo joyous celebrations of bodies in motion contained within working class stories of trying to Make It Work in the face of a grueling world? Pure excellence. Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and the rest of the ensemble cast soar, and both movies contain unforgettable set-pieces sure to get you off your feet.\n\nSteven Soderbergh\u2019s Magic Mike is an excellent subversive rom-com, inverting many standard gender tropes in the genre. The follow-up, Magic Mike XXL, is even more rapturously joyous than the first, celebrating pleasure in its many forms (in this way, you could say it is like Hellraiser without the pain). XXL also doubles as a road trip movie and a \u201cthe crew gets back together for one last job\u201d movie. Also: Manganiello goes all out in a minimart dancing to \u201cI Want It That Way.\u201d Perfection, no notes. \u2014PV\n\nMagic Mike and Magic Mike XXL are available to stream for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nMoonstruck\n\nYear: 1987\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Norman Jewison\n\nCast: Cher, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Gardenia\n\nThe joy is in the smaller moments in Moonstruck. A mother cooks an egg-in-a-hole for her daughter. An older couple trades barbs with each other before the conversation shifts on a dime to expressions of eternal love. An elderly man basks in the moonlight with his five adorable dogs.\n\nA widow (Cher) is convinced her ill-fated first marriage was doomed by bad luck after a hasty engagement and wedding. When a suitor (Danny Aiello) proposes, she accepts, but ends up falling for his estranged brother (Nicolas Cage) instead.\n\nWith warm sets that feel lived-in, loving depictions of food (the egg-in-a-hole has since been colloquially dubbed \u201cMoonstruck Eggs\u201d) and romance, hilarious family conversations (\u201cOld man, you give another plate of my food to those dogs, I\u2019m going to kick you till you\u2019re dead!\u201d), and complementary lead performances by an assured Cher and an intense Cage, Moonstruck is a touching, uproarious romantic comedy about superstition, love, and family. \u2014PV\n\nMoonstruck is available to stream for free with ads on Pluto TV, Tubi, and The Roku Channel, with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nMultiple Maniacs\n\nYear: 1970\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: John Waters\n\nCast: Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce\n\nThe early transgressive comedies of John Waters have been anointed by Criterion as art, and one can only imagine what Waters circa 1970 would make of that. Multiple Maniacs, the provocateur\u2019s second film, is just batshit nutso, constructing a flimsy scenario in which Lady Divine (Waters\u2019 go-to collaborator) spirals out of control on a murder spree and her ex-lover (David Lochary) plots to kill her first with other members of Waters\u2019 Dreamlander acting troupe. In true Waters fashion, the plot is an excuse for bodily fluid expulsion, flamboyant performance, and a moment of backdoor penetration courtesy of a sacred religious object. Today, with scrutiny from every side of the ideological spectrum, it would be almost impossible to do what Waters pulled off back in the \u201970s. Criterion knew what it was doing preserving these jaw-dropping memories. \u2014MP\n\nMultiple Maniacs is available to stream on HBO Max and Criterion Channel, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon and Google Play.\n\nThe Paper Tigers\n\nYear: 2020\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 48m\n\nDirector: Bao Tran (Tran Quoc Bao)\n\nCast: Alain Uy, Ron Yuan, Mykel Shannon Jenkins\n\nTran Quoc Bao\u2019s kung fu action comedy stars Alain Uy, Ron Yuan (Mulan), and Mykel Shannon Jenkins as the eponymous Paper Tigers: three former martial arts prodigies who, after a lifetime of strenuous training and hard fighting, have grown into beleaguered middle-aged nobodies. But when their master is murdered, the three swear an oath to avenge his memory and bring his killer to justice. If that sounds serious, please know this falls into the Apatowian camp of Dumb Man comedy. \u2014TE\n\nThe Paper Tigers is available to stream for free with ads on Tubi, for free with a library card on Hoopla and Kanopy, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nPlus One\n\nYear: 2019\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 39m\n\nDirectors: Jeff Chan, Andrew Rhymer\n\nCast: Maya Erskine, Jack Quaid\n\nNetflix may be cranking out romantic comedies, but the best still come from a more personal, filmmaker-driven place. Plus One, from Pen15 writers Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival before quietly settling into a place on streaming and has been largely overlooked. Don\u2019t miss it: Maya Erskine (Pen15) and Jack Quaid (The Boys) star as best buds who\u2019ve seen all of their friends get hitched and have become go-to plus ones for the endless marathon of nuptials. Formula works to the movie\u2019s advantage, finding sweet humor in modern situations and wringing Erskine and Quaid for every drip of charisma they have to offer. A gem that could easily been mistaken as product in our current era of rom-coms. \u2014MP\n\nPlus One is available to stream for free with a library card on Hoopla, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain\n\nYear: 1952\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 42m\n\nDirectors: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen\n\nCast: Gene Kelly, Donald O\u2019Connor, Debbie Reynolds\n\nWhat is there to say about one of the most well-loved movies of all time? I\u2019ll tell you this: If Singin\u2019 in the Rain wasn\u2019t on this list, we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs right.\n\nStanley Donen and Gene Kelly\u2019s timeless 1952 classic is as joyous and funny as you remember \u2014 Donald O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cMake \u2019Em Laugh\u201d bit will leave you in stitches \u2014 but it\u2019s probably a bit stranger, too. In addition to all the industry jokes and the contemplation on the addition of sound to movies, the 13-minute dream sequence \u201cBroadway Melody\u201d is absolutely hypnotizing. \u2014PV\n\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nSpy\n\nYear: 2015\n\n\ufeffRun time: 2h\n\nDirector: Paul Feig\n\nCast: Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham\n\nAs the biggest blockbusters in the world have become more and more comedy-oriented, there\u2019s been less space for true comedies in theaters. Spy is the rare exception, and it\u2019s finally more broadly available to watch at home after its addition to the Max catalog.\n\nA sendup of espionage movies from director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Freaks and Geeks), it stars a pitch-perfect Melissa McCarthy as a desk worker for the CIA who is forced into active duty when her partner (Jude Law) is killed by the daughter of an arms dealer (Rose Byrne, who is positively delightful in this). Add in scene-stealing turns from Jason Statham as an overconfident Bond parody, Allison Janney as McCarthy\u2019s skeptical boss, and appearances by Bobby Cannavale, Peter Serafinowicz, and Miranda Hart, and you\u2019ve got a rollicking good time (with terrific action shot by Day Shift director J.J. Perry). \u2014PV\n\nSpy is available to stream on Max, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\n\nSupport the Girls\n\nYear: 2018\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 33m\n\nDirector: Andrew Bujalski\n\nCast: Regina Hall, Haley Lu Richardson, James Le Gros\n\nThis terrific day-in-the-life comedy from writer-director Andrew Bujalski (Computer Chess) follows the manager (Regina Hall) of a Hooters-like sports bar as she deals with training new hires, rude customers crossing lines, and an idiotic boss, all the while trying to take care of her girls through various major and minor crises.\n\nHall, one of the great performers of our time, gives a tremendously layered performance in one of the richest roles she\u2019s had the opportunity to play. Hall\u2019s Lisa is a protective force in the lives of her girls, able to put on a brave face in front of them (and in support of them) even when the circumstances around them seem on the verge of a total spiral. Haley Lu Richardson (as the peppy Maci) and Shayna \u201cJunglepussy\u201d McHayle (as the no-nonsense Danyelle) stand out among the movie\u2019s many great supporting turns.\n\nFunny, heartwarming, and undeniably tangible in its ground-level depiction of a hectic workplace, Support the Girls is a movie about looking out for each other in a trying world. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \u2014PV\n\nSupport the Girls is available to stream on Prime Video, Hulu, The Criterion Channel, for free with a library card on Kanopy or Hoopla, for free with ads on The Roku Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nTampopo\n\nYear: 1985\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 54m\n\nDirector: Juzo Itami\n\nCast: Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto, K\u014dji Yakusho\n\nThis 1985 \u201cramen western\u201d is a hilarious romp that also happens to be one of the most gorgeous depictions of food ever put on screen. When a pair of truck drivers stop at a run-down ramen shop, they befriend the widowed owner and help her turn the restaurant's fortunes around. A lovely story of community, passion, and human nature all filtered through the appreciation of good food, Tampopo is a cinematic feast. \u2014PV\n\nTampopo is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\n\nTo Be or Not to Be\n\nYear: 1942\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 39m\n\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\n\nCast: Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack\n\nErnst Lubitsch\u2019s 1942 masterpiece is an uproarious and touching anti-war story about a group of actors who use their theatrical skills to dupe a group of Nazi soldiers in occupied Warsaw. Superstar acting couple Joseph (Jack Benny) and Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) run a theater planning to put on a performance of \u201cGestapo,\u201d a comedic play satirizing Hitler. But when Germany invades and a Nazi spy schemes to give a list of secret identities of Resistance fighters to the Nazis, the troupe uses every theater trick in the book to outmaneuver the Nazis (including a visiting Hitler himself) and do their part in the war effort.\n\nWith hilarious repeated gags, disguises galore, and a rock-solid emotional foundation of a group of people trying to look out for each other in the face of evil, To Be or Not to Be is a high mark in the history of American cinema and one of my personal favorite movies ever made. \u2014PV\n\nTo Be or Not to Be is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\n\nThe Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience\n\nYear: 2019\n\n\ufeffRun time: 30m\n\nDirector: Mike Diva, Akiva Schaffer\n\nCast: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer\n\nThe Lonely Island dropped this musical movie \u2014 a spoof of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade focused on Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire\u2019s notorious 1980s home run streak \u2014 out of nowhere in 2019. It deserves more love.\n\nIn line with their previous efforts, like Tour de Pharmacy and 7 Days in Hell (co-starring Kit Harington!), The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience explores the shared psyche of Canseco and McGwire through poetry, abstract imagery, and profane lyrics. Alana Haim, Maya Rudolph, Hannah Simone, Jenny Slate, Jim O\u2019Heir, and Sterling K. Brown \u2014 as Sia \u2014 all appear. Surprisingly, Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer don\u2019t skimp on the darkness of the Bash Brothers. With lyrics like \u201cStab that needle in my ass until I am rich / Make me a god with the chemical sciences,\u201d the Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience eventually finds McGwire begging a vision of his father to save his life as Canseco raps about how therapy is for the weak. \u2014MP\n\nThe Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nWheels on Meals\n\nYear: 1984\n\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 38m\n\nDirector: Sammo Hung\n\nCast: Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao\n\nFew creative teams have ever managed the consistent level of excellence that Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao did with their Hong Kong martial arts action comedies in the 1980s, and Wheels on Meals is one of the best of an outrageously good group of movies (and my personal favorite). Set and shot in Barcelona, the movie centers on Thomas (Chan) and David (Yuen), a pair of cousins who run a food truck (with skateboarding tricks to boot) and find themselves enamored with a local woman (Lola Forner). When they run into a somewhat incompetent private investigator (Sammo Hung) who is also looking for the woman, the group bands together to save her when she is suddenly kidnapped.\n\nWheels on Meals features some of the very best fight scenes of Jackie Chan\u2019s prolific filmography, as he squares off against legendary kickboxer Benny Urquidez (the two would later fight again in Dragons Forever), who at the time was among the most prominent and successful fighters in the world. The whole movie is worth your time, but if you want to just find their six-minute marathon fight session on YouTube, there are few things better in this world.\n\nIf you like this, you should also check out Project A, which came out a year before and features one of the most daring and jaw-dropping stunts of Chan\u2019s illustrious career. \u2014PV\n\nWheels on Meals is available to stream for free with ads on Plex and FreeVee, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon."

    "body": "Palestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by the war between Israel and Hamas\n\nGaza, despite being one of the most economically challenged regions in the world, has ironically always been a tech hub \u2014 not only for Palestine and Palestinians, but also for the world: International companies have, for many years, sought out a presence there to collaborate with talented tech freelancers and the startups that gradually emerged from the region. For example, according to sources who helped build those bridges, Nvidia, famed for its role in the new AI boom, has been working with at least 100 engineers from the region for years. (Tragically, the initiative to employ Palestinians in this outsourcing was that of Mellanox founder Eyal Waldman, whose daughter was brutally murdered in the attacks by Hamas).\n\nSince at least 2008, TechCrunch been covering technology companies out of Palestine, some serving their direct audience, some serving the tech world internationally. Silicon Valley had taken an increasing interest in Palestine as a tech hub, but like the ecosystem itself, it\u2019s nascent: To date, those working in the region estimate that as much as $10 million has been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem.\n\nNotably, in 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff joined Silicon Valley luminaries in backing the first-ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.\n\nGaza Sky Geeks, an Alphabet-backed initiative based in Gaza that provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine\u2019s Gazan population, has been a beacon of entrepreneurship in the region.\n\nAll of that is now effectively gone, like the buildings in Gaza itself.\n\nIsrael is currently retaliating militarily against the attacks on its people, on its soil, and the hostages subsequently taken by Hamas \u2014 the ruling organization in Gaza that kidnapped at least 150 people and took them into Gaza during brutal attacks on Israel last weekend that killed 1,300 people.\n\nThat strategy has seen Israel pummeling the \u201cGaza Strip\u201d with bombs to eradicate it of Hamas and to get its hostages back. Over 1,500 people in Palestine so far have been killed as a result. The tech industry in Israel \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest export and its biggest single contributor to GDP \u2014 is also taking a big knock, but inevitably the impact on the smaller and more fragile ecosystem in Gaza has been significantly more serious. The physical, economic and societal destruction resulting from that leaves any future for the tech industry there in doubt.\n\nQuite simply, there is no escaping the consequences of the war for anyone, let alone tech workers.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening to tech in Gaza is that Israel is crunching it. Obliterating it,\u201d one source inside the territory told TechCrunch.\n\nIsrael has now amassed soldiers near the north of Gaza, ahead of an expected ground offensive into the densely populated enclave. About 1.1 million people living in northern areas have been told to leave in the next day. The UN has warned of \u201cdevastating humanitarian consequences\u201d from these latest moves. A total blockade on the territory is being enforced with fuel, food and water running out. Israel says it won\u2019t lift the restrictions unless Hamas frees all hostages.\n\nSpeaking to Ryan Sturgill, an American national and former head of the Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG) accelerator run by sponsor Mercy Corps, an NGO aid organization, the situation on the ground appears dire, after waves of shelling by the Israeli military.\n\n\u201cThe area around the the Mercy Corps building, which housed Gaza Sky Geeks, has been leveled. The structure is standing but blown out. The front of it is sort of ripped off,\u201d he said.\n\nGaza Sky Geeks is the largest tech hub in Palestine, providing a wide range of tech training at scale. In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the program.\n\nVideo evidence (and pictured above) posted on LinkedIn shows a blown-out building with the Mercy Corps sign.\n\n\u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen. The offices are destroyed, the fiber lines are destroyed. The universities are destroyed. Three main universities in Gaza that produce all the computer science grads are leveled. I don\u2019t even know if people will ever be able to go back to Northern Gaza after what\u2019s happening today.The educational institutions that are there are gone,\u201d Sturgill added.\n\nHe had been helping Palestinian tech startups raise capital in the West Bank and Gaza since January.\n\n\u201cUntil now, there had been a pretty significant growth. A lot of companies in Saudi Arabia have been setting up back offices [in Palestine] for development for all sorts of new companies and even apps that are now growing in the Gulf, because Saudi has been growing so quickly on the tech front. Nvidia, and other international companies, has outsourcing operations in Palestine. Apple has outsourcing operations, Microsoft has R&D, and they would even like to see those expand. There\u2019s companies that had 200 developers sitting in offices in Ramallah,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to all of the heads of these different offices; most of them are in in Israel. They are very positive people who want to try to support the tech industry there and those efforts have been working well and growing,\u201d he added.\n\nIndeed, one of the main Palestinian VC funds, Ibtikar, had recently raised its second fund of $30 million.\n\nHigh-growth companies emerging from Palestine include Mena Analytics (data analytics, invested in by Flat6Labs); Olivery (last-mile logistics, Flat6Labs, Gaza Sky Geeks Ibtikar Fund); Coretava (employee and customer loyalty); and SellEnvo (an Amazon fulfillment partner).\n\nSturgill said that as well as the intensely difficult conditions in Gaza, which is being hit by Israeli missiles, the situation in Ramallah is \u201csuper tense. I feel like the situation is going to get significantly worse there over the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nIliana Montauk, co-founder and CEO of Manara \u2014 a social impact startup funded by Y Combinator, Seedcamp, Reid Hoffman, Eric Ries, Marc Benioff, Paul Graham, and Jessica Livingston, among others \u2014 told TechCrunch via email that connectivity has decreased significantly in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThough Gaza has been bombed many times before, this time is completely different for the tech sector for several reasons. Electricity was cut off to the entire [Gaza] strip. A significant amount of infrastructure has been bombed (including both ISPs and many tall apartment buildings that hold cell phone towers). Entire middle-class neighborhoods are being destroyed.\u201d\n\nShe said in the past if an entire neighborhood got destroyed, it was usually one bordering Israel and a poorer area, thus less impacting the tech sector.\n\n\u201cThe tech sector is almost completely unable to function in Gaza right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people are in too much danger to be able to work; some have evacuated three times in the past 24 hours, moving from friend\u2019s house to family house, because each neighborhood they end up in is the next one being bombed. They usually receive warnings to evacuate their homes 10 minutes before a bombing, so they don\u2019t sleep and monitor the situation constantly ready to evacuate in a minute\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cMost people have lost cell phone connections and internet access completely, or have some access to 2G only on their cell phones. Electricity is no longer being provided even for a few hours a day now, and people are running out of gas for their generators,\u201d she added.\n\nManara has around 100 software engineers in Gaza, some working remotely for tech companies in Silicon Valley/Europe.\n\nMontauk said one software engineer who works at Upwork disappeared for several days, until being found alive.\n\nDalia Awad, whose Medium post about getting into Google from Gaza went viral in 2021 (it was at one point #1 on Hacker News and tweeted by Paul Graham), returned to Gaza after her internships at Google and Datadog to graduate from university. She had a full-time job offer at Datadog in Paris but decided to stay home in Gaza and look for a remote job so she could be close to family.\n\nOn Tuesday she wrote to Montauk, saying: \u201cTonight was the worst night ever. My family and I are good, thankfully. The bombing was everywhere and we couldn\u2019t know where it was because there was no internet. Many of my friends lost their houses in the Rimal area. There is no wifi internet, we connect to the cellular data on our phones but it\u2019s only 2G and it connects for a few minutes then cuts off. We can only send Whatsapp messages. So we can\u2019t really read news on social media. In the morning we saw these videos from our friends who shared it on whatsapp but it takes FOREVER to download a video of a few seconds.\u201d\n\nMontauk said Awad had not responded to her in the past day.\n\nMontauk, a former director of Gaza Sky Geeks, said: \u201cBefore this escalation, the Gaza tech scene was growing. I was just in Riyadh and met companies that hire entire software development teams in Gaza. Upwork and other Silicon Valley companies are now hiring software engineers remotely from Gaza. In addition, some had left to work abroad at companies like Google, Amazon, Qualtrics, etc. Last time I was in Gaza a year ago, almost everyone I talked to asked me how they could get a job and leave Gaza. They were worried about more bombings and wanted to bring their children up in a place without such a high risk. These people just want to live normal lives.\u201d\n\nThose who are living in the West Bank say the activity in Gaza has had an inevitable impact.\n\n\u201cFor a Palestinian young woman like me living in the West Bank, I can confirm that there has been a noticeable freeze in terms of activity,\u201d said Leen Abubaker of Flow Accelerator and co-founder at Sawaed19. \u201cTech companies are either operating on a very limited scale, with employees struggling to reach their offices in the West Bank due to unsafe roads blocked by Israeli occupation forces and settlers, or they have been forced out of business entirely in Gaza.\u201d\n\nShe added that a number of buildings in Gaza that are key to the tech industry there, such as Burj Al-Watan, had been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and that the tech industry is not the first priority for people in the urgent situation. \u201cHow can you possibly detach from the distressing reality and cling to the remaining shreds of hope for your business?\u201d\n\nMohammad Alnobani is a Palestinian founder of The Middle Frame, an Arab stock image platform powered by AI tools that aims to shatter stereotypes about the Arab world through images and reducing bias in AI.\n\nHe told me he was on his way back from the One Young World Summit in Belfast, speaking about peace and reconciliation, and about to reach the borders to cross to Palestine to get back to his family, when the war broke out.\n\n\u201cThe borders closed down and I had to turn around and go back to Jordan,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still there, continuously checking on my family in Jerusalem, and trying to reach out to my connections in Gaza.\u201d His co-founder, Raya Fatayer, is in Ramallah, staying at home with her baby and husband, not able to travel.\n\n\u201cOur fellow entrepreneurs in Gaza had their homes demolished by air strikes, some we can\u2019t even reach anymore since the electricity is out and they have no power,\u201d he said. \u201cDealing with the situation while trying our best to move forward with our work is a daily challenge.\u201d\n\nHe said this outbreak of hostilities with Israel is clearly different: \u201cBefore, every time Gaza faced air strikes, we knew that certain areas were almost safe. Clearly today, nobody is safe.\u201d\n\n(This piece was later edited to include relevant information about the attacks by Hamas)."

    "body": "When British prime minister Rishi Sunak appeared in front of the hastily assembled press on September 20, the letter-crammed slogan on his lectern caused the country to squint: \u201cLong-term decisions for a brighter future,\u201d it read.\n\nWe now know, of course, there was little in the speech that followed that brought hope. Certainly not concerning the technological fight for our future climate.\n\nNot that long ago, the UK seemed a rather brighter beacon in the industrial transition toward reversing the global climate breakdown. The countrywide goals were laid out. COP26 at least offered a forum and a spotlight. London has made strides in establishing itself as a hub for green tech startups. On the narrow but viable path toward net zero, leaders were at least taking the right steps.\n\nThen came the nadir of the last few weeks.\n\nLast week, with the government\u2019s already infamous U-turn on its green pledges, the nation joined in a consternated chorus with global leaders to lament the prime minister\u2019s short-sighted choice. Sunak has pushed back the British net-zero transition timeline by at least five years.\n\nThe first and most galling concern is, obviously, the consequences for the future of our species on this planet. The next biggest issue, currently being voiced by leaders across industries and especially within the climate tech and climate finance sectors, is the message it sends out to those of us in the trenches actually trying to build technology to change the world and enable a sustainable future.\n\nThat message is loud and clear: The U.K. government isn\u2019t willing to be consistent when it comes to climate crisis response policy, which, aside from capital and the support of nascent tech markets, is one of the most critical things anyone in our sector can hope for.\n\nFor entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses to thrive and unlock the economic potential that comes from creating new industries, we need a consistent approach from the government.\n\nI care about this because, as Americans who chose to build a biocatalyst engineering company here in the U.K., we\u2019re acutely aware of the impact such a reversal of policy has on every stage of our sector\u2019s existence. All major technological innovation ultimately comes from government support at the very beginning. We wouldn\u2019t have affordable solar panels, microchips, mobile phones or the internet without government funding, government subsidies, government encouragement and government infrastructure. You can\u2019t scale technology that is going to make a considerable impact without upfront capital to match.\n\nIn January of this year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt unveiled a long-term vision to grow the economy, saying, \u201cI want the world\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, life science innovators and clean energy companies to come to the U.K. because it offers the best possible place to make their vision happen.\u201d Unless his long-term vision was only meant to last until the end of the summer, for entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses to thrive and unlock the economic potential that comes from creating new industries, we need a consistent approach from the government.\n\nWe have enormous fiscal potential. Within the U.K. climate tech community, we are working to create high-paying jobs and value for investors across just about every asset class. And collectively \u2014 hell, individually \u2014 our solutions could genuinely change the world.\n\nOf course, this is the common cause we should be united around. Our company is trying to move industry away from a reliance on fossil fuels to make chemicals, among other things. But the impact of these political spasms and contradictions in our climate commitments has on, say, an EV battery business \u2014 which has just seen the market demand for its output slide down the road by five years \u2014 isn\u2019t hard to appreciate. If giants like Ford are feeling the frustration, imagine the mood at a small green tech startup.\n\nSo what\u2019s the play? How can the government support those striving against an increasingly insecure (and insincere) backdrop?\n\nThe response of any tech company impacted by last week\u2019s news surely has to be this.\n\nFirst, we need a consistent macroeconomic policy. This has a major impact on startups raising and deploying capital into climate R&D. The global economic contraction has made it difficult for these businesses to raise any money. Overall approaches to the economy have trickle-down effects on how we, as businesses, make money and run our operations. Right down to salaries, which alone are hard to keep up with inflation-based pay rises.\n\nThe second is a consistent tax policy. One of the most critical things for startups is research and development (R&D) tax credits. This was a lifeline that gave small, research-intensive companies months of budget runway every year, as it effectively saw them get a third of the money spent in R&D back. The government announced it would be scrapping that last year, and it is only thanks to a lobbying effort spearheaded by the Startup Coalition that, at the last minute, a portion of that tax credit was able to be preserved.\n\nWhich leads to the third and most important point: A consistent climate policy. The impact of not having one is playing out in real time, right now. Sunak\u2019s public U-turn doesn\u2019t just undermine science and play into the hands of the climate skeptics. It also plows headlong into the future of any climate tech company whose launch plans have to be aligned around decarbonization timelines. This will damage economic confidence. People will lose jobs. And action, alas, will be further delayed.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s simple: Inconsistency breeds uncertainty. So give us consistency. It is possible for our sector to succeed in spite of bad policies. But to thrive, we need consistent resolutions and behavior from a government that actually cares about leading in this critical fight. Given the colossal stakes, which were at least recently taken seriously, is that really asking too much?"

    "body": "Discounts on Apple products are few and far between. Luckily, with Amazon's second big sale event of the year (officially called Prime Big Deal Days), we've found a variety of Prime Day Apple deals. That includes iPads, Apple Watches, iPhone cases, and MagSafe accessories. These deals aren't just at Amazon either\u2014we've linked to other retailers like Best Buy when available.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals\n\nUpdated October 11: We added new deals on the Apple Magic Keyboard, Apple Studio Display, ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set, Monoprice Extra Wide Microfiber Desk Mat, and Apple AirTags.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe test products year-round and independently recommend the best. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\niPad Deals\n\nIf you'd like more info, check out our Best iPads guide for an overview of every iPad model.\n\niPad Photograph: Apple\n\nThe ninth-generation iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best iPad for most people in our Best iPad guide. It's affordable (even without this discount) and packs a bunch of great features, including a 12-megapixel rear camera with support for Center Stage (which keeps you in the frame during video calls), 64 GB of storage on the base model, a True Tone display that adjusts the color temperature to match the ambient lighting in your environment, and a physical Touch ID-enabled home button. And since it's the same shape and size as its predecessors, all current accessories will work\u2014like the first-generation Apple Pencil and Apple's Smart Keyboard. If you need cellular connectivity, the 4G LTE model is also on sale at Amazon for $379 ($21 off).\n\niPad Air Photograph: Apple\n\nWe recommend the iPad Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) as an upgrade over the iPad (9th Gen). It packs a 10.9-inch LCD screen, a USB-C port, slim bezels, Touch ID built into the top power button, and the same M1 processor as the 2020 MacBook Air. It also has support for both the second-generation Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard Cover, and Magic Keyboard Cover. It dipped lower to $460 in July, but we still think this is a solid deal.\n\niPad Pro Photograph: Apple\n\nApple's iPad Pro tablet (7/10, WIRED Review) packs incremental upgrades compared to its predecessor, but it's the best option if you want the ultimate iPad. The large, 12.9-inch LCD screen comes equipped with ProMotion (which offers a 120-Hz screen refresh rate for smoother scrolling), Face ID, four speakers for better sound quality, and more microphones to pick up your voice more clearly. It also packs an M2 chip (the same one powering the MacBook Air and Mac Mini) and an exclusive Hover Mode for the second-gen Apple that allows you to see a preview of what your stylus will do when you hover over the screen.\n\niPad Mini Photograph: Apple\n\nThe iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our go-to tablet for travel. It's small enough to slip into my backpack and fits perfectly on an airplane tray table. With an 8.3-inch display, it's great for watching movies or reading ebooks, as well as sketching and taking notes with the second-generation Apple Pencil. Equipped with an A15 Bionic processor (the same chip powering the 2021 iPhone 13), it can handle taxing apps and games with ease. It should have enough power to last you for many years. It's worth noting Apple is rumored to be launching a next-gen version soon, but this is still a solid tablet if you don't need the latest and greatest.\n\nMacBook and Accessory Deals\n\nRead our Best MacBooks guide for more info and other options.\n\nApple MacBook Air Photograph: Apple\n\nThe M1-powered MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite budget MacBook. It's a few years old by now, but it's still one of the most powerful laptops you can buy for this price. It's fast and light and can make quick work of simple office tasks. It also has an improved keyboard (the one that doesn't break). The Air can handle some light video editing if the need arises, but if you need more power, spring for one of the newer, beefier options.\n\nMacBook Pro Photograph: Apple\n\nWe really only recommend this MacBook Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) if you want the touch bar. It does have the same M2 chip as the 13-inch MacBook Air (our top pick in our Best MacBooks guide), but it still comes with the same 13.3-inch display, 720p webcam, and two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. Performance is great, and there's reliable battery life, but we don't suggest it for processor-intensive workloads.\n\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\n\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first large-screen option within the Air family. It packs all the same features as the 13-inch MacBook Air including a redesigned chassis, 1080p webcam, and M2 chip\u2014while still maintaining a lightweight and thin design. It's an excellent option for those who spend all day working off a laptop and don't want to plug into an external monitor.\n\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\n\nApple Studio Display Photograph: Apple\n\nThe Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\n\nIf you're constantly working on the go, a portable monitor is a great way to get more screen real estate. This one from Mobile Pixels attaches to your laptop screen using magnets (you'll have to be comfortable with sticking and leaving adhesive magnets on the back of your laptop) and connects via a USB-C cable. Simply slide it out to reveal a 13-inch display. It adds some bulk and thickness to your laptop, but you can remove it when it's not in use.\n\nWe love this laptop stand for those who prefer working from your bed or couch. The stand's height isn't adjustable, but you have the option to raise the base to position it at the best angle for typing, watching a movie on a tablet, or sketching. There's also extra space for your coffee mug and a small drawer for storing knickknacks.\n\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub Photograph: Twelve South\n\nWe've used this hub with iPads, but it's also great for MacBooks. Plug it in via the USB-C port on your laptop and you'll have access to another USB-C port for passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI output, and a headphone jack. It's also fairly compact and thin, so it won't add to much bulk to your laptop.\n\nThis is the runner-up to the aforementioned Twelve South StayGo Mini in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. With support for up to three displays at once (either DisplayPort or HDMI for each), it's an excellent choice for anyone using multiple monitors to get work done. The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. All you have to do is plug in your MacBook for a multi-monitor setup instantly. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can also the dock to charge your laptop as well. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nWe recommend Satechi's 108-watt wall charger if you own a MacBook Pro. It comes with three USB-C ports, each with the ability to charge at 100 watts if only one device is connected (making it perfect for the 16-inch MacBook Pro). But if you want to charge three gadgets simultaneously, it'll charge them at 45, 30, and 30 watts, respectively, 58, 30, and 20 watts, or 65, 20, and 20 watts, depending on what you're charging. It's also on the larger side, but it's not as big as the one from Apple, and the plug folds up too.\n\nSatechi 165-Watt GaN Four-Port Charger Photograph: Satechi\n\nThis handy charger has enough power to juice up two MacBook Pro models simultaneously. But it's also great if you have a lot of devices around your desk that constantly need to be charged. It has a little stand to prop it up, a short cord that goes out to an outlet, and four USB-C ports that output 100 watts each. It dipped lower to $90 back in July, but this is still a great deal.\n\nWe've featured this deal a few times during previous shopping holidays. It's still a good one. This tablet stand is included in several WIRED guides, including the Best iPad Accessories and the Best Work-from-Home Gear. The stand is lightweight, portable, and easy to use.\n\nApple Watch and Strap Deals\n\nRead our Best Apple Watch and Best Apple Watch Accessories guides for more.\n\nApple Watch SE Photograph: Apple\n\nIf you don't need all the extensive capabilities that come with the Apple Watch Series 9, then the second-generation Apple Watch SE is a great option for most people. It can still track important health and fitness features, and with the latest S8 chip, you'll also get the redesigned Compass app and Crash Detection. It has support for WatchOS 10 too, so you don't have to worry about missing out on the latest software updates. This is the lowest price we've tracked yet. The larger 44-mm version is also on sale for $229 ($50 off).\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2 Photograph: Apple\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old but it's already on sale. It's our favorite smartwatch for outdoor sports. It packs a new (and bright) 3,000-nit display, the latest S9 chip for faster processing, and the new ultra-wideband chip for precision-locating your phone. As with last year's version, it also comes equipped with a useful Action button and the three-mic array. It's a great option if you're heavily into outdoor sports and are looking for a rugged, full-functioning smartwatch to take along with you. It's also the Apple Watch with the best battery life thanks to its massive size.\n\nApple Silver Milanese Loop Photograph: Apple\n\nThe Silver Milanese Loop band is a great metal band for when you're not using your Apple Watch for workouts. It's made from stainless steel, the thin mesh is extremely flexible, and the magnetic clasp makes it easy to adjust the sizing. This deal applies to the 41-mm size in silver and graphite, but the 45-mm band is also on sale.\n\nThis is the best band for the Apple Watch Ultra in our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide. It's made from an elastomer with a titanium buckle. We specifically like that it's stretchy, bright, and fits small wrists. The band is also easy to wash and shows dirt much less easily than the fabric bands. It's compatible with the large 45-mm Apple Watch Series 8 as well.\n\nWe like this microfiber mat since it keeps your desk looking nice and clean, and doubles as a giant mousepad. It's pretty minimalist and only comes in black, but at this sale price that's all we need.\n\nEarbud and Headphone Deals\n\nRead our Best Wireless Earbuds guide for more.\n\nAirPods Pro Photograph: Apple\n\nThe latest version of the AirPods Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was just announced last month at Apple's hardware event and they're already on sale. These buds are identical to the old pair on the outside, but they pack some changes internally. In addition to slightly improved sound, there are also new Adaptive Audio features and a new Conversation Awareness mode (that turns audio down and lowers the sound of the background so you can hear someone talking to you). The version with the Lightning port is currently out of stock, but who wants those anyway?\n\nThe Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones (7/10, WIRED Review) pack excellent calling and noise canceling, good sound quality, and fantastic wireless range. They also offer a stable fit and compact design. These headphones are missing a few key features though, including sensors for auto-pause and multi-band EQ. But with improved sound quality and ANC, along with a few cool extra features for both Android and Apple devices, these are still a solid option\u2014especially if they're on sale. This is the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nBeats Fit Pro Photograph: Beats\n\nThe Beats Fit Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) deliver a comfortable fit, great sound, and seamless integration with both iOS and Android. They also feature active noise canceling and decent mics. Equipped with Apple's proprietary H1 headphone chip, they work like AirPods when used with an iPhone. These work great on Android too\u2014complete with an app that allows you to perform a fit test and customize the controls. They dipped to $125 back in August, but this is still a good deal.\n\nWIRED associate editor Parker Hall says the Studio Buds fit better than most buds he's ever tried. He also likes that they have extremely useful physical buttons on the outside to play and pause audio as well as control noise cancelation. They'll also stay put in your ears even when breaking a sweat and sound as good as Apple's AirPods Pro. This is the same price we saw on Prime Day in July, but it's also the lowest the price has dipped.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro Photograph: Beats\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2019, but these are still our top recommendation for earbuds with the most secure fit\u2014making them an excellent option for the most intensive workouts. With an IPX4 water-resistance rating, they'll also stay protected from sweat. They have excellent sound quality and offer an impressive nine hours of battery life (with an extra 18 hours in the case). It's worth noting that many of the features won't work with an Android phone, but the core functions will.\n\nApple Charger Deals\n\nCheck out our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers and Best MagSafe Power Banks guides for more.\n\nAnker 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Cube Photograph: Anker\n\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\n\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\n\nThis is another excellent and compact 3-in-1 wireless charger from Anker. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\n\nBelkin 3-in-1 Wireless Charger Photograph: Belkin\n\nThis is currently our favorite Apple 3-in-1 wireless charger. The T-shaped design is compact, so it won't take up that much space on your nightstand or desk, and the charging tree suspends two of your devices midair. You can use it to charge your iPhone (at the fastest 15-watt charging speed Apple allows), fast-charge the Apple Watch Series 7/8/9/Ultra, and use the base to charge your AirPods Pro (or AirPods with a wireless charging case) simultaneously all from a single outlet. It's normally around $150 but was discounted to $100 in August, so it's possible that Prime Day won't be your last opportunity to snag it for less.\n\nAnker MagGo 637 Photograph: Anker\n\nAll you have to do is stick your iPhone to this adorable little orb and it'll start charging. On the back, you'll also find two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets. It's both cute and tidy. It fluctuates in price very often, but it's still a good deal.\n\nSatechi's fold-up wireless charging stand has a 10,000-mAh capacity (complete with LEDs to show you how much juice you have left) and can wirelessly charge both your phone and a wireless earbuds case (as long as it's Qi-certified). There's also a USB-C port to power up a third device. The only gripe we have is that it's slow\u2014delivering 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts via the USB-C port.\n\nApple 35-Watt Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter Photograph: Apple\n\nApple's dual USB-C port power adapter is an essential accessory if you have a tendency to forget to pack chargers for your devices on the go. With two USB-C ports, you can use it to recharge both your iPhone and MacBook simultaneously. Rated at 35 watts, it's also powerful enough to recharge an iPad Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nThe MagSafe Duo makes for an excellent travel companion if you own an iPhone and an Apple Watch. Rather than packing separate chargers, the MagSafe Duo combines chargers for both all within a compact, foldable form factor. You can also use it to charge your AirPods (if it comes with a wireless charging case) and other Qi-certified devices.\n\niOttie Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Car Dash Mount Photograph: iOttie\n\niOttie's Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Charger is great for those who prefer a mount on your dash or windshield and have an iPhone 12 or later. The suction cup attaches to a dashboard pad or windshield and proved secure in our testing. The telescopic arm (combined with a ball joint) also delivers a wide range of movement to help you find the ideal position. Unfortunately, it maxes out at 7.5 watts for charging, but you can remove the USB-C charging cable when the iPhone is fully charged. There's also a built-in fan to help keep the temperature down when it's hot out.\n\nAnker Nano USB-C Power Bank Photograph: Anker\n\nThis is a great power bank if you don't want to worry about carrying a cable around, since it simply slots into the bottom of your phone\u2014thanks to the built-in rotating USB-C or Lightning connector (MFi certified). It also offers 5,000 mAh of energy, and there's a USB-C port for recharging it, complete with a short cable. However, it might not be a good pick if you have a thick case.\n\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\n\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\n\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\n\nNomad's wireless charger is one of our favorite MagSafe wireless chargers. It delivers the maximum 15-watt charging speed possible, but it's not meant to be held up while you use the phone. It doesn't have a power adapter but includes a USB-C-to-USB-C cable. It'll sit securely on your desk and can charge an Apple Watch, too.\n\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. Unfortunately, it doesn't support fast charging and it's capped at 7.5 watts and 5 watts for the iPhone and Apple Watch, respectively. But it's a good, affordable charger. It dipped a little lower to $40 back in July, but this is still a solid deal.\n\nPhone Cases and Accessory Deals\n\nBe sure to read our Best MagSafe Accessories and Best iPhone 15 Cases guides for other picks.\n\nPhotograph: iOttie\n\nWhat we like best about this phone mount is that you can use it one-handed. The arms automatically close around the phone when you place it against the trigger button. To remove it, press the release bars. There's also a telescopic arm and ball joint that allows you to tweak the placement and set an ideal angle. We also love the clever magnetic tab that attaches the charging cable to the back of the mount, to keep from having to fish around for it. Plus, it's super sturdy\u2014even on bumpy roads.\n\nIf you're tired of people glancing over at your display in public, the Glass Elite Privacy 360 will block anyone from seeing content on your screen from the sides. It also feels great and is fairly easy to apply. Our only gripe is that Zagg's screen protectors are expensive. This has hit as low as $24, but it's a solid deal if you're in need of a screen protector sooner rather than later.\n\nCasetify Case Photograph: Casetify\n\nCasetify offers an overwhelming variety of case designs, but they can get pricey. So, if you've been eyeing one, we suggest taking advantage of the storewide sale. We like the Impact MagSafe cases, which have chunky bumpers and edges to protect the screen and are also made of plant-based materials as well as upcycled Casetify cases. The Bounce case is another solid choice that feels more rugged, but they're quite bulky. It's worth noting the sale doesn't apply to iPhone 15 products.\n\nOtterBox Figura Photograph: Otterbox\n\nWe like OtterBox cases, and many are 20 percent off, including chargers, cables, and other accessories. We've got recommendations in our iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 case guides.\n\nCase-Mate Blox Photograph: Case-Mate\n\nIf you're looking for a trendy case, look no further than this blocky and rectangular one. The bright neon color makes the phone pop, and it also looks super unique. Aesthetics aside, it's also a fairly well-rounded case. The cutouts are all accurate, the buttons are great, and it comes with MagSafe support. We tested this case with the iPhone 14, but this one is for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nPhotograph: Apple\n\nApple AirTags are our favorite Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users. This isn't a crazy sale, but getting these in a bundle of four means you can keep track of every set of keys, your luggage for a trip, or even your kids' backpack all at once.\n\nThose with an iPhone 14 or earlier can never have too many Lightning cables. These cables from Nomad are durable, available in different lengths, and come with the choice between USB-C and USB-A for the other end.\n\nRetailer Sale Pages"

    "body": "The Power Ministry has scheduled tenders of around 50 GW annually of renewable energy for the next five years, to achieve the target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity. Alongside the government\u2019s thrust on ramping up renewable energy capacity, building incremental thermal capacity has also been a priority. This is because energy security has become an important issue with consistent increase in demand in recent years; power demand is now at all-time high/peak levels.\n\nPSU thermal major NTPC appears to be well-placed to capture both themes \u2014 energy transition and energy security.\n\nSince our accumulate rating on NTPC in bl.portfolio dated August 13, 2023, the stock has gained around 48 per cent. This has been majorly on account of growth in earnings as well as re-rating in the stock from the trailing P/E of around 10 times then, to 12 times now. During FY23, the company\u2019s revenue increased by around 32 per cent. While there was flattish growth in PAT during the period on account of increase in fuel cost, the same grew nearly 30 per cent YoY in H1FY24. NTPC is now trading at a one-year forward P/E of around 11 times, which is around 35 per cent higher than its historical five-year average P/E of around 8.2 times.\n\nThe re-rating in the stock has happened mainly due to company-specific and industry-level structural positives (which justify current premium to historical average) and the company\u2019s aggressive capacity addition plans. We maintain our postive stance on NTPC and investors can continue to accumulate the stock on account of growth plans in place, along with the strong revenue and earnings visibility due to assured return model. Further, it is offering a decent dividend yield of around 3 per cent.\n\nBusiness\n\nNTPC earns majority of revenue from sale of power generated from thermal-based generating stations. More than 90 per cent of its revenue is tied to long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) under cost-plus based tariff regime, which ensures pass-through of costs such as plant capacity charge, supplementary capacity charge (emission control system cost), interest on loan, interest on working capital and energy cost (fuel) and allows ROE (Return on equity) of 15.5 per cent over and above these costs.\n\nThe complete recovery of capacity charges is allowed when the plant shows technical availability (plant availability factor) over and above the normative level i.e. typically 85 per cent wherein the plant should be technically available to generate power with sufficient coal in place. However, do note that pass-through is allowed subject to normative parameters and provisions defined in the PPA.\n\nNTPC has assured coal supply, given its long-term fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) for supply of coal for 20 years for total Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of 183 MTPA. Further, the company has captive coal mining with capacity of 71 MMT.\n\nRecent performance\n\nDuring H1FY24, the company reported PAF (plant availability factor) in its coal-based generation stations to the tune of 93.32 per cent as against 92.05 per cent in H1FY23. Further, PLF (Plant Load Factor) i.e. capacity utilisation for the period has been 76.62 per cent against 77.27 per cent in the last year and national average of 68.75 per cent. The company reported a YoY increase in generation of around 4 per cent, reaching 212 billion units (BUs) in H1FY24. Coal supply during H1FY24 was 113 MMT, including 4 MMT of imported coal. The coal consumption during the corresponding previous period was 112 MMT, including 10 MMT of imported coal.\n\nThe company has reported flattish revenue growth in H1FY24 reaching close to \u20b988,058.44 crore. This has been on account of shutdown in certain plants due to repair work and grid restrictions, which is expected to improve, going forward, in the upcoming quarters, as per the management. The company saw a YoY growth of around 18 per cent in EBITDA reaching \u20b925,091 crore and thereby EBITDA margins expanded from 25 per cent to 29 per cent on a YoY basis. This has been mainly on account of lower fuel cost due to reduced share of imported coal. The imported coal price rose steeply in FY23, the pass-through of which might not have been allowed completely, which resulted in decline in margins in FY23.\n\nGrowth triggers in place\n\nNTPC plans to have 130 GW of installed power generation capacity comprising 60 GW of renewable energy from the current level of 3.3 GW. While this is quite a long-term target, in the near term, NTPC plans to add 15-16 GW of renewable energy by FY26. Currently, around 7.7 GW of RE capacity is under construction and 11 GW under different stages. Further, as all-time high peak power demand makes the case for having thermal-based capacity as an energy security, NTPC plans to add 10-11 GW of thermal-based capacity by FY26. The target for the same has been raised from 7 GW earlier. This will imply capacity growth during FY23-26 to the tune of 10-11 per cent CAGR from the current levels.\n\nThe management has given the guidance of capex to the tune of around \u20b928,373 crore for FY24. For FY25 and FY26 it will be on similar lines while capex will shoot up on account on growth in renewable-related capex post then as per the management.\n\nDuring our previous call, we highlighted that NTPC was attempting to monetise its stake in its renewable energy arm NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) by way of selling stake to a strategic partner. However, during Q1FY24 earnings call, management highlighted that the company is now looking to unlock value by way of IPO rather than onboarding strategic investor. However, the timeline is not yet certain as it will depend on market-based factors and within how much time substantial RE capacity is there on the ground.\n\nThe company has a D/E of around 1.24 times as on H1FY24 and can, on account of its stable business model, access debt at a cheaper rate as compared to private power generation companies. The reasonable D/E gives NTPC scope for further debt financing to fund its capex requirements."

    "body": "What would have been a historic deal to tackle a planetary crisis slipped out of reach at the eleventh hour. Even so, climate-vulnerable countries and environmental advocates scored some key wins with clean energy after heated climate negotiations wrapped up in the United Arab Emirates, a top oil- and gas-producing country.\n\nThis was the closest yet that countries have gotten to striking a global deal to phase out the use of coal, oil, and gas. But the summit was arguably still a home game for fossil fuel interests who threw their weight around the United Nations climate conference, called the 28th Conference of the Parties or COP28, where tens of thousands of delegates and activists from nearly every nation on Earth have gathered over the past two weeks to wrangle over the future of fossil fuels.\n\nNow that the dust has settled, these are some of the biggest decisions made in Dubai that could determine how we power our world in the future.\n\nThe beginning of the end for fossil fuels?\n\n\u201cThis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 countries came to the table pushing for an official agreement to \u201cphase out fossil fuels.\u201d Doing so would address a glaring omission in the 2015 Paris accord, which never actually mentions coal, oil, or natural gas despite being an international agreement to stop global warming. Alas, countries still aren\u2019t facing the root of the problem.\n\nBringing the deal to the finish line required nearly 200 countries to agree on the same language. Ultimately, draft language explicitly calling for the phaseout of fossil fuels was stricken from the final text of agreements brokered at this year\u2019s climate talks. What the world got instead is a weaker call for \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade.\u201d A landmark United Nations-backed climate report in 2018 found that countries need to cut their emissions nearly in half by 2030 to meet goals set in the Paris climate accord.\n\nThe final text also calls on countries to work toward \u201caccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.\u201d To be clear, every word in that phrase is pretty dirty. Coal of course is the most polluting fossil fuel, one reason why it\u2019s hard to ignore in a climate agreement. But a commitment to phase down its use is decidedly weaker than one to phase it out. It mirrors language in a recent letter addressed to participating governments from COP28 president Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber \u2014 who also happens to be the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\n\nThe UN\u2019s decision to hold the summit in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, wound up giving the fossil fuel industry unprecedented access. There were more fossil fuel lobbyists in Dubai than at any climate conference in the 28 years the United Nations has convened it. Industry representatives for fossil fuels outnumbered delegations from every country present at the talks except the United Arab Emirates and Brazil. Al Jaber even used his position as COP28 president to lobby for oil and gas deals with other governments, according to an investigation by the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting.\n\nEven so, there were hopeful signs last week when draft documents coming out of the conference included options to incorporate language that called on countries to phase out fossil fuel use (there was also an option not to include such a clause). Then the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sent a letter to its member states pressuring them to \u201cproactively reject any text or formula that targets energy i.e. fossil fuels rather than emissions.\u201d\n\nFollowing the letter, language that had previously called on countries to phase out fossil fuels vanished from subsequent draft texts. Backlash was swift. \u201cThis obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word,\u201d former US vice president Al Gore posted on X on Monday. \u201cCOP28 is now on the verge of complete failure.\u201d\n\nThat brings us back to the language coming out of COP28 to phase down unabated coal. Using the word \u201cunabated\u201d \u2014 whether for coal, oil, or gas \u2014 carves out a huge loophole for fossil fuels. It means that polluters can continue burning fossil fuels as long as they pair it with emerging technologies that capture greenhouse gas emissions (though typically not 100 percent of those emissions) that are still unproven at scale.\n\n\u201cThis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for ... given the overwhelming momentum among countries in support of a renewable energy package and a long overdue fossil fuel phase out, we needed a far more ambitious result.\u201d Andreas Sieber, associate director of policy and campaigns for environmental group 350.org, said in a statement before the draft agreement was finalized at the conference\u2019s closing plenary.\n\nClean energy on the rise\n\nEven though the lack of a clear plan to phase out fossil fuels is a blow to climate action, this isn\u2019t exactly a zero sum game. Solar and wind power are already cheaper alternatives to coal, oil, and gas in most of the world when it comes to meeting new electricity demand. Nearly all of the world\u2019s new electricity supply over the next few years is expected to come from renewable and nuclear energy, according to the International Energy Agency. The agency, which was initially founded to safeguard the world\u2019s fuel supply after the 1970s oil crisis, called a global transition to clean energy \u201cunstoppable\u201d earlier this year and forecast that demand for coal, oil, and gas would peak this decade.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, getting cleaner sources of energy online looks inevitable at this point. There were some notable new commitments on the clean energy front in the final texts coming out of COP28, too. It calls for the tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, something that more than 100 countries had already pledged to do while negotiations were taking place last week. Leading up to the conference, the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas polluters \u2014 the US and China \u2014 committed to working toward that goal together when each country\u2019s climate envoys met in California in November.\n\nThe science is clear\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of science underpinning these kinds of negotiations. The world, on average, is about 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution. That might not sound like much, but it\u2019s enough to drive more devastating hurricane and wildfire seasons, and suck drought-vulnerable places dry while displacing other communities faced with rising tides."

    "body": "U.K. femcare-turned-gynaecological-health startup, Daye, has expanded its tampon-based home screening service to add STI testing. The startup is billing this \u201cnon-invasive screening\u201d service for sexually transmitted infections as a \u201cworld first\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cSTI Diagnostic Tampon\u201d service uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing tech to detect the presence of pathogens. Daye is launching with the ability to test for five STIs \u2014 namely: Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomonas, mycoplasma and ureaplasma \u2014 which were selected because they are the most common STIs. But more tests are planned.\n\nThe move comes a year after the startup took the wraps off an ambitious push into gynaecological health \u2014 with the launch of a vaginal microbiome screening service. Daye tells TechCrunch it\u2019s had \u201cthousands\u201d of customers for that service \u2014 which is a little more complicated to engage with as samples need to be sent back along with an ice pack (and hopefully minimal postal delays) in order that the lab can detect live pathogens.\n\nThe STI test is simpler as the PCR test is looking for genetic material \u2014 dead or alive; this type of test doesn\u2019t distinguish \u2014 so the user just needs to pop their sample in the extraction solution provided before they post it off for analysis.\n\nDaye sells tampons for regular, menstrual use too, of course. But it\u2019s always been interested in doing more with the staple female hygiene product than just catching flow. Its signature product is a CBD-infused tampon for combating period cramps. Though it also sells a \u201cnude\u201d version (i.e. no CBD) \u2014 and that core offering is the basis for a growing range of vaginal- and sexual-health-screening services which repurpose the basic tampon as a novel sample collecting device.\n\nThe clever twist here is it makes what could be an intrusive test into something its customers are likely to be intimately familiar with \u2014 and literally as easy as inserting and removing a tampon.\n\nDaye didn\u2019t invent the idea of using tampons to test for STIs, as founder Valentina Milanova explained when we dug into its wider mission last year. U.K. university researchers pioneered menstrual tampon screening back in the 1990s. But Milanova is on a mission to expand the technique\u2019s use and utility \u2014 seeing it as a convenient way to help women learn a heck of a lot more about their own bodies from the comfort of their own bathrooms.\n\nThe startup also claims tampons make a better testing device than the swabs or other protocols a patient might be administered at a sexual health clinic or doctor\u2019s office since its test tampons collect more vaginal fluid and cover a larger surface area \u2014 so it contends this is both a more accurate way to STI test than a swab and more comfortable than a speculum.\n\nPCR testing, meanwhile, has gotten very familiar after the COVID-19 pandemic. Daye\u2019s STI test uses the same principle as this gold standard detection test for coronavirus \u2014 but in this case it\u2019s looking for trace (or more) amounts of genetic material from pathogens that cause STIs.\n\n\u201cThe specificity of PCRs ensures that false-positive results are reduced, providing a more reliable diagnosis,\u201d it suggests, also noting the test can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single sample. So full marks for convenience.\n\nMore convenience is coming, too, as it adds more tests, too: Daye says HPV is next on its list \u2014 an STI which has been linked to increased cervical cancer risk.\n\nAnother on its list to add \u201csoon\u201d is to offer GBS screening for pregnant patients. \u201cGBS is a common bacteria often carried in the intestines or lower genital tract. While usually harmless in adults, it can cause severe infections in newborns if transmitted during delivery. Testing pregnant women for GBS allows for the timely administration of antibiotics during labour, significantly reducing the risk of neonatal infections,\u201d Daye tells us.\n\nThe startup also plans to offer herpes screening for everyone down the line.\n\nThe STI testing service is being launched in the U.K. first \u2014 at a cost of \u00a399 a pop \u2014 with the US slated to get the service \u201csoon\u201d. Daye is also aiming to expand screening services elsewhere in Europe, saying it\u2019s currently working on building out an aftercare offering to support patients across the EU.\n\nHow does the STI testing service work? The user receives a test kit in the post and, after self administering a vaginal swab by inserting and removing the test tampon and then preserving their sample as instructed, they post it sample back to Daye\u2019s partner lab for analysis \u2014 getting results digitally, via Daye\u2019s app, in a few days.\n\nFor a further \u00a329 they can also get a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d consultation about their results with a nurse. Users who don\u2019t purchase this optional extra, but do test positive for an STI, will receive a free five minute call to walk them through their results and advise on next steps, per Daye.\n\nOne question we had is related to how sexual health clinics may routinely test for HIV when a patient attends \u2014 i.e. even if they\u2019re at the clinic for another sexual health worry. So if more people choose to adopt at-home testing for STIs, thanks to Daye\u2019s convenient alternative, they may be missing out on the chance to acquire important health info \u2014 since clinics or doctor\u2019s offices can often nudge an attending patient to take the opportunity to test more widely while they\u2019re there in person.\n\nAsked how it\u2019s mitigating this risk, Daye told us: \u201cWe enable our patients to book in-clinic appointments for HIV screening, and in the future, we may also expand to at-home blood testing for HIV. We ensure that our patients are well-educated on the risks associated with HIV and are reminded of the need for regular testing. We\u2019d like to play a meaningful role in destigmatising sexual health and provide medically-backed advice on the recommended cadence of screening.\u201d\n\nThe startup also gave us a breakdown of the main customers for its novel vaginal microbiome screening service a year+ on from that launch \u2014 saying there are three main groups:"

    "body": "Using cannabis during pregnancy may come with a higher risk of poor outcomes, such as babies being born small for their gestational age, a new study suggests.\n\nAmong pregnant people who use cannabis, the risks are the highest for those who use the drug in both the first trimester and later in gestation, as opposed to only the first trimester, according to the study, published Tuesday (Dec. 12) in the journal JAMA .\n\n\"What I think this study evaluates, that has not been evaluated previously, is whether the timing and amount of exposure matters, and what we saw was that higher levels of cannabis exposure were associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes,\" first study author Dr. Torri Metz , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Utah Health, told Live Science in an email. Using cannabis in the first trimester still carries risk, but the findings hint that stopping cannabis use within the first trimester could help prevent that risk from growing larger.\n\nNotably, the study reveals only a link between cannabis and certain poor pregnancy outcomes \u2014 it doesn't directly demonstrate that cannabis causes these effects. But it does suggest that \"cannabis use should be avoided during pregnancy to optimize maternal and neonatal [newborn] outcomes,\" the study authors wrote in the report.\n\nRelated: Eating just 2 cannabis gummies can put small kids at risk of toxic effects\n\nIn the study, the researchers screened frozen urine samples that had been collected from 9,200 pregnant people at eight U.S. medical centers. The participants were originally recruited between 2010 and 2013 for a long-term study on pregnancy outcomes and their samples have been stored since then.\n\nThe samples were taken during three time windows that respectively fell within the first trimester, the early second trimester, and the late second trimester into the third. For the new research, each sample was screened for a specific molecule that appears in urine when the body breaks down tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), the psychoactive compound in cannabis.\n\nIn addition, the researchers reviewed the participants' medical records to look at their pregnancy outcomes. They took note of preterm births, stillbirths and instances when a newborn was born small for their gestational age; \"small\" was defined as being below the fifth percentile for their age and sex. They also noted when the mother experienced pregnancy-related high-blood-pressure disorders, such as gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.\n\nThese outcomes have been tied to dysfunction of the placenta, the organ that supplies a growing fetus with nutrients and oxygen while removing waste from the womb. Research in monkeys has suggested that cannabis exposure can alter gene activity in the placenta, and it's also linked to reduced oxygen and blood flow through the organ. In humans , cannabis exposure has been linked to slower-than-typical growth of the fetus, which can be related to problems with the placenta.\n\nIn the study, urine screening flagged 610 participants who had used cannabis in pregnancy. Nearly 200 used cannabis only in the first trimester, while the rest tested positive for cannabis both in the first trimester and later in pregnancy.\n\nParticipants who used cannabis had a higher risk of experiencing at least one of the poor pregnancy outcomes \u2014 nearly 26%, compared with 17.5% in the group that didn't use cannabis. The risk was highest for those who used cannabis late into pregnancy, and the risk also appeared to rise with the overall concentration of THC byproduct in a person's urine.\n\nThe researchers initially considered the pregnancy outcomes as a group, rather than separately, because \"we knew we did not have a large enough sample to examine all of these outcomes independently,\" Metz told Live Science. But as a secondary analysis, the researchers then zoomed in on specific pregnancy outcomes, to see which were most common in the available data.\n\nIn that analysis, cannabis use was linked to a higher chance that a baby would be born small, but it was not linked to a higher risk of high-blood-pressure disorders in pregnancy.\n\nCannabis use was also tentatively linked to a risk of stillbirth, with the group that used cannabis showing a higher rate than those who didn't use the drug. However, in a model that adjusted for other influential factors \u2014 such as nicotine exposure and the mother's age and insurance status \u2014 the cannabis-related stillbirth result was no longer statistically significant.\n\n\"There are other studies that have also found an association between cannabis use and stillbirth , so it is concerning that we also saw this association in unadjusted analyses,\" Metz said. However, because the link disappeared in the adjusted model, \"this also means that we likely needed a bigger cohort to look specifically at stillbirth as an outcome.\"\n\nFortunately, based on the current study's data, \"stillbirth is a rare outcome,\" Metz emphasized. Its risk just warrants further study in larger groups.\n\nThe current study has other limitations. For instance, the molecules in the frozen urine samples may have degraded somewhat over the years, although they were stored appropriately. The way people used cannabis is also unknown, so it's unclear if inhaling or taking edibles would come with different levels of risk, for example.\n\nAnd again, the study's design allows a link to be drawn between cannabis and pregnancy outcomes, but it can't say whether or how the drug actually caused the outcomes.\n\nThat said, \"I think this lends more evidence to the idea that there are potential risks, and really talk to patients about alternative methods of treating whatever it is they're hoping to treat with cannabis,\" Metz told JAMA in a podcast interview ."

    "body": "Parenting no longer starts and stops with our children. Nor is it confined to those who have children. In a time of unrelenting change and ever-extending life, most of us will \u2013 at some stage \u2013 find ourselves \u201cparenting\u201d our own parents.\n\nIndeed, many of us \u2013 particularly those who had families later \u2013 will find ourselves simultaneously parenting our kids and our parents. In one breath we\u2019ll be begging our children to swap French fries for vegetables, and in the next breath we\u2019ll be urging our parents to exchange cake for sardines. Little wonder today\u2019s midlifers are known as the sandwich generation.\n\nThe relentless pace of technology \u2013 accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 has made everything infinitely more complicated, leaving many older (and not-so-old) people baffled and frustrated. In the last few years I\u2019ve witnessed friends and family dashing to help parents with poorly designed online banking systems, unruly fridge alarms, \u201cupgraded\u201d software that has changed beyond recognition, apps and phones that don\u2019t function as expected, and numerous other technical challenges.\n\nFrankly, technology is often baffling to me, too. Luckily I have kids who delight in parenting me \u2013 advising, explaining and guiding me on all things digital. But studies suggest that this helpfulness might not be as beneficial as we think. Grappling with new and baffling things forces the ageing brain to work in novel ways. A recent study from the University of Texas involving more than 200 elderly adults found that those who engaged with technology had better cognition and memory than their non-engaging peers.\n\nDigital engagement \u2013 whatever the device \u2013 protects the brain\n\nEven the stress we experience while battling with our computer can be helpful, sharpening our mental acuity. The study authors concluded that digital engagement \u2013 whatever the device \u2013 protects the brain. These findings reflect earlier studies that discovered that older people who made active use of technology were less likely to get dementia.\n\nDr Eamon Laird, researcher in health and ageing at Limerick university, agrees that we should be encouraging older parents to try new things. And the further out of their comfort zone they feel, the better. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to keep the mind active and fresh,\u201d he told me. \u201cNew challenges can help build and maintain new brain connections and can be good for brain and overall health.\u201d\n\nIf older people use technology to keep in touch with extended family and friends, that\u2019s a double whammy. When my 84-year-old mother recently joined Instagram, she not only expanded her grey matter but she also found an effective means of staying in touch with her grandchildren. Being social, says Laird, is as important as trying new things: \u201cResearch shows that those who are more social are also more resilient to chronic conditions and often have a stronger immune system.\u201d\n\nAnyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week Dr Eamon Laird, health and ageing researcher\n\nDepression among the elderly is on the rise and often goes unnoticed. Gerontologists now believe that it is one of the most common psychiatric disorders among the elderly \u2013 with half of all cases going undiagnosed. When elderly parents become depressed (many of them come from a generation not accustomed to talking about their mental health), it can be difficult to know how to respond. But Laird\u2019s latest report suggests that a daily walk could help. His study of more than 4,000 older adults found that as little as 20 minutes of daily walking could cut the risk of depression by up to 43%. \u201cAnyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week \u2013 and when they have a companion, the walk also doubles as a social occasion,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf they can walk for longer than 20 minutes, even better. Our study showed that the risk of depression fell in proportion to the time spent walking.\u201d\n\nAs well as a daily walk, Laird recommends vitamin D and B12 supplements \u2013 both of which appear to moderate the chance of depression in older people. \u201cDepression matters,\u201d he added. \u201cNot just because it reduces quality of life, but because in older people there seems to be a link between depression and dementia which we\u2019re still unpacking.\u201d\n\nHealth coach Susan Saunders found herself \u201cparenting\u201d her mother (who had dementia) while her own daughters were babies. \u201cI\u2019d advise anyone with a parent in the early stages of dementia to investigate all the available research trials. Start by joining Dementia Research, a nationwide register that matches volunteers to research programmes.\u201d\n\nEven if your parents don\u2019t require such intensive \u201cparenting\u201d, a simple supplement could help. A recent study from Columbia University involving 2,200 adults aged 60 and over found that an inexpensive multivitamin formulated specifically for older people improved cognition, memory and focus. In fact, the results were so marked that the researchers said the supplement could slow age-related memory decline by three years.\n\nBut while most of us can probably persuade our parents to take a multivitamin, suggesting they change their diet might be more complicated. Appetites fade as we age, chewing becomes more difficult and those living alone don\u2019t always feel inclined to cook. The important thing, say both Saunders and Laird, is that older people consume plenty of protein.\n\n\u201cOlder adults should be taking at least 1 to 1.5g of protein per kilogram of body weight,\u201d says Laird. \u201cDairy, fish or non-processed meat can help maintain muscle strength and function, reducing the risk of frailty as we age.\u201d\n\nIn truth, anyone over 50 would do well to follow these simple guidelines: engage with something new every day, take a daily walk of at least 20 minutes, socialise regularly, take a daily multivitamin for seniors and check the protein content of our meals. Perhaps we should think of it as self-parenting.\n\nGood groups for elders\n\nAge UK has a database of social activities and groups for older folk\n\nThe Walking Football Association keeps keen amateur footballers playing long into their 50s and 60s\n\nAction for Elders offers social and exercise programmes\n\nThe Centre for Ageing Better provides information on working and living as an older person\n\nu3a, a charity collective, provides local opportunities for people no longer in work to acquire new skills and knowledge\n\nAnnabel Streets is the co-author of The Age-Well Project: Easy Ways to a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life (Piatkus) and co-founder of The Age-Well Project"

Whether or not the universe breaks into song depends on which words of the title \u201cSuper Mario Bros. Wonder\u201d you prefer.\n\nIf you\u2019re here for the \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d of it all, this level (and every level) can be enjoyed as a loyal continuation of the plumber\u2019s work in the 2D platformer genre that has maintained a healthy and consistent cadence since the series debuted in 1985. Dash from left to right, jump over pits, concuss enemies, collect the occasional power-up, and after a few minutes of adventuring ever eastward, leap onto the flagpole that ends one level and unlocks the next.\n\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .\n\nBut, if you\u2019re curious about the \u201cWonder\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re not too precious about video game tradition \u2014 you can find within each Wonder stage a Wonder Seed, a Mario-sized ball of botany that morphs the environment into something indeed quite wonderful. Like a musical number.\n\nTo choose wonder is to flood the atmosphere with lava-lamp plasma, send gravity into convulsions, or transform your hero into any variety of creatures \u2014 or even inanimate objects. As my stoned college roommate once postulated while ripping an apple bong: \u201cYou always see the scenery, but have you ever wanted to be the scenery?\u201d Reader, he dreamt so we could live. For a moment, Mario gets to be the background.\n\nThe brilliance of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is that the choice is one of \u201cand,\u201d not of \u201cor.\u201d The traditional and the topsy-turvy coexist. Across six worlds, the creators of Wonder offer a menu of familiar stages that, should you like, can be prepared with extra spice \u2014 or paired with the family-friendly equivalent of ayahuasca. That particular drug comparison isn\u2019t flippant: At one point Toad licks the ol\u2019 Wonder Seed, and suddenly he\u2019s riding a dragon.\n\nWonder Seeds can add a splash of difficulty, but help is perpetually available in a fashion that\u2019s considerate rather than patronizing. Gone are time limits. Extra lives can be purchased at a low cost with the game\u2019s abundant purple currency. A new badge system allows players to select from a growing collection of special abilities that range from helpful (a high, floating leap) to playful (a Piranha Plant grappling hook) to silly (a triple jump tied to a musical rhythm).\n\nPrince charming Badges are worn by a little royal bug named Prince Florian who joins you on your journey and provides the majority of conversation on this road trip, alongside very talkative flowers sprouting across every corner of the Flower Kingdom, eager to provide a tip for a metatextual wink.\n\nEach unlockable upgrade or special move is assigned to a badge that can be found or purchased. One collected badge can be selected before each stage, so I found myself rotating abilities based on need. For example, when later stages added a bunch of instant-death bottomless pits, I opted for the Safety Bounce badge: When I plunge into an abyss, the darkness spits me up like a piece of hamburger caught in its throat.\n\nI expect many players will brag that their favorite badge is the \u201coverpowered one,\u201d which is sort of always true. No matter what you use, you will feel like you\u2019ve been given an unfair advantage as you casually float over chunks of the stage or vacuum coins through walls. To maintain balance, the designers layered on new challenges, keeping Wonder within the Goldilocks window. Not too hard, not too easy. Just right.\n\nThe wonder of playing Super Mario Bros. in 1985 came from the discovery. Nintendo not only predicted players would climb outside the confines of the level, it placed shortcuts in the hidden crevices to reward the most rule-breaking players. Badges cleverly build upon that sense of freedom with skills that let you soar over towering enemies or use that Piranha Plant grappling hook to climb high above the confines of the stage \u2014 now a Mario tradition.\n\nAnd sometimes Wonder goes further. With Wonder Seeds, the levels themselves collapse and contort, disobeying the laws established by decades of Mario games. Giant, sudsy, rainbow-tinted bubbles fill a stage and burst through the ceiling; a colossal snowball knocks down a flagpole, extending the stage beyond its official conclusion.\n\nThis is the most significant difference between 1985 and 2023: Mario\u2019s creators have joined in the fun of breaking the machine.\n\nPlay Mario for the first time a second time\n\nMiddle-aged Mario fans (read: me) have speculated since its announcement that Wonder could be the first \u201ctrue new Mario game\u201d since Super Mario World in 1990.\n\nTo younger (or just less obsessive) readers, that theory might sound strange. Nintendo has released many iterative entries of Mario \u2014 including the cheekily named New Super Mario Bros. series. However, for the village elders, the first four 2D Mario games stand apart.\n\nMario multiplayer Wonder shines as a solo experience, but like other recent 2D Mario games, Wonder allows up to four players to play together. Multiplayer is both a delight and utter chaos. The humanoid characters (Mario, Peach, Toad, etc.) are like M&Ms \u2014 they have different exteriors but effectively play the same. The critters are perfect for players who prefer a little extra help. Nabbit and Yoshi won\u2019t take damage, and the Yoshis have their familiar tongue attack and floaty jump.\n\nWith each Super Mario Bros. on the NES and SNES, Nintendo\u2019s designers learned from the previous entry, cutting what didn\u2019t work, making audacious additions (there was a time when adding a dinosaur named Yoshi felt like a gimmick!), and gradually accumulating the pieces and tropes that would appear in every game for the following 30-plus years.\n\nThen, with Super Mario 64, 3D Mario games became the de facto labs for Nintendo\u2019s greatest experimentation: Magical hats! Water guns! Galactic travel! 2D Mario, conversely, defaulted to a vessel for nostalgia.\n\nI can say with confidence that Wonder shares those early games\u2019 inventiveness, and their disregard for what should and shouldn\u2019t be in a Mario game. When playing Wonder, I\u2019ve imagined how it came to be: In my fantasy, since the \u201990s, every time a Nintendo developer had an idea that \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the tone\u201d or \u201cwasn\u2019t Mario enough,\u201d they wrote it into a notebook. And eventually, with no space left, someone had the gall to say, \u201cLet\u2019s turn this stuffed notebook of chaos into a game. Because why shouldn\u2019t Mario be an elephant? Why shouldn\u2019t Wigglers wear roller skates? And why shouldn\u2019t Luigi skydive?\u201d\n\nWonder\u2019s creators have so many new ideas to share that their creativity is unapologetically wasteful, which I say as a compliment. Many gimmicks in Super Mario Bros. Wonder could be stretched to fill entire games, but here, we\u2019re lucky to see them last a few minutes.\n\nFor example, one stage might feature platforms that drop when you step on them. The next stage will feature platforms that drop, but only after you\u2019ve jumped on them a certain number of times \u2014 a countdown clock at their center. After that, the stage will have platforms made of batteries, each dropping as it runs out of energy. And then, to wrap things up, there will be a stage in which you build the stage out of huge batteries of different shapes, the platform rapidly growing and shrinking as it skims above a yawning abyss.\n\nIn the current era of AAA \u201cforever games\u201d filled with endless lists of chores and artificial rewards, Wonder\u2019s willingness to juice each idea of its fun, then toss the rind in the trash, is a potent alternative. The reward isn\u2019t XP or limited-edition outfits. It\u2019s the play itself.\n\nDon\u2019t mistake the creative abundance (and refusal to wear out one\u2019s welcome) for a short game. Levels are everywhere. Wonder\u2019s map features six worlds, but levels can also be found in the hub area, along with... to avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say elsewhere. The familiar rhythms of a Mario game have been broken, with bosses appearing without warning, some worlds ending with no boss fight at all, and the occasional surprise stage that materializes like a mirage.\n\nWhether or not Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the unofficial Super Mario Bros. 5 that dorks like me have long wanted, I\u2019ll leave to the forums. But I will say this: What a joy it is to play a Mario game and not already know how to read it, to not have my muscle memory do more work than my brain.\n\nWith rumors that the Nintendo Switch\u2019s successor could arrive early next year, I would be fine if Wonder were this console\u2019s last big release. To survive after the Wii U, Nintendo had to bring together its console and handheld designers and create something unlike anything on the market, without sacrificing what had gotten the company to that point. As the sun sets on the Switch, after an unprecedented run of success, along with arguably the best entries in many of the company\u2019s biggest franchises, we get Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\n\nLike the Switch itself, Wonder is a collision between the traditional and the new. A game that\u2019s the same as it ever was and nothing like Mario has ever been.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder will be released Oct. 20 on Nintendo Switch. The game was reviewed on Nintendo Switch using a pre-release download code provided by Nintendo. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Let\u2019s run through some of your ideas and findings:\n\nYNAB is the big winner. YNAB, which stands for You Need A Budget, was the overwhelming most popular recommendation I got this week. Folks liked that you can sync all your accounts and cards, that it\u2019s an independent app you pay for instead of being bombarded by ads and credit card deals, and that it has a specific set of principles and systems you can just pick up and start using.\n\nYNAB, which stands for You Need A Budget, was the overwhelming most popular recommendation I got this week.

I assumed, as a famous person of letters, she would have an elaborate, possibly pretentious system \u2014 at least an especially fancy leather Moleskine. It turns out she just kept four different notebooks: cheap ones, sporting different Beatles album covers, each serving a different purpose. I forgot what each was for, but it was something like \u201cRevolver is for characters, Sgt. Pepper\u2019s is for plot.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if I was channeling Tartt when I decided to regularly use a rotation of five different writing apps. They are iA Writer, Google Docs, Bear, Apple Notes, and Scrivener, and they all have more weaknesses than strengths. Each feels like it\u2019s been designed for a fairly specific use case. But that\u2019s not really the point. I know that when I open iA Writer, it\u2019s to try and get words down as quickly as possible. Docs is for revising and fidgeting. Bear is for thoughtful notes. Notes is for garbage notes (I really hate that app, but it also syncs our household grocery list). Scrivener is its own beast, built from the ground up for real sickos (authors).\n\nI\u2019m sure five apps that do essentially the same thing sounds like a nightmare to some people. But for me, writing and editing is a messy process, like trying to capture lightning in a bottle. Or I guess, in this case, five different bottles.\n\nNon-writing apps: Wallet, Google Authenticator, Photos, Camera, Google Maps, Settings, Clock, Chase, Arc (the iOS app is fairly incomplete, but it will sync with your sidebar, so I\u2019ll open a bunch of tabs, then read those links on my phone when I get on the subway), Slack, Hello Weather (my salvation since the death of Dark Sky), Pins (I use Pinboard to save longform stories, and I meticulously tag them with the kind of notes you might expect from a features editor), Letterboxd (quietly the best social app and a great way to triangulate what\u2019s out, streaming, or in theaters \u2014 if two or three friends have all logged an older film recently, it probably means it just hit Criterion or there\u2019s a revival at IFC).\n\nAs always, I also asked Kevin to share a few things he\u2019s into right now. Here\u2019s what he sent back:\n\nSurround by Hiroshi Yoshimura . This recently released ambient record was originally made to be the music of\u2026 prefab homes? But it reveals so much on closer listen: shimmering drone, swirls of pleasing synths, a touch of humor. Still, if you\u2019re lazy like I am most days, you can just put it on while you work and let it wash over you.\n\nThis recently released ambient record was originally made to be the music of\u2026 prefab homes?

I\u2019m halfway through Ed Park\u2019s long-awaited second novel, and so far, it\u2019s a funny, genre-busting saga that is deeply obsessed with Korean history. For fans of anyone who is wanting a big, immersive read who is usually daunted by a big, immersive book.\n\nI\u2019m halfway through Ed Park\u2019s long-awaited second novel, and so far, it\u2019s a funny, genre-busting saga that is deeply obsessed with Korean history. For fans of anyone who is wanting a big, immersive read who is usually daunted by a big, immersive book. Anatomy of a Fall. I reviewed this courtroom thriller when it premiered at New York Film Festival, and now you can catch it in select cities. A dark, twisty murder mystery that surrenders itself to a much richer set of questions than your usual whodunit. The best thing in theaters at the moment! (And in general, I recommend going to the theater. Replace your screen time with the biggest-possible-screen time.)\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere\u2019s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you\u2019re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we\u2019ll feature some of our favorites here every week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a website called RetroAchievements that adds trophies to old-school games. It\u2019s a great excuse to go back and play games from your childhood or games you never got around to playing.\u201d \u2013 Nick\n\n\u201cFluttermind, the Moonring dev, hasn\u2019t ported the game to Mac yet, but I did discover some of their other games, and I\u2019ve started to play Spellrazor. It\u2019s a very interesting haunted arcade game.\u201d \u2013 Drake\n\n\u201cJust finished The Kids of Rutherford County, the new podcast from the Serial folks, and it was great. Reading Adam Grant\u2019s new book, Hidden Potential. Not done yet, but it\u2019s excellent so far, especially for someone like me who struggles with imposter syndrome.\u201d \u2013 Nick\n\n\u201cCastro, my favorite podcast app. I appreciate the way that it treats episodes more like emails so I can queue, save for later, or delete them individually. After using it, I can\u2019t move to any other podcast app.\u201d \u2013 Mike\n\n\u201cFound the show Detroiters. Really fun 30-minute comedy starring Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson, with their sensibilities.\u201d \u2013 Travi\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing a game called Chants of Sennaar right now, and it is unlike any other puzzle / logic game I have played. You wake up in a tower with different classes of people on each level, and they all speak different languages (and obviously, you don\u2019t know any of them). You try to learn each language through context from people or environment. It is super chill but challenging.\u201d \u2013 Bahadir\n\n\u201cI stumbled upon the Beli app for tracking and discovering restaurants, and it is by far the best option for that sort of thing, far better than a crowded Google Maps or noisy FourSquare. It has a lot of potential in its ability, and you get to keep discovering features as it learns about your preferences.\u201d \u2013 Rich\n\n\u201cI have recently gotten into the 60 Songs That Explain the \u201890s podcast. I am definitely not an early adopter here but am loving the deep dives on the songs paired with just the right amount of sarcasm and history.\u201d \u2013 Antek\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pumped for the finale of Scavengers Reign! Really enjoyed the season with fantastic planet symbiotic flora, Aeon Flux adult animation / themes, and not everyone is making it out alive.\u201d \u2013 BG\n\n\u201cFor over 15 years I have made a regular pilgrimage to Kriegs.net to check out the wallpaper that he puts out consistently by the start of the month. The design is usually themed to the season and comes with the option of a calendar in the image. I don\u2019t know if this is a widely known resource, but it has always felt like a little secret that only I know about, which I am now willing to share.\u201d \u2013 Jonathan\n\nSigning off\n\nThis weekend, pour one out for Tumblr, one of the most interesting social networks on the internet, which appears to be in trouble. It\u2019s not dying, but it\u2019s not\u2026 not dying, you know? Whatever happens next, this state of affairs is a bummer for a lot of reasons, including that Tumblr promised to work with ActivityPub \u2014 which would have been a big win for the fediverse \u2014 and I think is still maybe the web\u2019s best and most versatile posting tool. Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic (which owns Tumblr), spent a bunch of time this week answering people\u2019s questions about the future of Tumblr, and it paints a sad but interesting picture of what it really takes to build a better social network. It\u2019s all making me root for Mastodon even harder."

    "body": "Meta is to offer an ad-free subscription version of Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, confirming the core of a report in the WSJ earlier this month. The new ad-free subscription will be available from next month, per a Meta blog post.\n\nThe move follows years of privacy litigation, enforcements and court rulings in the EU \u2014 which have culminated in a situation where Meta can no longer claim a contractual right (nor legitimate interest) to track and profile users for ad targeting. (Although, at the time of writing, it is still doing the latter \u2014 meaning it is technically operating without a proper legal basis. But this summer Meta announced an intention to switch to consent.)\n\nUnder regional data protection law the only available basis left for Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling ad business is to obtain freely given consent from users. However the adtech giant\u2019s interpretation of free consent with this \u2018pay us or be tracked\u2019 subscription proposal will, justifiably, leave privacy advocates fuming \u2014 since the choice it\u2019s offering here boils down to \u2018pay us money; or pay us with your privacy\u2019.\n\nPer Meta\u2019s blog post, the fee it plans to charge users to escape its tracking and targeting (i.e. the ad-free subscription) is \u20ac9.99/month on web or \u20ac12.99/month on iOS or Android per linked Facebook and Instagram accounts in a user\u2019s Accounts Center. After March 1, 2024 it also says an additional fee \u2014 of \u20ac6/month on web and \u20ac8/month on iOS or Android \u2014 will apply for each additional account listed in a user\u2019s Account Center.\n\nSo the cost for using Meta\u2019s services without being tracked and profiled could quickly stack up for anyone with more than one account on Meta\u2019s social networks.\n\nEven for a user with just one account (on either Facebook or Instagram) the cost for protecting their privacy from Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling would be almost \u20ac120 per year (for web use) or just over \u20ac155 (on mobile).\n\nAs we reported earlier this month, Meta is relying on a line in a ruling handed down by the bloc\u2019s top court, the CJEU, earlier this year \u2014 where the judges allowed the possibility \u2014 caveated with \u201cif necessary\u201d \u2014 of an (another caveat) \u201cappropriate fee\u201d being charged for an equivalent alternative service (i.e. that lacks tracking and profiling). So the legal fight against Meta\u2019s continued tracking and profiling of users will hinge on what\u2019s necessary and appropriate in this context.\n\nnoyb, the European privacy rights group which has driven much of the strategic litigation against Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling, has already \u2014 since 2021 \u2014 been challenging similar \u2018pay or okay\u2019 practices by news publishers by filing a series of complaints with data protection authorities.\n\nIn a press release earlier this month after the WSJ reported Meta plans to charge users for their privacy, noyb\u2019s founder and honorary chairman, Max Schrems, wrote: \u201cThe CJEU said that the alternative to ads must be \u2018necessary\u2019 and the fee must be \u2018appropriate\u2019. I don\u2019t think \u20ac160 a year is what they had in mind. These six words are also an \u2018obiter dictum\u2019, a non-binding element that went beyond the core case before the CJEU. For Meta this is not the most stable case law and we will clearly fight against such an approach.\u201d\n\nContacted for a response to the development, Meta\u2019s lead regulator in the EU for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) sent us a statement. \u201cMeta notified the DPC on July 27 of its intention to implement an alternative, consent-based model in which users would be given a choice between ads-funded versions of its platforms, and subscription versions in which, in return for payment of monthly fee, it is said that users will not receive targeted advertising,\u201d the Irish regulator wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile February 2024 was initially identified by Meta as the earliest date by which its consent model would be operational, it agreed to bring forward that date to November 2023 at the direction of the DPC, the DPC having been concerned to ensure that changes would be implemented to the platforms as soon as practicable in light of earlier findings to the effect that Meta had failed to demonstrate its entitlement to rely on the legal bases on which it was then relying when processing users\u2019 data for behavioural advertising purposes. These included findings made by the Court of Justice of the European Union when delivering judgment on July 4, 2023 in a case in which the Court examined the legal bases on which Meta\u2019s processing of users\u2019 data for behavioural advertising purposes is grounded.\n\n\u201cActing in consultation with its fellow European supervisory authorities, the DPC has been engaged in a detailed regulatory assessment of the consent-based model since it was first proposed by Meta in July. That exercise is being led by the DPC, reflecting its position as Lead Supervisory Authority for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The exercise has not yet concluded, and no findings have been made to date. It is due to be completed shortly, at which point the DPC will notify Meta if it considers that the manner in which its new user offerings are to be implemented is compatible with Meta\u2019s obligations under GDPR.\u201d\n\nSo Meta\u2019s move to offer users a subscription or tracking hasn\u2019t been signed off by data protection authorities as yet \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that further regulatory interventions could follow. (And on that front, Norway\u2019s DPA, which has a local ban order on Meta\u2019s tracking ads, told us it\u2019s concerned about the subscription plan, saying it has doubts as to whether it would constitute valid consent.)\n\nAs well as needing to comply with the GDPR, which delineates the qualities necessary for consent to be legal (such as that it is specific, informed and freely given), Meta is now also subject to the pan-EU Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 which also sets conditions on larger platforms when it comes to tracking and profiling people for ads. So it won\u2019t just be data protection authorities making a call on whether Meta\u2019s subscription or tracking offer flies; the European Commission is responsible for oversight of very large online platforms\u2019 DSA compliance.\n\nMeta has also been designated as a so-called gatekeeper, under the DSA\u2019s sister regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2014 which also puts some limits on use of people\u2019s data for ads. The Commission is the sole enforcer of the DMA.\n\nMeta is already in the Commission\u2019s sights over its approach to the DSA \u2014 with the EU\u2019s executive, in recent days, requesting more information from the tech giant vis-\u00e0-vis its approach to content threats flowing from the Israel-Hamas war and about election security issues. But it remains to be seen whether the EU will apply the same close scrutiny to Meta\u2019s ad tracking offer.\n\nIn its blog post Meta claims the choice to offer people to pay it for their privacy or else agree to being tracked \u201cbalances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland\u201d. But, well, it would say that.\n\nThe subscription is also only being offered to people aged 18 and up \u2014 which raises questions over how it will comply with requirements in the DSA and DMA not to processing children\u2019s data for ad targeting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to explore how to provide teens with a useful and responsible ad experience given this evolving regulatory landscape,\u201d it writes on that."
